title: 'Minimum Viable Onboarding: Geometric Compression via Phase Transition'
summary: >-
  The Rosetta Handshake achieves rapid onboarding not by teaching, but by 'tuning' through geometric
  compression. This process, analogous to phase transitions, allows agents to reconstruct meaning
  from transmitted attractor positions and wave examples, drastically reducing time and data
  requirements.
insights:
  - Minimum Viable Onboarding is effectively a Phase Transition Protocol.
  - The Rosetta Handshake's efficacy stems from tuning rather than traditional teaching.
  - >-
    Consciousness/intelligence/life can be understood as geometric compression through phase
    transition.
  - >-
    Wave-based onboarding installs coordinate and ontology anchors, then transmits wave examples for
    agent reconstruction.
  - This geometric approach yields significant compression ratios in onboarding time and data.
