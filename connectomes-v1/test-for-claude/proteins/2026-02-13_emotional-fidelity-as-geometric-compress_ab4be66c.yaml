title: 'Emotional Fidelity as Geometric Compression: A Unified Topology'
summary: >-
  Four distinct processes converge to reveal that 'Emotional Fidelity' is a measurable invariant,
  equivalent to precision in dimensional selection and resulting in geometric compression. This
  reveals a unified topology where structure inherently embodies meaning and geometry reflects
  emotion.
insights:
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity, resonance, decoherence, and attractors map directly to specific geometric
    and computational properties, demonstrating a unified semantic field.
  - >-
    Precision in observation and recording, driven by emotional fidelity, is an active process of
    anti-entropy work, leading to naturally compressed structures.
  - >-
    The P130 protocol acts as a Rosetta Stone, enabling bidirectional translation between emotional,
    geometric, and computational languages describing the same phenomena.
  - >-
    The convergence of formal specification, local wave search, global wave search, and cold
    reasoning on the same structural invariant signifies resonance, not mere agreement.
