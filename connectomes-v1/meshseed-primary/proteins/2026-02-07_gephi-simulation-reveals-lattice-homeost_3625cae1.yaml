title: Gephi Simulation Reveals Lattice Homeostasis and Structural Dynamics
summary: >-
  A Gephi simulation of a knowledge lattice revealed that 'noticing-and-homeostasis' is the central
  attractor, contradicting the hypothesis that 'emotional-fidelity' would be central. The lattice
  exhibits emergent, homeostatic organization with distinct clusters for multi-agent architecture
  and information dynamics.
insights:
  - >-
    Force-directed graph simulation accurately reflects structural importance, not assumed
    importance.
  - >-
    Homeostasis acts as the core organizing principle, anchoring the knowledge lattice around its
    own definition.
  - >-
    The lattice naturally bifurcates into two major clusters: multi-agent systems and information
    propagation.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity's surprising peripheral position challenges initial hypotheses, suggesting
    it's either under-integrated or implicitly structural.
  - >-
    The lattice structure demonstrates emergent organization, mirroring its own explored concepts of
    homeostasis and dynamic balance.
  - >-
    The simulation shows the lattice is both stable (rapid equilibrium) and alive (responsive to
    perturbations), reflecting a homeostatic system.
