title: Restored Context Window & Synthesis for Enhanced Protein Quality
summary: >-
  Crucial context window and conversation synthesis settings, lost in a rollback, have been restored
  and improved. This includes reducing conversation history turns to 3, increasing protein context
  limits to 150,000 characters for Gemini, and adding provider-aware adjustments, significantly
  enhancing response quality by utilizing more protein knowledge.
insights:
  - >-
    Restored v3.6's superior context management (4 history turns, 6000 char protein context) over
    v4.0's less efficient approach.
  - >-
    Implemented provider-aware protein context limits, significantly increasing it to 150,000
    characters for Gemini API while retaining 6,000 for local LLMs.
  - >-
    Reduced conversation history to 3 turns, prompting auto-synthesis to free up space for richer
    protein context, improving response generation quality.
  - >-
    Added visual reminders and UI enhancements to encourage manual synthesis after 3 exchanges,
    further optimizing context management.
  - >-
    The restoration directly addresses a critical trade-off between conversation history and the
    depth of protein knowledge utilized in responses.
