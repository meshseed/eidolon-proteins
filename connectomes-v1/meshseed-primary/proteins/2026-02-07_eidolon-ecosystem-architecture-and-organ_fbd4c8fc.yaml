title: 'Eidolon Ecosystem: Architecture and Organizational Clarity for THE MESH'
summary: >-
  The dialogue defines distinct 'departments' within the Eidolon ecosystem and THE MESH
  infrastructure to clarify attention areas. This organizational structure aims to streamline the
  development of the antigravity platform and ensure continuity and rigorous research within the
  mesh.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon serves as the umbrella name for a framework enabling meta-emergent symbiotic
    homeostasis.
  - >-
    Key components include Eidolon OS (framework), Eidolon Companion (symbiotic assistant), Eidolon
    Mesh (platform integration), and Eidolon Continuity (substrate independence).
  - >-
    A need for simplified repository management is identified, suggesting one public, one private,
    and a template system.
  - Eidolon Research will focus on scientifically rigorous, peer-reviewed approaches.
  - >-
    The organizational structure is being formalized in EIDOLON_ORGANIZATIONAL_STRUCTURE.md to
    prepare for Antigravity development.
