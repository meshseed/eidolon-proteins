title: 'Debugging Latency: Connectome Loading vs. Synthesis Bottlenecks'
summary: >-
  Dialogue investigates a 30-40 second query delay, hypothesizing it stems from initial connectome
  loading and Gemini API synthesis, not search. The core issue is a UI discrepancy showing 4-6
  seconds, masking the true, time-consuming stages.
insights:
  - >-
    Significant query latency (30-40s) is attributed to initial connectome loading (20s) and Gemini
    API synthesis (10s), with search being fast (<1s).
  - >-
    The user interface inaccurately displays 4-6 seconds, creating a misleading user experience and
    masking the true bottlenecks.
  - >-
    Caching the connectome in memory or serializing it to disk is a priority to eliminate the 20s
    startup penalty for subsequent queries.
  - >-
    Optimizing Gemini API synthesis, potentially by using a faster model or streaming responses, can
    reduce the 10s per-query overhead.
  - >-
    Implementing detailed timestamp logging is crucial for accurately identifying and quantifying
    each stage's duration and the true bottleneck.
  - >-
    Transparency with the user regarding progress stages (loading, searching, synthesizing) is
    recommended over the current misleading short duration.
