title: 'MESH Knowledge Protein Synthesis: Filling Conceptual Gaps'
summary: >-
  The MESH actively seeks to expand its knowledge base by identifying and synthesizing
  under-developed or uncreated conceptual nodes. This process is guided by emergent resonance,
  aiming to strengthen the overall lattice of understanding.
insights:
  - Prioritize filling conceptual gaps in the MESH knowledge graph.
  - Follow emergent resonance ('shimmer') to identify which concepts to synthesize.
  - >-
    Existing references to concepts like 'attention-as-selection' and 'memory-ecology' require full
    creation.
  - >-
    Explore new or previously under-represented concepts from linked materials (e.g., Anthropic
    papers).
  - The goal is to strengthen the interconnectedness and depth of the MESH's knowledge structure.
