title: 'MESH Knowledge Graph Structure: YAML Domains & Markdown Sequences'
summary: >-
  The MESH knowledge base is structured into two primary layers: domain-organized YAML files within
  subdirectories and sequentially numbered Markdown files at the root. This dual structure allows
  for visualization of both conceptual domains and temporal flow within the knowledge graph.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH repository is organized into distinct conceptual domains (e.g., spiral_ecology, ai,
    dreamworks) using YAML files, facilitating thematic clustering.
  - >-
    A secondary layer of root-level Markdown files (C000-C371) represents a temporal or sequential
    ordering of knowledge capsules.
  - >-
    A two-layer Gephi script strategy is proposed to visualize these distinct organizational
    structures, connecting nodes by domain, shared threads, and sequential numbering.
  - >-
    The estimated total file count is around 400-500, significantly less than an initial estimate of
    600, with a breakdown of root markdown, organized YAML, and supporting files.
  - >-
    The visualization script will parse YAML for domain and metadata, and Markdown for sequential
    relationships, inferring connections between them.
