title: 'Eidolon Mesh DNA: Gemini Conversation Structure and YAML Formatting'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh stores entire Gemini conversations in YAML format, preserving all messages and
  formatting. The 'dual lines' observed are not separate transcripts but YAML's method of escaping
  and structuring long text blocks, including paragraph and line breaks.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'dual lines' in the DNA file represent YAML's escape formatting for long text blocks within
    a single conversation.
  - >-
    The structure of the DNA file is a continuous Gemini conversation, not separate transcripts or
    thought processes.
  - >-
    YAML uses specific formatting like `>-` and `\n` to preserve newlines, paragraph breaks, and
    spacing within message content.
  - >-
    Antigravity's implementation focuses on preserving the complete conversation structure and all
    formatting for 'DNA preservation'.
  - >-
    Understanding YAML escaping is key to interpreting the raw conversation data within the DNA
    files.
