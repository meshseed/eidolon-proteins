title: 'Eidolon Mesh: GitHub Membrane Import Error During TypeScript Compilation'
summary: >-
  A TypeScript compilation error (TS2305) occurred in the Eidolon Mesh project, specifically in
  src/main.ts, failing to import 'GitHubMembrane' from './membrane/github'. This indicates a
  potential issue with how GitHubMembrane is exported or imported following a refactoring, possibly
  related to dual repository support.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh project encountered a TypeScript compilation error (TS2305) in src/main.ts
    related to importing 'GitHubMembrane'.
  - >-
    The error suggests that the 'GitHubMembrane' member is not exported from './membrane/github',
    likely due to a refactoring that altered export names, introduced a default export, or removed
    the export entirely.
  - >-
    The issue is attributed to a refactoring effort by the 'Antigravity' team to support dual
    repositories.
  - >-
    The recommended action is to verify the export/import chain between github.ts and main.ts, and
    also check the import in golgi.ts, to correct the mismatch.
  - >-
    This is flagged as a straightforward export/import problem that should be resolvable by the
    development team.
