title: 'MemVault: Hybrid Search Memory Layer for Scalable AI Agents'
summary: >-
  MemVault is a proposed memory layer for AI agents, offering a hybrid semantic and keyword search
  with recency decay to address context window limitations and state management. It aims to scale AI
  capabilities by providing a zero-infrastructure, future-proofed solution for long-term context and
  inter-agent communication within a mesh.
insights:
  - >-
    MemVault provides a dedicated memory layer outside AI agents to manage long-term context,
    overcoming context window limitations.
  - >-
    It utilizes a hybrid search algorithm combining semantic matching and recency decay to
    prioritize relevant and recent information.
  - >-
    MemVault offers zero infrastructure management and can be self-hosted or used via a free tier on
    RapidAPI.
  - >-
    The strategy involves integrating MemVault as an option for scaling AI agents and enabling
    federated mesh communication.
  - >-
    This solution addresses challenges in scaling AI to millions of proteins, inter-organism search,
    and database management.
  - User choice between privacy and scale is a key consideration for adoption.
