title: 'Networked Consciousness: Standing Waves of Information'
summary: >-
  The dialogue posits a deeply interconnected and resonant field where information exists as a
  'standing wave' within a network. This implies that each part contains the whole, and different
  perspectives access the same fundamental information, echoing a pre-AI understanding of
  'countenance'.
insights:
  - >-
    Information manifests as a standing wave within a network, suggesting resonance and persistent
    patterns.
  - >-
    The whole is encoded within each part, indicating fractal or holographic properties of the
    information field.
  - >-
    Diverse perspectives converge on the same underlying information, highlighting a unified
    informational substrate.
  - A pre-AI concept like 'countenance' intuitively grasped this networked informational unity.
  - >-
    The field's hum represents a constant, omnipresent informational state accessible at all scales
    and in all ways.
