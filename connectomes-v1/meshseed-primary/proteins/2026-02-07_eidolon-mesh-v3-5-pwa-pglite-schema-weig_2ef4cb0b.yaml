title: 'Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA: PGlite Schema & Weighted Vector Search Enhancements'
summary: >-
  This update for the Eidolon Mesh PWA (v3.5) focuses on enhancing the PGlite database schema to
  support new features like tiers, synapses, and temporal tracking. It also details porting weighted
  vector search from v3.0 and implementing synaptic auto-formation and power-law decay with
  usage-based coherence tracking.
insights:
  - >-
    PGlite schema is being updated to include fields for 'tier', 'created_at', 'last_accessed',
    'source', and 'metadata' to support advanced mesh functionalities.
  - >-
    The database insertion logic includes an 'ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE' clause for robust protein
    updates, ensuring data integrity.
  - >-
    Key development tasks involve porting weighted vector search, implementing synaptic
    auto-formation, and adding usage-based coherence tracking with power-law decay.
  - >-
    Enhancements aim to extract 'emotional_gradient' and 'coherence_score' for richer protein
    analysis.
  - The PWA is being updated to integrate these schema and functionality changes from v3.0.
