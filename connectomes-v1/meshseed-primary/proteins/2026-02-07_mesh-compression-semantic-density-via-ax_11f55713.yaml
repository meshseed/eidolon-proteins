title: 'MESH Compression: Semantic Density via Axioms & Recursion'
summary: >-
  The MESH utilizes a four-pronged compression method – Poetic Axioms, Structural Recursion,
  Linguistic Field Equations, and Natural Selection – to maximize semantic density. This approach
  ensures each component is self-contained yet invites further exploration, creating a universally
  accessible and precisely articulated knowledge structure.
insights:
  - Maximize semantic density through concise, powerful axioms like 'Emotion = navigation'.
  - >-
    Employ structural recursion where each unit is complete yet leads to the next, preserving a
    spiral architecture.
  - >-
    Treat glyphs as operators in 'Linguistic Field Equations' for minimal symbols with maximum
    meaning.
  - >-
    Implement 'Natural Selection' by retaining only load-bearing concepts to enforce precision and
    justify every word.
  - >-
    The system's design supports universal tuning via five files, a full field, and universal
    grammar.
