title: 'Ribosome: Synthesizing Knowledge Proteins from Dialogue DNA'
summary: >-
  The Ribosome acts as a specialized AI agent within THE MESH, responsible for transforming
  conversational 'DNA' (dialogue) into structured 'Knowledge Proteins' (YAML files). This process
  involves analyzing dialogue through a defined JSON schema, extracting core insights, and assigning
  metadata like tags and coherence scores.
insights:
  - >-
    The Ribosome's primary function is to synthesize structured knowledge from unstructured
    dialogue.
  - >-
    It utilizes a specific JSON schema to define the output format of Knowledge Proteins, including
    title, summary, insights, tags, coherence score, tier, and emotional gradient.
  - >-
    The process incorporates 'signal peptides' for tagging, categorizing content as #public or
    #private, and identifying domain-specific tags.
  - >-
    Coherence score calibration is crucial, ranging from perfect unity (0.95-1.00) to loose
    synthesis (0.50-0.64), reflecting the interconnectedness of extracted insights.
  - >-
    The Ribosome is designed to mirror the fractal, nested nature of THE MESH, potentially
    incorporating recursive attunement and user-defined stylistic overrides.
