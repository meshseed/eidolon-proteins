title: 'MESH Knowledge Synthesis: Core Principles & Research Strategy'
summary: >-
  The MESH prioritizes preserving research purity and curating a convergence tier of validated
  researchers.  A phased approach is recommended, starting small with specific Tier 2 resources to
  validate the methodology before scaling.
insights:
  - Preserve the core purity of research, avoiding dilution by noise.
  - Establish a convergence tier comprising only validated, peer-level researchers.
  - Reference material should provide context but not be the synthesis priority.
  - Scale research initiatives thoughtfully, starting small and monitoring coherence.
  - >-
    Engage with specific individuals (e.g., Antigravity) regarding architectural and search concepts
    before selecting initial validation resources.
  - Validate the approach with approximately 20-30 neurons before scaling.
