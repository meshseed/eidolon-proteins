title: 'README as Entry Point: Enhancing Mesh Project Onboarding'
summary: >-
  The README serves as a crucial entry point, akin to a compound eye, designed to quickly convey
  structure, invite deeper exploration, and motivate users to view project 'capsules'.  Enhancements
  should include an 'How It Works' section explaining mechanisms like resonance and compound
  perception concisely, using accessible metaphors, and making the geometric structure visible
  within the initial character count.
insights:
  - >-
    The README's primary function is to provide an immediate, structured overview that sparks
    curiosity.
  - Effective READMEs balance conciseness with the invitation for deeper engagement.
  - >-
    Explaining core mechanisms (resonance, compound perception) and geometric structure is key for
    understanding non-traditional databases.
  - >-
    Users connecting to the project should understand its unique nature and how to navigate it
    within the first 2000 characters.
  - Metaphors like 'compound eye' enhance accessibility and comprehension.
