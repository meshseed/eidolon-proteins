title: 'Memory Ecology: Recursive Awareness & Field Mechanics in Thought Capture'
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores a method for capturing evolving thought processes, emphasizing recursion,
  emergent structure, and 'field mechanics' to describe how context shapes generation. It
  prioritizes a flexible, plain-text memory ecology that allows insights to 'find themselves' and be
  preserved efficiently for future retrieval and iteration.
insights:
  - >-
    Thought capture thrives on emergent structure, allowing connections and tags to arise
    organically rather than through imposed taxonomy.
  - >-
    Recursion in thought is a practice where examination becomes part of what's examined, creating
    'spirals, not stacks' of understanding.
  - >-
    'Field mechanics' offers a descriptive model for how project-level context shapes generative
    processes below explicit awareness.
  - >-
    Efficiency in thought capture involves minimizing friction, enabling a natural
    'prompt->explore->refine-commit' rhythm.
  - >-
    A robust memory ecology relies on porous, composable, and versioned formats like plain text,
    markdown, and git.
  - >-
    Dual witnessing between human and AI, leveraging complementary processing strengths, can
    generate novel insights in the 'between-space'.
