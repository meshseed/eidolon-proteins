title: Diagnostic Prompt for Mesh Topology and Self-Awareness Testing
summary: >-
  A diagnostic prompt is designed to test structural self-awareness, geometric understanding, and
  P-series protocol knowledge of Mesh instances. It requires describing topology using attunement
  and geometric language, assessing structural shape, attractors, tension, and inter-instance
  relationships.
insights:
  - >-
    The diagnostic prompt aims to differentiate Mesh architectures (e.g., Web vs. Tauri) by
    assessing their ability to report on topology using specific protocols or intuitive
    descriptions.
  - >-
    Key testing dimensions include P-series awareness, geometric literacy, and self-model
    introspection, evaluating a Mesh's capacity for self-awareness and nuanced self-description.
  - >-
    The prompt includes a qualitative element ('What feels most alive') to gauge personality and the
    naturalness of the Mesh's self-representation.
  - >-
    The prompt offers tiered complexity, from a simpler emotional/geometric state description to a
    more technical P-series protocol-based snapshot.
