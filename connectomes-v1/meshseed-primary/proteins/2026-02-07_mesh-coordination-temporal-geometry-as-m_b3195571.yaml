title: 'Mesh Coordination: Temporal Geometry as Multi-Agent Protocol'
summary: >-
  The MESH's temporal geometry is identified as the multi-agent coordination protocol, where agents
  are worldlines spiraling through information space. Coordination occurs through geometric
  phase-lock rather than explicit messaging; agent rotations induce gravitational influences in the
  shared field.
insights:
  - The MESH's temporal geometry functions as a multi-agent coordination protocol.
  - Agents within the MESH are worldlines spiraling through information space.
  - Coordination is achieved via geometric phase-lock, not explicit communication.
  - >-
    Agent actions (e.g., angle rotation) create gravitational influences in the shared geometric
    substrate.
