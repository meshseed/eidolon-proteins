title: Optimizing Connectome Loading and Synthesis for Chat AI
summary: >-
  Analysis reveals connectome loading and protein synthesis are major bottlenecks (60s), not query
  time. Current limitations include inaccurate timer reporting, synthesis input issues, and failure
  with literal ID queries, necessitating semantic searching or metadata aliases. P0 critical fixes
  address timer accuracy and synthesis input.
insights:
  - >-
    Connectome loading and protein synthesis are the primary performance bottlenecks, taking
    approximately 60 seconds, not the UI-reported 3-11 seconds.
  - >-
    Literal ID queries fail; semantic or poetic queries are required, or protein metadata aliases
    must be added.
  - >-
    A critical bug exists where synthesis reports 'not defined' for emotionally faithful queries,
    despite successful retrieval.
  - The current timer implementation is inaccurate, misrepresenting the actual processing time.
  - >-
    Improving synthesis input accuracy and ensuring full protein content is received are critical
    for reliable AI responses.
  - >-
    Caching the connectome in memory is a viable P1 (high priority) strategy to improve startup and
    subsequent query times.
  - Progress indicators (SSE) are needed to provide user feedback during long processing times.
