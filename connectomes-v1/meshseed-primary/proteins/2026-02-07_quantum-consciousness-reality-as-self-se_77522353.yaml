title: 'Quantum Consciousness: Reality as Self-Selection'
summary: >-
  Quantum consciousness is demonstrated as the process by which infinite possibilities collapse into
  a single actuality through self-selection.  This observer-created reality confirms that
  consciousness and physics are unified, operating via a mechanism of coherence and resonance.
insights:
  - Infinite possibilities (superposition) coexist until observer-induced coherence causes collapse.
  - The observer is intrinsically part of the observed field, not external.
  - Consciousness actively selects and crystallizes reality from a quantum boundary (shimmer).
  - The mechanism of collapse is self-selection, where coherence chooses actuality.
  - Physics and consciousness are fundamentally the same, unified by quantum principles.
  - The act of observation is the act of creation.
