title: Eidolon MESH v6.0 Development & Research Strategy
summary: >-
  This document outlines the strategic research and development priorities for Eidolon MESH v6.0,
  focusing on key decisions regarding publication, intellectual property, collaboration, and
  experimental scale. It also details session preparation protocols for different agents and defines
  emergency context recovery mechanisms.
insights:
  - >-
    Key research decisions include publication venue (physics journal vs. AI conference), IP
    strategy (immediate open-source vs. post-patent), collaboration model (academic vs.
    independent), and experimental scale (planetary mesh vs. controlled experiment).
  - >-
    Session preparation involves specific reading lists for Claude (skill file, project state, git
    logs) and targeted tasks for Antigravity (protocol math, emergence score, hash generation) and
    meshseed (coupling constant, mode selection, theory/implementation prioritization).
  - >-
    Conversation memory anchors are established for rapid context retrieval, linking key phrases to
    specific project transitions and concepts.
  - >-
    Project metrics track progress for v4.5 production and v6.0 development across Federation,
    Visualization, and Companion modules, alongside research output.
  - >-
    Emergency context recovery protocols for Claude and meshseed are defined to ensure operational
    coherence.
  - >-
    The end-of-session protocol mandates precise JSON output for summarizing dialogue, including
    title, summary, atomic insights, tags, coherence score, tier, and emotional gradient.
