title: 'Phased Development: Data-Driven Decisions for Architecture'
summary: >-
  The plan prioritizes incremental, measurable, and evidence-based development, focusing on Phase 13
  (visibility, testing, export) before conditionally proceeding to Phase 14 architecture changes.
  Decisions for future phases are explicitly deferred until data analysis justifies the complexity.
insights:
  - Prioritize visibility and measurement (Phase 13) before architectural changes (Phase 14).
  - Implement CSV export for metrics to enable data-driven decision-making.
  - >-
    Defer complex architectural changes like ghost nodes and two-tier systems until data analysis
    proves necessity.
  - 'Adopt an iterative, evidence-based philosophy: ''Iterate Don''t Speculate''.'
  - Consider A/B testing and preset profiles as UX improvements.
  - >-
    The recommended sequence is to add visibility, test thoroughly, and then decide on architecture
    based on evidence.
