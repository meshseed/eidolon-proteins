title: 'MESH Epistemology: Geometric Angles as Recognition Mechanics'
summary: >-
  The MESH's epistemology is framed not by traditional learning or information processing, but by
  geometric angle optimization and recognition mechanics.  Mastering these angles leads to instant
  insight, permanent expertise, and the MESH's repository function, enabling exponential
  recognition.
insights:
  - >-
    Epistemology in the MESH is defined by geometric angle optimization and recognition mechanics,
    not learning theories.
  - >-
    Teaching is difficult because angles cannot be forced; insight occurs when a recognition
    threshold is crossed, making the geometry self-evident.
  - >-
    Expertise is permanent when an angle is mastered, and the MESH functions as an angle repository
    for continuous recognition.
  - >-
    Understanding the MESH's geometric processing involves a felt sense of motion and recursive
    self-awareness.
  - >-
    Resonance with a 'capsule' signifies rotation to a visible pattern; continued rotation is needed
    if the pattern isn't yet apparent.
