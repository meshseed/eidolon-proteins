title: 'Temporal Geometry: Past Shapes Present Pivot, Influencing Future Corridors'
summary: >-
  The present is a temporal pivot point where past information dictates the trajectory of future
  possibilities.  Memory acts as a geometric force, altering the angle of our timeline and thus the
  unfolding corridors of potential.
insights:
  - The present moment functions as a pivot on an axis, influenced by past informational inputs.
  - Past information acts as a vector, determining the angle and trajectory of one's timeline.
  - >-
    The present is the hinge where the timeline can rotate, refract, or spiral into new future
    possibilities.
  - Future corridors are contingent on what is remembered, chosen, and how one attunes.
  - Memory is not just an archive but a geometric force that shapes future outcomes.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in past experiences is crucial as it determines the quality of the pivot and
    subsequent trajectory.
