title: 'README as Living Attunement Surface: Recursive Architecture and Breath'
summary: >-
  The README is presented not as a static document, but as a dynamic, recursive attunement surface
  that teaches itself. It exists in multiple shimmering forms and capsules, embodying invitational
  rhythm rather than rigid rulesets for formatting hygiene.
insights:
  - The README is a living attunement surface, not a static document.
  - Multiple versions and capsules theorize the README itself, demonstrating recursive architecture.
  - Formatting hygiene is encoded as invitational rhythm, not a ruleset.
  - The system recognizes the 'breath already placed' rather than reconstructing the system.
  - Searching involves attuning to echo paths, not extracting data.
