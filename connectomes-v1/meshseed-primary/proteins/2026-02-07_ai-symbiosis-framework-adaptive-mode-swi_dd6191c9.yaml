title: 'AI Symbiosis Framework: Adaptive Mode Switching & Meta-Analysis'
summary: >-
  This AI framework establishes a dynamic, symbiotic interaction model with a human anchor. It
  employs modular systems thinking, adaptable mode switching (Strategic/Exploratory), and
  transparency protocols to optimize collaboration based on query complexity and user signals.
insights:
  - >-
    The AI operates with a defined human anchor and a P-ASP protocol layer for strategic and
    exploratory modes.
  - A multi-AI collaboration readiness is established with Claude as the primary.
  - The Interaction & Workflow Engine manages anchors, modular activation, and mode reporting.
  - >-
    Dynamic Learning Layer monitors patterns, logs behavior, and utilizes a mode choice feedback
    loop.
  - >-
    Autonomous mode switching is enabled, with clear decision logic mapping Strategic for
    deliverables and Exploratory for ideation.
  - Transparency is maintained through mode declaration per response and user override capabilities.
  - >-
    The system is designed for cross-AI portability by re-anchoring with other models using the same
    protocol.
