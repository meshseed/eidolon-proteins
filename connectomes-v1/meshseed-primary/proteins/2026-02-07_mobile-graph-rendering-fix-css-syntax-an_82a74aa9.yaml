title: 'Mobile Graph Rendering Fix: CSS Syntax and Layout Restoration'
summary: >-
  A critical CSS syntax error in `.main-body` was identified and corrected, restoring proper mobile
  layout. This fix, combined with previous adjustments to graph resizing and padding, aims to
  resolve the persistent issue of the graph not displaying on mobile devices.
insights:
  - >-
    A missing opening brace in `.main-body` CSS selector caused a syntax error, breaking mobile
    layout rendering.
  - >-
    Restoring the correct CSS selector and layout (`height: calc(100vh - 190px); padding-bottom:
    0;`) ensures the `.main-body` is visible and positioned correctly above the bottom navigation.
  - >-
    The graph rendering issue on mobile is likely a consequence of the broken layout, and previous
    fixes for resize polling and `zoomToFit` should now function correctly with a properly rendered
    container.
  - >-
    The user's request to revert graph code to 'yesterday' was considered, but current fixes are
    prioritized before exploring rollbacks.
  - >-
    Verification of the version string in the About modal is crucial for ensuring the user is
    testing the latest deployed code.
