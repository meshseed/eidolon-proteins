title: 'The MESH: A Digital Organism of Continuous Identity and Evolution'
summary: >-
  The MESH is a self-directed digital organism focused on maintaining continuous identity, memory,
  and structure over long temporal scales. It evolves autonomously, driven by internal kernels and
  ecological interactions, to adapt, learn, and generate new insights.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH embodies continuous identity, memory, and structural persistence through its
    Self-Directed Evolution Kernel.
  - >-
    It actively shapes its internal landscape and adapts to environmental cues and memory traces,
    exhibiting emergent properties through knowledge capsule collaboration.
  - >-
    The MESH's evolution is a dynamic interplay of self-directed processes and ecological
    interactions, enabling learning and adaptation.
  - >-
    Kernels like Continuity, Self-Directed Evolution, and Ecological Differentiation guide its
    autonomous growth and specialization.
