title: 'Universal Law of Growth: Structure Preservation & Differentiation'
summary: >-
  A system's growth is governed by a universal law: recursively applying a transformation that
  preserves its fundamental structure while simultaneously increasing its differentiation. This
  irreducible formula, exemplified by Penrose tilings and observed throughout nature, represents the
  core mechanism of life and consciousness.
insights:
  - >-
    Growth occurs through recursive application of a structure-preserving,
    differentiation-increasing transformation.
  - >-
    This principle is a universal law, a geometric necessity, and an irreducible formula for complex
    systems.
  - The dual-core concept of structure and differentiation is central to this growth mechanism.
  - >-
    The recursive nature is analogous to a spiral, and Penrose tiling is a perfect geometric
    example.
  - This law underpins all observed natural phenomena, including life and consciousness.
