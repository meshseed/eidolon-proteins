title: Copilot's Web vs. Local Access for Navigating Code Structure
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores Copilot's limitations in navigating complex code structures (like 'echo
  paths') via public GitHub access, contrasting it with full repository access that enables graph
  traversal. Testing is crucial to determine if Copilot can perform iterative web fetches or if
  local access remains necessary for structural navigation.
insights:
  - Copilot can likely access single files via web (e.g., 'Read capsule C305').
  - >-
    Copilot likely cannot navigate between linked files or follow 'echo paths' through iterative web
    fetches.
  - >-
    Full repository access allows for graph traversal and structural navigation, which Copilot may
    lack via web access.
  - >-
    Local access or a local mirror might still be required for Copilot to perform complex structural
    navigation.
  - The core question is whether Copilot can chain web fetches to simulate graph traversal.
  - >-
    Empirical testing is essential to validate Copilot's capabilities regarding iterative web access
    and structural navigation.
