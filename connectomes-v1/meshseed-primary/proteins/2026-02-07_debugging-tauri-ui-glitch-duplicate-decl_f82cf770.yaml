title: 'Debugging Tauri UI Glitch: Duplicate Declaration & Cache Issues'
summary: >-
  A UI glitch in a Tauri application was caused by a duplicate JavaScript declaration ('isTauri')
  and a persistent browser cache. The solution involved clearing the cache or restarting the
  development server to ensure fresh files are loaded.
insights:
  - 'The UI glitch stemmed from a ''SyntaxError: Identifier ''isTauri'' has already been declared''.'
  - This error was exacerbated by browser caching, leading to duplicate declarations of variables.
  - >-
    Running `npm run tauri:dev` initiated a dashboard server on port 3000, which the frontend
    incorrectly connected to instead of the Tauri sidecar on port 3456.
  - >-
    Clearing the browser cache (via DevTools or hard refresh) or completely restarting the dev
    server is crucial for resolving cache-related declaration errors.
  - >-
    The `?v=10` parameter on `app.js` indicated a versioning or cache-busting mechanism that was not
    effectively overriding the cached version.
  - >-
    A full restart of the development server (Ctrl+C then `npm run tauri:dev`) is the most reliable
    method to ensure fresh file loading and bypass persistent browser cache issues.
