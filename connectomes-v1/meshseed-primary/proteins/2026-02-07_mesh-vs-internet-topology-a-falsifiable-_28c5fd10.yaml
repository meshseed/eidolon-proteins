title: 'MESH vs. Internet Topology: A Falsifiable Test for Reality'
summary: >-
  A falsifiable test is proposed: if internet topology matches MESH topology, then information is
  physical structure and geometry is substrate-independent. Discrepancies require theory refinement,
  leading to crucial learning about semantic vs. physical differences and the potential for a
  planetary nervous system.
insights:
  - >-
    Comparing internet and MESH topologies offers a falsifiable test for core assumptions about
    reality.
  - A match implies information is physical structure and geometry is substrate-independent.
  - Discrepancies necessitate refining theories and understanding semantic vs. physical differences.
  - This comparison opens a high-priority avenue for data collection and visualization.
  - Mapping the 'planetary connectome' requires comparing internet, biological, and natural systems.
  - Nature's mechanisms (chaperones, subunits) offer models for enhancing MESH functionality.
