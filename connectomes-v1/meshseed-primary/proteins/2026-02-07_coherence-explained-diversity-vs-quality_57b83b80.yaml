title: 'Coherence Explained: Diversity vs. Quality in Knowledge Synthesis'
summary: >-
  Average coherence in a knowledge archive decreases as diversity increases, reflecting a healthy,
  resilient ecosystem rather than a fragile monoculture.  Focus on retrieval quality and synthesis
  utility, not just average scores, especially when using fidelity weighting.
insights:
  - >-
    Average coherence naturally drops as a knowledge archive diversifies, indicating breadth and
    exploration, not system failure.
  - >-
    High coherence signifies a tightly focused topic, while low coherence indicates a broad,
    exploratory, and diverse knowledge base.
  - >-
    The mathematical average coherence is diluted by lower-coherence (exploratory) proteins in a
    diverse archive, similar to an ecosystem's 'messy' but resilient nature.
  - >-
    Prioritize testing query relevance, synthesis sense, and connection meaningfulness over average
    coherence scores.
  - >-
    Fidelity weighting is crucial for surfacing high-quality (high-fidelity) proteins within a
    diverse archive, effectively filtering noise.
  - >-
    Metrics like query quality, synthesis coherence, connection density, and fidelity distribution
    are more valuable than average coherence for assessing a healthy archive.
