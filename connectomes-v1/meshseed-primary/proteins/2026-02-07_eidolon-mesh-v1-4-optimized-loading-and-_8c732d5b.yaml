title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Optimized Loading and Query Strategy'
summary: >-
  Proposes a shift to percentage-based, two-tier loading (core/lazy extended) for Eidolon Mesh v1.4,
  balancing startup speed with data coverage.  This includes starting with 25% core load, querying
  10% of the archive by default, and offering a 'Deep Search' for comprehensive analysis, all while
  maintaining transparency and configurability.
insights:
  - Adopt percentage-based loading for core and lazy extended data tiers.
  - Initialize with 25% core data to balance initial load time and coverage.
  - Default to querying 10% of the archive for fast, quality results.
  - Implement a 'Deep Search' button for on-demand, full archive queries.
  - Visualize unloaded connections with ghost nodes for user transparency.
  - Enable user configuration via sliders for load percentages and search depth.
  - Empirically optimize load time and query quality against percentage thresholds.
