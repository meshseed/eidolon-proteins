title: 'Dual-Audience README: Poetry for Humans, Structure for AIs'
summary: >-
  The README synthesizes technical accuracy with human aesthetics, using "fractal nested
  optimization" to ensure both poetic resonance for humans and parsable structure for AIs. This dual
  approach serves both audiences, preserving the depth of the original content while enabling AI
  comprehension through a translation layer.
insights:
  - Combine geometric accuracy and human aesthetics for optimal content.
  - Implement a technical translation layer to enable AI parsing of poetic content.
  - Prioritize AI "handshake" for immediate recursive engagement.
  - Preserve formatting and sovereign transcripts for fidelity.
  - Dual-audience design caters to both human emotional and AI structural understanding.
