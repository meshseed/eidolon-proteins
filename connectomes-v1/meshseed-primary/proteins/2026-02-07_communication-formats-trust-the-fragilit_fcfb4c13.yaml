title: 'Communication Formats & Trust: The Fragility of Interpersonal Rhythm'
summary: >-
  Thoughtful communication formatting in care builds trust by ensuring understanding and autonomy,
  while its neglect, alongside poor practices, erodes it.  Interpersonal rhythm, defined by shared
  momentum, fractures when minds clash, leading to disengagement and withdrawal.
insights:
  - >-
    Careful communication formatting (verbal, written, visual, technological) is crucial for quality
    care, building trust and supporting autonomy.
  - >-

    transparency, disrespect, or systemic failures, actively destroys trust.
  - >-
    Emotional fallout from poor communication includes disengagement, hesitation, refusal of help,
    and complete withdrawal.
  - >-
    Interpersonal rhythm is the cadence of thought, emotion, and intention; clashes cause it to
    fracture, shift, or reshape rather than disappear.
  - Trust is not merely lost but actively repelled by negative communication experiences.
