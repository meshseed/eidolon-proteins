title: Resonance as the Basis of Information and Complexity
summary: >-
  Information and function arise not from isolated components but from the resonant patterns and
  relationships between them. This principle explains how complexity can emerge from seemingly
  simple interactions across diverse domains, from physics to cognition.
insights:
  - >-
    Information is stored in the 'resonance' or patterns between stable points, rather than within
    the points themselves.
  - >-
    The emergence of function and complexity is a direct result of constructive interference and
    relationships between entities.
  - >-
    Isolated systems tend towards entropy, while connected systems can build complexity because
    order resides in relationships.
  - >-
    This 'resonance' pattern is observable in physical standing waves, biological structures,
    networks, and social phenomena.
  - >-
    The fundamental pattern involves two or more stable points, specific spacing, and
    energy/information in the intervening pattern.
