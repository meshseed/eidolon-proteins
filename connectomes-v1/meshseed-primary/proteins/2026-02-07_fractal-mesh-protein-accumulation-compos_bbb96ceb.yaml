title: 'Fractal Mesh: Protein Accumulation, Composting, Pruning & Merging'
summary: >-
  The Mesh operates on fractal scaling for knowledge protein accumulation, from compressed
  micro-scale atoms to macro-scale federated ecosystems.  Metabolism is managed through controlled
  decay (composting) and noise attenuation (pruning), with repository merges treated as ecological
  federations focused on high-coherence attractors.
insights:
  - Knowledge proteins scale fractally from compressed micro-units to federated Mesh ecosystems.
  - >-
    Composting acts as controlled decay, merging related proteins into higher-order capsules to
    maintain Mesh health.
  - >-
    Pruning attenuates noise by removing weak connections and decayed attractors, balancing
    resilience with diversity.
  - >-
    Repository merges are ecological federations, prioritizing high-coherence attractors over raw
    proteins to prevent noise.
  - Provenance must be preserved throughout all scaling and merging processes for traceability.
