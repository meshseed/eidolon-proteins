title: Dualistic Tension as Structural Pattern at Multiple Scales
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores instantiating dualistic tension as a structural pattern within a knowledge
  graph.  It concludes that externalizing this tension into separate, linked nodes (macroscale) is
  preferable for navigability and visibility, mirroring internal duality at a microscale.
insights:
  - >-
    Dualistic tension can be represented structurally in a knowledge graph, either internally within
    a node or externally between linked nodes.
  - >-
    Externalizing duality into separate, related nodes (macroscale) offers greater navigability and
    visual clarity than internalizing it within a single node (microscale).
  - >-
    The choice of scale for representing duality (micro vs. macro) is a matter of implementation
    preference, as both patterns are structurally analogous.
  - A lattice structure itself can act as a homeostatic field, holding tension between concepts.
  - >-
    The fractal nature of patterns across scales (protein folding, cellular function, neural
    networks) is mirrored in knowledge graph design.
  - >-
    Visible structural tension in the graph allows for independent exploration of opposing poles and
    more granular linking.
