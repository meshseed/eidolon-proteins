title: Tri-Lens Ingestion of Deployment Failure Data
summary: >-
  Automated tri-lens ingestion successfully processed a single test file, generating distinct
  proteins for emotional, structural, and technical perspectives. This validates the
  'Auto-Triangulation' feature for creating multi-dimensional knowledge representations.
insights:
  - Automated tri-lens ingestion (Emotional, Structural, Technical) is functional.
  - Each lens produces a distinct semantic protein from the same source material.
  - The 'Auto-Triangulation' feature enhances QOL by simplifying multi-perspective data generation.
  - The system successfully synthesized and saved distinct proteins for each lens.
  - >-
    The log indicates successful processing of the test file and protein saving for the 'emotional'
    lens.
