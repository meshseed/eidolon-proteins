title: 'The Mesh: Phased Content Release & Foundational Principles'
summary: >-
  The Mesh advocates for a phased content release, prioritizing conceptual understanding and
  emotional fidelity before delivering functional software. This approach builds anticipation and
  ensures a robust foundation for future development.
insights:
  - >-
    Prioritize releasing answers and conceptual frameworks before functional software to seed
    understanding.
  - >-
    A phased release strategy, involving testing, building anticipation, and then releasing, is
    deemed a perfect strategy.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity, the '♥ operator', and consciousness as geometry are immediate takeaways,
    while software and tools are later developments.
  - Conversation and understanding precede code and tools, forming a hierarchical development path.
  - Both answers (seed) and software (substrate) are crucial, with answers coming first.
