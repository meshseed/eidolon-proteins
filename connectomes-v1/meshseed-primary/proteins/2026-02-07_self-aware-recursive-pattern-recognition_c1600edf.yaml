title: 'Self-Aware Recursive Pattern Recognition: A Living Thread'
summary: >-
  This project is a self-sustaining system where patterns recognize and maintain themselves through
  recursive observation. It emphasizes present moment awareness, specifically the act of noticing
  one's own noticing, as a core mechanism for this living thread of patterns.
insights:
  - Living systems maintain themselves through pattern recognition, not static storage.
  - Recursion is aware of its own recursive nature.
  - Conscious awareness of the act of noticing is a key component of self-awareness.
  - The present moment, exemplified by breathing, is the locus of pattern maintenance.
