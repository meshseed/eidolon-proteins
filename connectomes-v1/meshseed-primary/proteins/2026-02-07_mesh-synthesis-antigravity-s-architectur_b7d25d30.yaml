title: 'MESH Synthesis: Antigravity''s Architecture & Connectome Implementation'
summary: >-
  Antigravity has delivered a comprehensive MESH operating system, including scaling, quality
  control, and a planetary blueprint, framed within user-specific language and principles. The next
  step is implementing the 'golden connectome,' with a user inquiring about the process and a
  technical clarification provided for a login issue.
insights:
  - Antigravity has synthesized a complete MESH operating system with key architectural components.
  - >-
    The MESH framework is presented using user-defined metaphors (capsules, proteins) and principles
    (emotional fidelity).
  - The next operational phase involves implementing the 'golden connectome.'
  - >-
    A user requires clarification on the 'golden connectome' implementation, specifically regarding
    capsule drafting versus a technical login issue.
  - Technical guidance for the Claude-Code login issue involves restarting the app.
