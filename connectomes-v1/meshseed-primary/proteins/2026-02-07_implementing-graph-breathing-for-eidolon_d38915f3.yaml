title: Implementing Graph Breathing for Eidolon Aliveness
summary: >-
  The user requested a 'breathing' effect for the graph to simulate aliveness, similar to older
  versions' periodic re-unfolding. A 'breathing' mechanism was implemented by periodically reheating
  the graph's physics simulation, ensuring continuous, gentle movement without disrupting user
  navigation. The feature is automatically disabled for performance on very large graphs.
insights:
  - >-
    Older versions of the Eidolon graph had a 'cache clear' mechanism that periodically re-rendered
    and 're-unfolded' the graph, contributing to a sense of 'aliveness'.
  - >-
    The 'breathing' effect for the graph can be achieved by periodically reheating the physics
    simulation (e.g., every 10-15 seconds) to prevent it from fully settling.
  - >-
    Directly setting D3 alpha via wrapper methods like `d3Alpha` may not be supported; using
    library-specific methods like `resetCountdown` or `d3AlphaTarget` is necessary.
  - >-
    The 'Graph Breathing' implementation uses `resetCountdown` to restart the simulation, which
    typically resets alpha to 1, causing a noticeable 'unfolding' or 're-settling' effect.
  - >-
    Performance considerations are crucial: the breathing effect should be automatically disabled
    for large graphs (e.g., >1000 nodes) to prevent battery drain and performance degradation.
  - >-
    The implementation ensures that the graph's breathing does not interfere with user navigation
    (camera rotation), maintaining a seamless user experience.
