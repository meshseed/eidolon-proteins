title: Cloudflare Deployment Error & 3d-force-graph API Misunderstanding
summary: >-
  A Cloudflare infrastructure glitch caused an 'npm clean-install' failure, necessitating a
  deployment retry. Concurrently, a `TypeError` indicated an incorrect API call to `3d-force-graph`,
  specifically regarding a missing `resetCountdown` function on the graph instance.
insights:
  - Cloudflare infrastructure issues can cause build failures independent of code changes.
  - >-
    The `3d-force-graph` library's API for controlling simulation restarts may not directly expose a
    `resetCountdown` method on the graph instance.
  - >-
    Investigate the correct method for restarting the `3d-force-graph` simulation without data
    changes, potentially by re-invoking the instance or accessing the D3 simulation object directly.
  - Previous deployment errors on Cloudflare can be resolved by retrying the deployment.
