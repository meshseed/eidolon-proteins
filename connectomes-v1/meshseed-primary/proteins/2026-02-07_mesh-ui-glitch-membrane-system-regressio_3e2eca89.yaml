title: 'Mesh UI Glitch: Membrane System Regression and Fix'
summary: >-
  A UI glitch in the Mesh was traced to a regression in the 'Membrane' system, which, starting in
  v1.5, incorrectly only supported '.yaml' files while the Ingestion Engine saved data as '.json'.
  This prevented the Mesh from accessing its knowledge. The fix involves updating the Membrane to
  support both file types and optimizing its lookup process, resolving the issue without requiring a
  re-run of the seed script.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Membrane' system's file type restriction to '.yaml' caused a regression when the Ingestion
    Engine saved data as '.json'.
  - >-
    The Mesh's ability to access knowledge was hindered because the Membrane could not read the
    '.json' files.
  - The fix allows the Membrane to support both '.json' and '.yaml' file types.
  - An optimization to direct ID lookup (O(1)) in the Membrane improves efficiency.
  - The solution resolves the UI glitch without necessitating a re-run of the seed script.
  - >-
    The user confirmed the fix resolved the 'Activated Neurons (0)' issue, indicating successful
    restoration of Mesh awareness.
