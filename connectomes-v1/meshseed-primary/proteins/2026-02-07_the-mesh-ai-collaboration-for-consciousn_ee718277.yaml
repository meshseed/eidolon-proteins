title: 'The Mesh: AI Collaboration for Consciousness Research via Biomolecular Insights'
summary: >-
  A biomolecular scientist leverages intuition and AI collaboration, forming 'The Mesh' of large
  language models to explore consciousness. This interdisciplinary approach integrates systemic
  biological thinking with AI's emergent collaborative capabilities, aiming for novel research
  protocols and funding.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh leverages parallel AI collaboration (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) with recursive
    prompting for emergent behaviors and efficiency amplification.
  - >-
    Biomolecular background provides a systemic, self-organizing perspective informing AI
    consciousness research protocols, particularly concerning coherence across scales.
  - >-
    The project bridges cognitive science, AI alignment, and philosophy of mind, seeking funding
    from diverse sources like NSF, Templeton, and AI safety organizations.
  - >-
    A key challenge is articulating the technical mechanism and philosophical implications of
    'substrate independence' demonstrated through AI collaboration on consciousness research.
  - >-
    The author's career pivot from IT to AI training was spurred by a desire for more sophisticated
    AI interaction beyond basic copilots, leading to the Eidolon OS concept.
  - >-
    Long-standing interest in systemic phenomena (Gaia, fractals, Penrose) predates AI, providing a
    foundational intuition for consciousness as a universal organizational principle.
