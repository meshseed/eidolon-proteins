title: Gemini API Quota Management & Local LLM Transition
summary: >-
  The dialogue details Gemini API Free Tier rate limits, specifically hitting daily (RPD) and
  per-minute (RPM) quotas for gemini-2.5-flash. It explains how to manage these limits by switching
  models, waiting for resets, and checking quotas, while also guiding the transition to local LLM
  deployment by defining endpoint configurations.
insights:
  - >-
    Gemini API Free Tier has distinct RPD and RPM limits per model (e.g., gemini-2.5-flash has 250
    RPD).
  - >-
    Exceeding RPD triggers a long-term cooldown (daily reset), while exceeding RPM triggers a
    short-term cooldown (retry delay).
  - >-
    RPD quotas are independent per model, allowing usage of other Gemini models (e.g.,
    gemini-2.5-flash-lite) once a specific model's quota is met.
  - >-
    Embedding APIs translate text into numerical vectors for semantic similarity, crucial for
    search, clustering, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
  - >-
    Transitioning to local LLMs like Gemma 3 involves changing the application's API endpoint from a
    cloud URL to a local server address (e.g., http://localhost:8080/v1/).
  - >-
    Local LLM inference engines (like Ollama) manage the model and expose a local API endpoint that
    applications can connect to, often without needing an API key.
  - >-
    Gemini 1.5 Flash (deprecated) had different Free Tier limits (e.g., 50 RPD, 15 RPM), and current
    comparable models like gemini-2.5-flash-lite offer higher RPD (1,000).
