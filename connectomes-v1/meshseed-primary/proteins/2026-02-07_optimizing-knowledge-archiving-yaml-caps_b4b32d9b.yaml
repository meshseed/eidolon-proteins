title: 'Optimizing Knowledge Archiving: YAML Capsules and Markdown Navigation'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines an evolving knowledge archiving system, transitioning from plain text to
  structured YAML 'capsules' for data and human-readable Markdown 'READMEs' for navigation. The core
  insight is a dual-layer architecture where READMEs act as interpretive indexes for collections of
  YAML data, proposing hybrid approaches for integration with tools like Obsidian.
insights:
  - Knowledge archiving has evolved from .txt to .md and now primarily to structured .yaml capsules.
  - >-
    A dual-layer architecture uses Markdown READMEs for human navigation and YAML files for
    structured data storage within domains.
  - >-
    The proposed optimal integration strategy involves keeping YAML pristine, enhancing READMEs with
    wikilinks, and optionally generating markdown stubs for Obsidian graph visualization.
  - >-
    Consolidating the archive into a single repository with clear structure facilitates human
    access, machine optimization, and visualization.
  - >-
    The system aims to maintain YAML as the authoritative data source while providing rich,
    navigable human interfaces.
