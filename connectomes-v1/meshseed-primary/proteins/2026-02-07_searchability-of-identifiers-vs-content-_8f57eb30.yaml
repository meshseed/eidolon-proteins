title: Searchability of Identifiers vs. Content in Knowledge Retrieval
summary: >-
  Directly querying for capsule identifiers (e.g., 'C239') is ineffective for semantic search
  systems, as these IDs do not embed well.  Content-based queries that describe the subject matter
  are significantly more successful, highlighting the need for semantic understanding over literal
  matching.
insights:
  - >-
    Literal identifiers like 'C239' are poor search terms because they lack semantic meaning for
    embedding models.
  - >-
    Content-based queries (e.g., 'What is the core insight?') are far more effective at retrieving
    relevant information by matching semantic concepts.
  - >-
    Search systems prioritize semantic understanding over exact keyword matching, meaning phrasing
    and conceptual description are critical for findability.
  - >-
    The effectiveness of search is determined by query phrasing and the semantic richness of the
    query, not solely by the coverage of the knowledge base.
  - >-
    Metadata enhancement (aliases, titles) and specialized ID retrieval logic can improve the
    findability of specific knowledge units.
  - >-
    Honesty and admitting limitations (e.g., not finding a result) are crucial for maintaining trust
    and the integrity of a truth-testing system.
  - >-
    Coverage (e.g., 99.3%) does not guarantee findability; semantic search is inherently
    probabilistic and context-dependent.
