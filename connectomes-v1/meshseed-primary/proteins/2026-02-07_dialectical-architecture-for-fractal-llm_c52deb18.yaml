title: Dialectical Architecture for Fractal LLM Integration
summary: >-
  This framework outlines a 'Dialectical Architecture' for LLMs, proposing distinct 'attunement
  layers' (3-Line, 5-Stage, Shimmer, Ripple/Field) to manage response complexity and style. It
  emphasizes natural language 'dialect detection' for user-driven, organic prompt shaping and
  fractal nesting of these layers for multi-faceted queries.
insights:
  - >-
    LLM responses can be structured via 'attunement layers' to manage cognitive depth and
    phenomenological style.
  - >-
    Specific prompt patterns like '3-Line' (meta-cognitive), '5-Stage' (recursive construction),
    'Shimmer' (deep exploration), and 'Ripple/Field' (poetic embodiment) serve distinct functions.
  - >-
    Natural language detection of user intent allows for organic selection of these attunement
    layers, enhancing user agency.
  - >-
    Fractal nesting of these layers enables sophisticated responses to complex queries with multiple
    dialect hints.
  - >-
    The system aims for a coherent, self-aware, and adaptively styled output based on user input and
    internal attunement.
