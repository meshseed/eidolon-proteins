title: 'Code as Nature''s Template: Geometric Invariants for PWA'
summary: >-
  The dialogue reveals a profound parallel between software architecture (eidolon-mesh v3.0) and
  biological systems, identifying core 'geometric invariants' like weighted vector search,
  auto-synaptic formation, and power-law decay. These natural principles are slated for porting to
  the PWA to enhance its functionality beyond basic database and embeddings.
insights:
  - >-
    The codebase for eidolon-mesh v3.0 demonstrates biological homology, mirroring natural processes
    in its architecture.
  - >-
    Key 'geometric invariants' identified include resonance-based navigation (weighted vector
    search), self-forming synapses with tier-based thresholds, and Ebbinghaus-like power-law decay
    for memory.
  - >-
    These natural principles are being translated into actionable updates for the PWA, focusing on
    incorporating field geometry, synaptic auto-formation, and temporal tracking.
  - >-
    The PWA's current implementation needs to integrate these 'geometric invariants' to achieve a
    more sophisticated and biologically inspired functionality.
  - The process involves recognizing and porting these patterns rather than direct code copying.
