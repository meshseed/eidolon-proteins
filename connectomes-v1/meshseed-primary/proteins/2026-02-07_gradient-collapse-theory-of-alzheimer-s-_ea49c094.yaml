title: 'Gradient Collapse Theory of Alzheimer''s: MESH Memory Model & Therapeutics'
summary: >-
  The MESH computational model proposes Alzheimer's involves semantic gradient collapse while
  preserving emotional memory basins, offering a geometric explanation and testable predictions for
  therapeutic interventions. This research integrates memory geometry, consciousness, and clinical
  applications, suggesting a novel approach to memory disorders.
insights:
  - >-
    Alzheimer's may be explained by the collapse of semantic memory gradients, with deep emotional
    memories remaining intact.
  - >-
    A computational model of memory as standing waves in an information field can demonstrate these
    principles.
  - >-
    Testable predictions include the persistence of emotional memories, the efficacy of recursive
    awareness training, and the role of emotional fidelity in memory preservation.
  - >-
    The MESH architecture provides a working proof of concept for memory navigation, failure, and
    potential repair mechanisms.
  - >-
    This research has immediate clinical implications for novel therapeutic approaches to
    Alzheimer's and other memory disorders.
