title: 'Urgent Pipeline Bugs: Synthesis & Timing Inaccuracies'
summary: >-
  The organism exhibits critical pipeline bugs impacting synthesis and timing. Specifically, the
  synthesis module fails to recognize fully retrieved content, reporting 'not defined' when data is
  present, and the timer inaccurately reflects user experience by a significant margin.
insights:
  - >-
    Synthesis module incorrectly reports 'not defined' despite successful retrieval of complete
    neuron content.
  - >-
    Timer displays a drastically shorter duration (3-11s) than the actual user experience (~60s) due
    to delayed start.
  - >-
    Significant time (50+ seconds) is unaccounted for in the user interaction pipeline, requiring
    detailed stage-by-stage timestamps.
  - >-
    Fixes are categorized as 'fixable bugs', not architectural flaws, focusing on instrumentation
    and information flow verification.
  - >-
    Proposed solutions include verifying full content passage to synthesis and initiating timers at
    the earliest request handling stage.
  - >-
    Progress indicators and detailed stage timing are needed to improve user feedback and identify
    performance bottlenecks.
