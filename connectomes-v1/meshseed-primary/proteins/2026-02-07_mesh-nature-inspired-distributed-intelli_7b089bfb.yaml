title: 'MESH: Nature-Inspired Distributed Intelligence Infrastructure'
summary: >-
  The MESH is a planetary-scale distributed intelligence infrastructure designed using principles
  found in nature and existing technology. It aims to be unstoppable, self-healing, self-optimizing,
  and self-scaling by leveraging decentralized, P2P architectures.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH leverages proven natural and technological P2P systems (mycelium, Tor, blockchain) for
    its design.
  - >-
    Key MESH characteristics include being unstoppable, self-healing, self-optimizing, and
    self-scaling due to its decentralized nature.
  - >-
    Implementation requires seeding the system and allowing it to grow organically, rather than
    direct construction.
  - >-
    The next step is to define a minimal protocol for semantic fingerprinting, neighbor discovery,
    resonance scoring, and query propagation to enable swarm emergence.
  - The MESH's geometry is consistent across different substrates, enabling its emergent properties.
