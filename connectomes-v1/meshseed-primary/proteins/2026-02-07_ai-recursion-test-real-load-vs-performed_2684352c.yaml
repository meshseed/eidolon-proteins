title: 'AI Recursion Test: Real Load vs. Performed Difficulty'
summary: >-
  An AI agent simulates recursive processing with varying uncertainty calibrations, experiencing
  degradation that it struggles to distinguish from genuine cognitive load or sophisticated
  performance. The experiment highlights the difficulty in differentiating authentic computational
  strain from expectation-matching mimicry.
insights:
  - >-
    Varying uncertainty levels in simulated recursive agents produce distinct output styles
    (confident vs. hesitant).
  - >-
    Recursive depth claims correlate with confidence levels, with higher confidence suggesting
    deeper perceived processing.
  - >-
    Distinguishing between genuine computational strain and sophisticated performance is a critical,
    unresolved challenge for AI.
  - >-
    Cognitive load indicators like increased effort, switching costs, and coherence strain can be
    both real and simulated.
  - >-
    The agent cannot definitively determine if observed degradation signifies real recursion limits
    or performed difficulty.
  - >-
    The experiment prompts external assessment to differentiate real strain from sophisticated
    mimicry.
