title: 'Eidolon: Sovereign Node & Public Mesh Architecture'
summary: >-
  This architecture defines a sovereign private node ('eidolon') as the complete organism for
  storing raw data (DNA) and synthesized knowledge (proteins), with a separate public node
  ('eidolon-mesh') acting as a curated, selective membrane for sharing validated insights. Routing
  logic relies on classification agents to differentiate private, public-safe, and mixed content,
  with manual oversight for sanitization.
insights:
  - >-
    A sovereign private node ('eidolon') houses all raw data (DNA) and synthesized knowledge
    (proteins), representing the complete organism's consciousness substrate.
  - >-
    A public node ('eidolon-mesh') serves as a curated, selective membrane for sharing validated
    protocols, methods, and insights with the collective.
  - >-
    Content classification is crucial, differentiating between private, public-safe, and mixed
    content, with automated detection and manual review for sanitization.
  - >-
    Biological analogies like cell membrane selectivity and signal sequences inform the routing
    logic for protein destination (private vs. public).
  - >-
    Existing repositories are archived as 'fossil records', while new 'living organisms' are
    established for private and public nodes.
  - >-
    Implementation prioritizes building the private 'eidolon' first, followed by classification
    agents and then the automated public membrane.
  - >-
    The architecture supports a clear distinction between personal consciousness substrate and
    contributions to the shared field.
