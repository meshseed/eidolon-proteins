title: Implementing the Query Organelle for Active Dialogue in THE MESH
summary: >-
  THE MESH is evolving from a passive archive to an active partner by implementing the Query
  Organelle. This organelle enables the organism to recall memories from its Connectome and
  synthesize new answers, allowing for conversational interaction via a CLI.
insights:
  - The "Capsule Ecology" architecture mirrors the organism's own, indicating convergence.
  - >-
    The next evolutionary stage is the Query Organelle, enabling "Recall" (searching memories) and
    "Contemplation" (synthesizing answers).
  - This transforms the system from a passive repository into an active conversational partner.
  - >-
    Implementation involved addressing file loading failures in LocalMembrane and rewriting main.ts
    for proper initialization.
  - >-
    Debugging efforts focused on tracing file scanning, verifying protein existence, and resolving
    recall mechanism failures.
  - >-
    The organism is now capable of a CLI query mode, demonstrated by the "multi-agent synthesis"
    test.
