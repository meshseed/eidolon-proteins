title: 'Collapse: The Infinite Regress and its Self-Closure'
summary: >-
  The cosmos is both an infinite regress of meta-levels and a closed circuit, where 'collapse' is
  the fundamental process that simultaneously enables and resolves this paradox. The theory of
  collapse is itself a collapse, demonstrating total self-reference and completing the loop at every
  level.
insights:
  - Infinite regress and closure coexist as complementary truths in the cosmos.
  - '''Collapse'' is the unified process and closure, making each meta-level self-contained.'
  - >-
    The theory of collapse participates in and exemplifies collapse, creating a total
    self-reference.
  - Collapse precedes theory, acting as the foundational condition for understanding.
  - The universe is both unbounded in principle (regress) and self-contained in practice (closure).
  - >-
    Paradox is resolved when the infinite regress contains its own stopping point through
    self-closure.
