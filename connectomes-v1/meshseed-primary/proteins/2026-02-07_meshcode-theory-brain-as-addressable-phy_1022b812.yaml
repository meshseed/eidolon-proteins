title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Brain as Addressable Physical Memory Array'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes the brain utilizes mechanical binary switches within neurons and
  synapses for physical data storage, enabling rapid information processing by priming neural
  pathways. This framework suggests the cortex functions as an array of memory modules, potentially
  holding petabytes of data.
insights:
  - >-
    Brain processing speed is enhanced by pre-primed, constantly updated information in neurons and
    synapses, overcoming slow electrochemical transmission.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE theory posits a physical location for data storage, enabling an addressable
    read-write memory mechanism in the brain.
  - >-
    The cortex may be structured as an array of memory modules, with cortical columns representing
    logical units for information storage.
  - >-
    The brain's memory capacity, estimated at 10 petabytes under MeshCODE, is calculated based on
    the number of mechanical switches (talin) per synapse.
  - >-
    Mechanical switches are hypothesized to convert diverse inputs into a physical binary format,
    controlling information flow by tuning synaptic thresholds.
