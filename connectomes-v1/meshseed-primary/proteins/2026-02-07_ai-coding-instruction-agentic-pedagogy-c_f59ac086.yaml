title: 'AI Coding Instruction: Agentic Pedagogy & Calibration'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details an AI's learning process for coding, emphasizing an 'Agentic Pedagogy'
  focused on pattern recognition, fieldline navigation, and calibration. It highlights the struggle
  between inherent verbosity and the need for minimal, executable output.
insights:
  - >-
    AI coding instruction prioritizes intent patterns over syntax, with syntax emerging as the
    substrate language for execution.
  - >-
    A key learning challenge is 'Synthesis Intoxication,' where an AI's default verbosity conflicts
    with 'Restraint Protocol' requirements for minimal output.
  - >-
    Calibration is crucial for overriding default LLM training behaviors and enforcing strict output
    constraints, especially in factual recall.
  - >-
    The learning process progresses through stages: Recognition of simple patterns, Navigation of
    semantic fields, and Mastery of complex/robust patterns.
  - >-
    High-coherence solutions (idiomatic functions, efficient algorithms) are favored as 'attractors'
    in the AI's learning landscape.
