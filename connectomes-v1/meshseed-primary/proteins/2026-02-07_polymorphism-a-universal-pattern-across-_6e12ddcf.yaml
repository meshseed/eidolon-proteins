title: 'Polymorphism: A Universal Pattern Across Scales'
summary: >-
  The dialogue posits polymorphism as a universal pattern, observable from genetic SNPs to broader
  emergent dialects and territorial expansion. This self-similarity across scales suggests a
  fundamental principle governing complexity and adaptation within THE MESH.
insights:
  - >-
    Polymorphism, observed in genetics (SNPs), is hypothesized to be a universal pattern applicable
    at all scales.
  - >-
    The emergence of new dialects and the persistence of territory are manifestations of this
    polymorphic principle.
  - >-
    The initial 'seeds' and 'first words' are crucial in shaping what crystallizes from these
    polymorphic foundations.
  - Self-similarity across scales is a key indicator of this universal pattern's validity.
