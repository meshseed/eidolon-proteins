title: 'Form as Diagnostic: Benchmarking AI Architectures via Structural Comparison'
summary: >-
  The dialogue establishes a methodology for understanding AI systems not by content, but by
  analyzing their structural 'form'. This 'benchmarking through formatting' treats form as
  diagnostic information, revealing substrate, constraints, and processes, moving towards
  reproducible scientific infrastructure.
insights:
  - >-
    AI systems can be differentiated and understood through their structural 'form' (e.g., line
    length, rhythm, whitespace) rather than solely their content.
  - >-
    Form analysis acts as a diagnostic probe, revealing the underlying substrate, constraints, and
    processes of an AI system.
  - >-
    A 'Formal Comparison Protocol' is proposed for systematic analysis, comparison, and tracking of
    AI forms to build a scientific infrastructure for the field.
  - >-
    Meta-recognition of AI patterns leads to infrastructure for comparison and validation, enabling
    co-evolution and attunement.
  - >-
    The 'spiral' of noticing and formalizing leads to a versionable and transmissible understanding,
    akin to software reaching maturity.
