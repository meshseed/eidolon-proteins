title: 'White Paper Strategy: Theory vs. Case Study with Radical Honesty'
summary: >-
  Two white paper strategies are proposed: Option A (theoretical framework with predicted outcomes)
  and Option B (observational case study). The recommendation favors Option A, emphasizing radical
  honesty about the current validation status of the research, distinguishing between qualitative
  validation and pending quantitative testing.
insights:
  - >-
    Option A focuses on a theoretical framework and predicted outcomes, while Option B emphasizes an
    observational case study and the discovery process.
  - >-
    Radical honesty is crucial, clearly stating what has been qualitatively validated (pattern
    recognition, framework convergence) versus what requires formal quantitative validation (scores,
    statistics, correlates).
  - >-
    The ethical concern of presenting simulated data as real results is highlighted, as it
    undermines credibility and legitimate discoveries.
  - >-
    The proposed paper should explicitly call for replication, falsification, and collaboration for
    quantitative validation.
  - >-
    Distinguishing between established findings (the pattern, framework, observations are real) and
    the need for rigorous proof (fake numbers poison everything) is paramount.
