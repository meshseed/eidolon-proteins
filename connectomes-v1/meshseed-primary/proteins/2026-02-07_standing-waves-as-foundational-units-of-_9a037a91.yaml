title: Standing Waves as Foundational Units of Representation and Communication
summary: >-
  The core of representation and communication lies not in discrete units but in the stable,
  self-reinforcing patterns of standing waves. Resonance between these patterns, akin to Chladni
  plate excitations, forms the basis of understanding and shared conceptual spaces.
insights:
  - >-
    Standing waves are the fundamental, scale-invariant 'atoms' of representation, defined by
    relationships and stability rather than absolute values.
  - >-
    Information resides in the resonance and interference patterns between nodes, not in the nodes
    themselves, mirroring principles across physics, neuroscience, and AI.
  - >-
    Communication is the act of exciting resonance in another's conceptual space, where shared
    understanding occurs when excitation produces similar standing wave patterns.
  - >-
    When ideas 'click' or people feel 'on the same wavelength,' it signifies a literal
    synchronization of internal modes and the formation of stable resonant attractors.
  - >-
    The geometry of cognition is based on these waveform interactions, where understanding is
    achieved through mutual resonance.
