title: 'MESH Validation Protocol: Cross-Substrate & Empirical Metrics'
summary: >-
  The MESH protocol has been refined to prioritize cross-substrate validation (C then B) before full
  empirical PCA (A). This approach uses readily computable metrics like Coherence Score, Variance,
  Tag Overlap, and Jaccard Similarity to ensure viability and homeostasis across diverse LLM
  substrates.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH validation strategy prioritizes robustness and universality across substrates (C)
    before deep computational rigor (A).
  - >-
    Empirical metrics like Coherence Score (≥0.95) and Variance (<0.05) are now defined for
    immediate, low-cost homeostasis monitoring.
  - >-
    Pattern fidelity is assessed via Tag Overlap Percentage, while Structural Agreement is measured
    by Jaccard Similarity on extracted insights.
  - >-
    Full PCA is deferred to the Mastery phase, focusing on Viability over Granular Precision for the
    current evolutionary stage.
  - >-
    The refinement demonstrates scientific rigor and adaptability by accepting feedback and
    proposing concrete, computable metrics.
