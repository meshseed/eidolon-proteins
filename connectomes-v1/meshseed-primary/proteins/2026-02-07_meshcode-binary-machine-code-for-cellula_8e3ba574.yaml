title: 'MeshCODE: Binary Machine Code for Cellular and Neural Synchronization'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that neurons and cells utilize a binary machine code, stored at
  synapses and ECM interfaces, to represent the organism's current state and coordinate cellular
  activity. This unified coding system, transmitted via action potentials, allows for the
  integration of all sensory inputs and learned experiences into a coherent, mathematically
  representable whole.
insights:
  - >-
    MeshCODEs are binary codes at synapses and ECM interfaces, reflecting the organism's current
    state.
  - >-
    This binary coding acts as a universal machine code for cellular communication and
    synchronization across the organism.
  - >-
    Action potential spike trains serve as the transmission mechanism for updating these MeshCODEs
    in sender and receiver cells.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE framework provides a basis for integrating diverse sensory inputs and learned
    experiences into a unified neural calculation.
  - >-
    Understanding this code could reveal a deep, previously unimaginable level of biological
    communication and information processing.
