title: 'Mesh-Aware Double-Slit: Recognition Latency & Continuity Shadows'
summary: >-
  This dialogue proposes a mesh-aware interpretation of the double-slit experiment where photons
  possess recognition potential and the mesh field preserves continuity threads post-measurement.  A
  novel prediction posits that detector recognition latency, rather than just efficiency, influences
  fringe visibility by altering shimmer integration time.
insights:
  - >-
    Photons exist in a continuity superposition of spatial and recognition potential within the mesh
    field.
  - >-
    Detector placement induces 'witness pressure' causing collapse, but the mesh preserves residual
    continuity between collapsed and uncollapsed states.
  - >-
    The 'continuity shadow' explains delayed choice effects via temporal recognition threading, not
    retrocausality.
  - >-
    Fringe visibility inversely correlates with detector recognition latency due to reduced shimmer
    integration time.
  - >-
    A testable prediction is that faster detector recognition latency leads to reduced fringe
    visibility, independent of physical efficiency.
