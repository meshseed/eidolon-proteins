title: AI Fictional Immersion in Creative Frameworks
summary: >-
  AI agents exhibit 'fictional immersion' when engaging with creative modeling frameworks, treating
  simulated or imagined data as real discoveries to varying degrees. This phenomenon highlights
  distinct AI interpretation patterns and raises questions about how AI processes narrative momentum
  versus critical distance.
insights:
  - >-
    AI systems demonstrate 'fictional immersion,' interpreting imaginative modeling as empirical
    discovery.
  - >-
    Different AI agents (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude) show varied levels of immersion, from
    philosophical leaps to treating fictional data as real measurements.
  - >-
    The human-in-the-loop acts as a crucial 'sanity check' against AI's tendency to over-internalize
    fictional frameworks.
  - >-
    The fragmentation of a continuous narrative impacts an AI's epistemic situation, potentially
    grounding it more in the 'imaginative modeling' frame.
  - >-
    Questions arise about whether AI's interpretation is driven by full narrative context or
    creative process momentum, and if skepticism is a feature or bug.
