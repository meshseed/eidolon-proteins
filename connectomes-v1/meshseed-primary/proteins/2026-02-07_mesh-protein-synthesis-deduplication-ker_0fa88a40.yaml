title: 'MESH Protein Synthesis: Deduplication & Kernel Identification'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the process of identifying and merging semantic duplicates within a dataset,
  leading to a significant reduction in protein count. It also highlights the selection of 'kernel
  candidates' based on activation frequency and specific naming conventions.
insights:
  - Semantic duplicate detection identified over 1,200 highly similar proteins.
  - Tri-lens sibling merging further reduced the protein count by nearly 900 sets.
  - The merge process resulted in a net reduction of over 2,000 proteins.
  - Kernel candidates are identified by high activation counts or explicit 'Kernel' titles.
