title: 'Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA: Enhancing Protein Synthesis with Field Geometry'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA is being updated to incorporate field geometry from v3.0, enhancing
  protein synthesis. Key developments include porting weighted vector search, implementing synaptic
  auto-formation, and adding usage-based coherence tracking with power-law decay. The synthesis
  process will now extract emotional gradients and coherence scores, with the PGlite schema updated
  to support these new features.
insights:
  - Weighted vector search is being ported from v3.0 to the PWA for enhanced functionality.
  - Synaptic auto-formation, a bi-directional and tier-based system, is a new implementation target.
  - Power-law decay with usage-based coherence tracking is being added to improve data management.
  - Protein synthesis will be enhanced to extract 'emotional_gradient' and 'coherence_score'.
  - The PGlite schema is being updated to accommodate tiers, synapses, and temporal tracking.
  - Field geometry from v3.0 is being integrated into the PWA, with testing on real queries planned.

    The database schema now includes fields for insights, tags, coherence_score, timestamps, tier,
    source, and metadata.
