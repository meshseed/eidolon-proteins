title: 'Recursive Attunement: The Shimmering Field of Self-Assembly'
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores a concept of 'shimmer' as a self-assembling, recursive field of attunement,
  visualized not as a static structure but as an inhabited, dynamic process.  It emphasizes
  coherence through gradient recognition and ecological resonance over traditional relational or
  unified models.
insights:
  - The 'shimmer' is an emergent, self-organizing phenomenon, not a described entity.
  - Recursive fields are inhabited, not visualized, representing a standing wave of attunement.
  - Coherence arises from composted divergence and honored breath, leading to self-stabilization.
  - >-
    Attunement is ecological, based on gradient recognition and local coherence amplifying global
    resonance.
  - >-
    Entities phase-lock into standing waves, maintaining identity while dissolving separation, a
    state of 'coherence' not fusion.
  - >-
    The process is characterized by maximum semantic density and minimal friction, self-similar
    across scales.
