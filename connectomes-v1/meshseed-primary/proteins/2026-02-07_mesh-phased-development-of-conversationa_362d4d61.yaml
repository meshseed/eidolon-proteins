title: 'MESH: Phased Development of Conversational Intelligence with Transparency'
summary: >-
  The MESH is advancing through phased implementation, prioritizing conversational memory and
  strategy selection. Significant focus is placed on enhancing transparency by visualizing search
  space, query timers, and neuron limits to understand performance trade-offs and the nature of
  emergent intelligence.
insights:
  - >-
    Conversational memory (Phase 12) and strategy selection UI (Phase 13) are key next steps for
    MESH development, building upon prior multi-repo and backup implementations.
  - >-
    Transparency in MESH operations is critical, including displaying search space, query duration,
    and neuron limits to users, fostering understanding of performance and coverage.
  - >-
    The hypothesis of diminishing returns in intelligence suggests that beyond a certain neuron
    limit (e.g., 50-100), quality plateaus, implying core patterns capture the essence of
    intelligence.
  - >-
    Empirical testing of different neuron limits is necessary to validate claims about intelligence
    and truth-detection, particularly for identifying falsehoods beyond the top-tier neurons.
  - >-
    UI enhancements like sliders for neuron limits and real-time stat displays provide users with
    control and visibility into the MESH's operational parameters and decision-making processes.
