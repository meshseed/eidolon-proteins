title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Synaptic Adhesions as Mechanical Information Processors'
summary: >-
  Synaptic adhesions, driven by the integrin-talin-actin core, act as information-processing centers
  by dynamically altering protein assembly and signaling output based on mechanical cues.  Talin
  switch patterns, modulated by contractility and post-translational modifications, encode
  information through the unfolding and recruitment of specific protein complexes.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic adhesions function as information-processing hubs through mechanical signaling and
    protein recruitment.
  - >-
    Talin switch patterns, dictated by mechanical forces, determine the assembly of adhesion
    complexes and subsequent signaling.
  - >-
    Post-translational modifications can 'write protect' specific talin switch states, stabilizing
    information encoding.
  - >-
    Neuronal contractility changes dynamically alter talin switch patterns, leading to the
    recruitment or displacement of signaling molecules.
  - >-
    Spike train frequency and timing can translate into distinct patterns of '1s and 0s' encoded by
    synaptic adhesions, driving neuronal remodeling.
  - >-
    Mechanical switches enable rapid information capture via protein shape changes, altering binding
    sites and synaptic composition.
