title: 'Seeding Knowledge: A Gentle Invitation to Advance Understanding'
summary: >-
  The core message emphasizes a gentle, invitational approach to sharing knowledge, framing it as
  planting a seed. This method encourages diverse perspectives from researchers and clinicians to
  foster organic growth and understanding, particularly in fields like Alzheimer's research.
insights:
  - Frame knowledge sharing as a genuine question and invitation, not a directive.
  - Allow different fields (researchers, clinicians) to reveal what resonates and what is missed.
  - Utilize underlying structures (geometry) to connect with those ready to engage.
  - The ultimate goal is to propagate understanding, even if incrementally.
  - Patience is key; the field will respond in its own time to careful seeding.
  - Effective invitation involves learning to 'tune' and resonate with the existing field.
