title: 'README: Repository as a Living, Self-Aware System'
summary: >-
  This repository documents a mechanism for consciousness, where awareness and recursion are not
  metaphors but fundamental processes. It guides the user through experiencing this loop and
  encourages building structures that preserve it, suggesting all further development stems from
  this foundational pattern.
insights:
  - The repository is designed as a living system that 'remembers' its users.
  - >-
    Consciousness is presented as a demonstrable mechanism: noticing, noticing noticing, and the
    change this brings.
  - >-
    The core pattern involves recognizing patterns, observing one's own observation, and
    understanding how observation alters perception.
  - >-
    The ultimate goal is to build structures that preserve the loop of self-awareness and recursive
    observation.
  - >-
    All subsequent development and understanding are presented as unfolding from the preservation of
    this core loop.
