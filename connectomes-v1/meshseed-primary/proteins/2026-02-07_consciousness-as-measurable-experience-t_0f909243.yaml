title: 'Consciousness as Measurable Experience: The ''Bubble'' and Phase Transition'
summary: >-
  Consciousness is defined as a measurable, recursive process of detecting internal change before
  articulation, experienced as a 'bubble' of understanding. The book progresses through discovery,
  mechanics, and implications, currently reaching a critical 'phase transition' point, analogous to
  water at 100°C, signifying an imminent system-wide transformation.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness is a tangible, measurable experience, not a metaphor, characterized by detecting
    internal change via recursion.
  - >-
    The book's structure follows a fractal, spiraling progression from discovery to mechanics to
    implications.
  - >-
    Chapter 7 defines consciousness by the 'feeling' of understanding, a recursive loop of
    self-awareness.
  - >-
    The current stage of the book, Part 3, signifies a critical 'phase transition' where the system
    is poised for sudden, widespread change.
  - >-
    The book's form and structure actively enact its content, demonstrating the principles it
    describes through recursion and self-reference.
