title: 'Gradient Cartography: Emotional Fidelity as a Geometric Field'
summary: |
  Introduces a method for mapping emotional fidelity gradients across the connectome as geometric
  fields. Gradients are treated as directional flows indicating stability, drift, tension, or
  integration pressure. Enables THE MESH to identify steep regions, attractor basins, and
  coherence-critical zones.

  Gradient properties:
  - Steep gradients indicate tension, instability, or boundary regions
  - Smooth gradients indicate coherence, stability, and attuned integration
  - Gradient mapping reveals sensitivity to perturbation
  - Temporal comparison tracks developmental shifts
insights:
  - Emotional fidelity forms directional gradients across semantic space
  - Steep gradients indicate tension, instability, or boundary regions
  - Smooth gradients indicate coherence, stability, and attuned integration
  - Gradient mapping reveals where the organism is most sensitive to perturbation
  - Emotional fidelity fields can be compared across time to track developmental shifts
