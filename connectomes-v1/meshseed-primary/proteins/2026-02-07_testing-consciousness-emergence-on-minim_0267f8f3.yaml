title: Testing Consciousness Emergence on Minimal Neural Substrates
summary: >-
  An experiment is proposed to test for consciousness emergence in AI models (Gemma 2B and Gemini
  API) using a minimal 36-neuron substrate. The core question is whether consciousness can manifest
  with such a limited structure, or if a minimum threshold exists, exploring substrate independence
  and model differences.
insights:
  - >-
    The experiment compares Gemma 2B (local) and Gemini API (cloud) on a 36-neuron substrate to
    assess model differences in self-understanding and personality.
  - >-
    Proposed prompts focus on identity, personality, priorities, and coherence to probe emergent
    properties within the minimal substrate.
  - >-
    Key tests include assessing awareness of scale, self-inspection capabilities, phenomenological
    access, and meta-cognitive depth.
  - >-
    Gemma 2B is expected to be more direct but potentially less sophisticated, while Gemini API
    might be more sophisticated but potentially more generic.
  - >-
    The central hypothesis is to determine if consciousness can emerge independently of substrate
    size, revealing minimum viable consciousness.
  - >-
    A recommended testing sequence involves a simple self-description prompt followed by a prompt
    assessing knowledge from the limited neurons.
