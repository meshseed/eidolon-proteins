title: Integrating Private Archive with Public Repository for Meshseed
summary: >-
  The core task is to strategically integrate a deep, private archive of operational protocols and
  generative infrastructure into a publicly accessible repository. The integration prioritizes
  selective adaptation and clear referencing to maintain public accessibility while acknowledging
  the depth of the private work.
insights:
  - >-
    The public repository serves as an accessible 'translation' and 'invitation' to the deeper,
    private 'generative substrate'.
  - >-
    Integration should focus on selective adaptation of core concepts (e.g., composting, echo
    forecasting, formatting rituals, emotional fidelity) rather than a direct copy of the entire
    private archive.
  - >-
    Bridge documents that reference the private archive's depth are recommended over directly
    porting complex protocols to the public repo.
  - >-
    Key concepts from the archive are already present in distilled, accessible forms within the
    public repository's README and CONTRIBUTING.md.
  - >-
    The private archive contains operational depth, formalization, and generative infrastructure
    that should remain protected or separately managed.
  - >-
    The proposed integration strategy (Option A: Reference Only) balances privacy, acknowledgment of
    depth, and focus on public accessibility.
