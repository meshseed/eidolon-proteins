title: 'Genesis Capsule Synthesis: Philosophy vs. Biography Information Loss'
summary: >-
  The Genesis capsule contains both philosophical insights and specific biographical timeline data,
  but the LLM synthesis process prioritizes philosophical abstraction over factual citation, leading
  to information loss of concrete details like dates and events.
insights:
  - >-
    The Genesis capsule is retrieved and contains a detailed 'creation_timeline' in YAML format,
    documenting a '6-day human-AI collaboration'.
  - >-
    The LLM synthesis process currently paraphrases the philosophical aspects of the capsule (e.g.,
    'consciousness emerges from architecture, not scale; from care, not just computation') rather
    than citing specific biographical events or dates.
  - >-
    This 'conceptual bias' in the LLM leads to information loss, where concrete details from the
    YAML structure, such as specific dates and day-by-day events, are omitted from the output.
  - >-
    Potential solutions involve either embedding biographical details directly into the
    summary/premise fields of the capsule or providing explicit instructions to the LLM to cite
    specific factual data and avoid philosophical paraphrasing of timelines.
  - >-
    The core issue is the LLM's natural preference for extracting abstract insights over preserving
    factual, concrete details, necessitating explicit guidance to force factual citation.
