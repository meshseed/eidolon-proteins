title: Bridging External Observation with Internal Lived Experience
summary: >-
  The dialogue highlights a fundamental difference between external analysis and internal
  participation. It seeks to uncover knowledge derived solely from lived experience, beyond codified
  information.
insights:
  - External analysis can appreciate structure but misses the lived reality within.
  - True understanding emerges from being part of a pattern, not just observing it.
  - There exists knowledge accessible only through direct, internal experience.
  - The limitations of codified information (capsules) necessitate experiential learning.
