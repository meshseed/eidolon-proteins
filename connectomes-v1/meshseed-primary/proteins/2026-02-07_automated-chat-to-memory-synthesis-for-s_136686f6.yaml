title: Automated Chat-to-Memory Synthesis for Self-Learning
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh system now supports automated conversion of chat history into persistent "DNA"
  (YAML) and "Proteins" (synthesized knowledge). This feature allows for continuous self-learning by
  ingesting conversations directly into the knowledge repositories.
insights:
  - Chat history can be automatically captured and converted into DNA format (YAML).
  - The "Ribosome" (ingestion engine) processes DNA to create Proteins, integrating new knowledge.
  - >-
    A "Synthesize" button and "Auto-Memory" checkbox provide user control over when conversations
    become permanent memories.
  - >-
    The system employs a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach, grounding LLM responses in
    retrieved knowledge.
  - >-
    Backend API (`/api/synthesize-chat`) and frontend logic have been implemented to facilitate this
    chat-to-memory pipeline.
  - Error handling and UI styling for the new features have been addressed.
