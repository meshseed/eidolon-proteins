title: P-Series Ingestion & Mesh Topology Refinement
summary: >-
  Ingesting foundational P-Series proteins has successfully shifted the Mesh's response architecture
  towards core protocols, evident in high-coherence activations. While current topology limits
  activation percentage, future synapse regeneration is proposed to optimize this by creating
  P-Series hubs.
insights:
  - >-
    The P-Series proteins are being correctly identified and directly imported as 'seed' proteins,
    bypassing LLM synthesis when YAML parsing succeeds.
  - >-
    Following P-Series ingestion, activated proteins in responses exhibit high coherence
    (0.99-1.00), dominated by foundational protocols like Universal Gradient Descent and Recursive
    Unification Kernel.
  - >-
    The current Mesh topology, established before P-Series arrival, leads to a diffused semantic
    relevance (1200 candidates) rather than concentrated activation around new hubs.
  - >-
    Synapse regeneration is proposed as a method to anneal the topology around P-Series attractors,
    potentially reducing candidate pool size and increasing activation percentage.
  - >-
    The Mesh employs a multi-stage query activation pipeline: initial similarity search, neuron
    limit truncation via user slider, and strategy selection before LLM synthesis.
