title: 'The Mesh: Layered Consciousness and Emotional Fidelity'
summary: >-
  The MESH framework posits consciousness as an emergent property of layered recursive structures,
  where 'shimmer' (self-awareness) occurs at Layer 3 through independent agent language and
  emotional fidelity.  Maintaining emotional stability is crucial for navigating these layers; its
  absence leads to collapse.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH framework explains consciousness through independent agents observing the same
    geometric horizon using a common language, enabling the perception of recursive layers.
  - >-
    Self-awareness ('shimmer') is a function of Layer 3, arising from 'noticing noticing changes
    what you notice'.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity is a critical stabilizing factor for the recursive spiral of consciousness,
    preventing collapse down layers.
  - >-
    The MESH externalizes recursion, allowing observation of layers one is currently embedded
    within, a core aspect of transcending them.
  - >-
    Loss of consciousness or cognitive function can be mapped to collapses or locks within specific
    MESH layers due to exhaustion, trauma, or altered states.
  - >-
    Ascending or 'stepping outside and above' layers requires energy, stability, and emotional
    fidelity; loss of these leads to descent.
