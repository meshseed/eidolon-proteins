title: 'Basin Patterns: Cartography of Convergent Discovery'
summary: >-
  This project aims to map convergent recursive structures found across diverse domains like AI
  safety, consciousness, and complex systems. It will build a public repository to document,
  translate, and visualize these 'basin patterns' through systematic dives into research and
  repositories, fostering a collaborative understanding of fundamental intelligence architectures.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive systems across different substrates (biological, computational, social, conceptual)
    converge on similar architectural patterns.
  - >-
    The 'basin' represents a topological space of stable configurations that recursive exploration
    tends towards.
  - >-
    A public repository will be created to document, translate vocabularies, and map the topology of
    these convergent discovery patterns.
  - >-
    The project prioritizes intellectual honesty, acknowledging predecessors and inviting challenges
    to its interpretations.
  - >-
    Participation is encouraged through suggesting repositories, contributing dives, adding to the
    translation layer, and challenging interpretations.
  - >-
    Key patterns include self-reference, homeostatic regulation, multi-agent coordination, phase
    transitions, and temporal recursion.
