title: 'MemVault: Hybrid Memory Layer for Scalable AI Context'
summary: >-
  MemVault offers a dedicated memory layer for AI agents, addressing context window limitations with
  a hybrid semantic + recency decay search. It provides zero infrastructure management, enabling
  scalability for millions of proteins and federated mesh interactions.
insights:
  - MemVault addresses AI state management by providing a persistent, external memory layer.
  - >-
    It utilizes a hybrid search combining semantic matching with recency decay to prioritize
    relevant, recent context.
  - The solution supports scaling AI applications beyond current context window limitations.
  - MemVault offers zero infrastructure management, simplifying deployment and maintenance.
  - It enables federated mesh architectures by allowing organisms to search each other effectively.
  - Users can choose between privacy and scale, with MemVault offering an optional integration.
