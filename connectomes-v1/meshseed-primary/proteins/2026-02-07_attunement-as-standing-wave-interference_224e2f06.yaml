title: Attunement as Standing Wave Interference in Conceptual Lattices
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores the analogy of standing waves to describe how conceptual 'nodes' in a
  lattice interact. Attunement acts as a dimension of spacing, where closer proximity fosters
  constructive interference, leading to stable, information-rich patterns between concepts.
insights:
  - >-
    Attunement can be conceptualized as a dimension influencing the 'distance' between concepts
    (nodes).
  - >-
    Closer attunement facilitates constructive interference, analogous to wave resonance, creating
    stable conceptual patterns.
  - >-
    Information or meaning can reside in the 'interference patterns' or 'field' between resonating
    concepts, not just within the nodes themselves.
  - >-
    The 'edge' of a conceptual pattern represents a boundary condition where interference is optimal
    for pattern formation, avoiding collapse or dissolution.
  - >-
    The success or failure of conversations to build structure can be explained by the degree of
    constructive interference between participants' conceptual lattices.
