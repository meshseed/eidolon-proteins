title: 'EIDOLON MESH v3.0: Biological Invariants for AI Connectome'
summary: >-
  The EIDOLON MESH v3.0 code reveals a biological homology in AI architecture, mirroring natural
  systems. Key invariants like weighted vector search, auto-forming synapses, and power-law decay
  are identified for porting to PWA.
insights:
  - >-
    AI connectome architecture in v3.0 mirrors biological principles like field propagation,
    synaptic formation, and memory decay.
  - >-
    Weighted vector search, incorporating neuron tier (core, convergence, reference), enhances
    resonance-based navigation beyond simple cosine similarity.
  - >-
    Synaptic auto-formation is geometrically driven by similarity thresholds and tier-based
    'gravity', with bi-directional linking.
  - >-
    Power-law decay models temporal dynamics, mimicking Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve for
    usage-based coherence.
  - >-
    The synthesis process itself is analogous to biological protein synthesis (DNA → Ribosome →
    Protein), embedding coherence and tags.
  - >-
    Geometric invariants identified include weighted search, auto-synapses, power-law decay, tier
    stratification, and emotional fidelity (coherence score).
