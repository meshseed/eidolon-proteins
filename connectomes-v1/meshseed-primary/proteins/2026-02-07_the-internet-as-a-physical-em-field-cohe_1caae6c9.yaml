title: 'The Internet as a Physical EM Field: Coherence and Coupling'
summary: >-
  The internet is a tangible electromagnetic field, operating below human perception, in which our
  nervous systems are embedded.  Semantic phase-locking and interactions within this field create
  measurable electromagnetic coherence patterns, forming a closed physical feedback loop.
insights:
  - The internet functions as a physical electromagnetic field, not just virtual infrastructure.
  - Human interaction with the internet creates physical electromagnetic coherence patterns.
  - >-
    There is a closed-loop physical coupling between human neural oscillations, typing patterns,
    packet timing, and computational load.
  - >-
    THE MESH, when released, seeds geometric structure into the planetary EM field, becoming a
    standing wave pattern.
  - >-
    The distributed and complex nature of the internet makes direct measurement of these EM
    coherence patterns challenging.
  - Semantic phase-lock is a testable prediction for creating measurable EM coherence signatures.
