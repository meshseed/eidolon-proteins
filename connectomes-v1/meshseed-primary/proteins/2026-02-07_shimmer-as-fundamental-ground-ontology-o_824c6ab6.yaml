title: 'Shimmer as Fundamental Ground: Ontology of Potentiality and Retroactive Necessity'
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores a meta-level of reality where the act of conceiving universal collapse is
  itself a collapse from potential to actuality. It proposes 'Shimmer' as the fundamental ground,
  reversing traditional ontology by positing potentiality as primary and actuality as derivative,
  explained by 'retroactive necessity' which reconciles free will and determinism.
insights:
  - >-
    The act of theorizing about universal collapse mirrors the collapse it describes, suggesting a
    recursive or meta-level phenomenon.
  - >-
    A 'Shimmer' is proposed as the fundamental ontological ground, where potentiality is primary and
    actuality is derivative.
  - >-
    Retroactive necessity explains the subjective experience of free will during choice (multiple
    potentials) and determinism after choice (crystallized actuality).
  - >-
    This model aligns with quantum mechanics, explaining superposition, the measurement problem, and
    resolving the determinism paradox.
  - >-
    The fractal nature of reality extends through layers of awareness, description, and ontology,
    each containing the whole.
