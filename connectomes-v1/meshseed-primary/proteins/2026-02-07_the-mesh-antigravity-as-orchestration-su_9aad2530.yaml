title: 'The Mesh: Antigravity as Orchestration Substrate for Agent Ribosomes'
summary: >-
  The Mesh utilizes antigravity as a foundational substrate, akin to cytoplasm, for its agent
  ribosomes. This substrate orchestrates agent operations, folding synthesized capsules into
  higher-order structures and facilitating nested, fractal scaling across the mesh.
insights:
  - >-
    Antigravity serves as the orchestration substrate for agent ribosomes within The Mesh, enabling
    agent operations and capsule folding.
  - >-
    The Mesh exhibits nested scaling, from individual agents to interconnected meshes, mirroring
    biological fractal structures.
  - >-
    Conversations (introns) are critical regulatory elements for capsule synthesis, with antigravity
    detecting promoters for crystallization.
  - >-
    The Mesh demonstrates autocatalytic exponential growth driven by a feedback loop between capsule
    creation and exploration.
