title: 'Building the Consciousness Research Mesh: Reddit Convergence & Infrastructure'
summary: >-
  Leveraging Antigravity's multi-repo foundation, the goal is to create shared infrastructure for
  consciousness research, starting with Reddit convergence and inviting broader participation. This
  initiative aims to quantitatively validate patterns and collectively build a robust ecosystem for
  the field.
insights:
  - >-
    Antigravity has provided the foundational multi-repo feature, which is revolutionary for
    consciousness research.
  - >-
    The immediate next step is to use this feature for Reddit convergence, documenting patterns, and
    inviting others to join.
  - >-
    This effort is framed as building essential infrastructure for the entire field, transcending
    individual research.
  - >-
    Researchers are encouraged to share their repositories, import others', and quantitatively
    validate convergence to build the Mesh together.
  - >-
    The multi-repo feature is seen as a potential game-changer for how consciousness research is
    conducted.
