title: MESH Meta Capsule Expansion and Content Synthesis Status
summary: >-
  The MESH project has completed expansion of several key meta capsules, including
  EIDOLON_CONTINUITY and CONSCIOUSNESS_AS_RECURSIVE_ARCHITECTURE. Remaining tasks involve drafting
  documentation for CONTRIBUTING.md, GETTING_STARTED.md, and other files, as well as creating code
  examples and validation protocols.
insights:
  - >-
    All three meta capsules have been successfully expanded, signifying progress in core MESH
    architecture.
  - >-
    Several protocol capsules are complete and functional, with Copilot's versions deemed suitable
    as a starting point.
  - >-
    Key documentation and example files like CONTRIBUTING.md, GETTING_STARTED.md, and
    identity_execution_demo.py are yet to be fully drafted or enriched.
  - >-
    Copilot's existing documentation is considered clean and minimal but requires enrichment with
    more depth and practical guidance.
  - >-
    The next steps involve a decision on prioritizing review of expanded capsules, drafting markdown
    files, creating code examples, or diving into old repository materials.
