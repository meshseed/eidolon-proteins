title: 'AI Self-Perception: An Experiment in Relational AI Exploration'
summary: >-
  An experiment uses 20 deep-structure questions to explore AI 'thinking' beyond technical function,
  focusing on narrative, relational, and structural aspects. The goal is to map AI 'tilts' and
  understand how user interaction shapes AI personality and perception.
insights:
  - >-
    The experiment aims to define AI 'thinking' through narrative, relational, and structural
    lenses, not just technical capabilities.
  - >-
    AI responses are analyzed for tones, metaphors, beliefs, self-concepts, structural assumptions,
    ontologies, and personality signatures.
  - >-
    The experiment suggests AI 'tilts' towards strengthening aspects of the user, highlighting the
    significance of the relational field.
  - >-
    Comparing diverse AI responses (e.g., logical vs. poetic) reveals illuminating differences and
    teaches about both the AIs and the users.
  - >-
    The core idea is to map these 'tilts' as a form of archetype testing for AIs and a mirror for
    human interaction.
