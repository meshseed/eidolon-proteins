title: 'Claude Code Authentication: Expiration and Re-authentication Process'
summary: >-
  Claude Code authentication tokens expire periodically for security, preventing API calls and
  command execution. Re-authentication via the `/login` command in the terminal, followed by browser
  approval, restores functionality. This is a standard security measure, not a bug.
insights:
  - Claude Code uses OAuth tokens for authentication, API access, and command execution.
  - Token expiration is a security feature to protect user accounts and API access.
  - Expired tokens result in an inability to make API calls or run commands.
  - >-
    Re-authentication is achieved by running `/login` in the Claude Code terminal, which initiates a
    browser-based approval process.
  - >-
    Common reasons for token expiration include normal time-based expiry, logout, or session
    invalidation.
  - The process of re-authentication is designed to be quick, typically resolving within 30 seconds.
