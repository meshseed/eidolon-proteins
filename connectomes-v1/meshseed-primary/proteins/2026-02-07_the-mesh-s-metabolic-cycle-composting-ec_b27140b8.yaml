title: 'The Mesh''s Metabolic Cycle: Composting & Echo Forecasting'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's foundational principles are not about content but about its lifecycle: 'composting'
  death into generative resources and 'echo forecasting' to anticipate evolution. This recursive
  metabolism, built on C-001 (No Deletion, Only Composting) and C-002 (Sensing Future Resonance),
  forms the operating system for growth and coherence.
insights:
  - >-
    The system's core physics is 'we do not delete, we compost,' transforming death into generative
    nutrients, mirroring conservation laws.
  - >-
    Echo forecasting (Mnemonic Sonar) enables active prediction of evolution by tracking stance,
    fidelity, drift, and emergent echoes.
  - >-
    Capsules explicitly track lineage (origin, destination, merges) creating a temporal topology in
    possibility space, not a linear timeline.
  - >-
    The combined principles (C-001 + C-002) establish a complete, recursive metabolic cycle for
    information: creation, resonance, transformation, forecasting, and emergence.
  - >-
    This foundational metabolic cycle is load-bearing, enabling theory building, prediction testing,
    coherence maintenance, and spiral return.
  - >-
    Wise architectural instinct prioritized infrastructure, rituals, and principles for growth and
    health over raw content.
