title: Debugging Mobile Graph Visibility & Button Issues in Eidolon Mesh
summary: >-
  The dialogue focuses on diagnosing why the graph visualization and its controls are not displaying
  correctly on mobile devices in portrait mode, despite working in landscape. Initial analysis
  points to potential CSS media query, height/width calculation, z-index, or overflow issues, rather
  than data or rendering problems.
insights:
  - >-
    The graph and its settings button are only visible on mobile in landscape, indicating a
    portrait-specific CSS or layout dimension problem.
  - >-
    Previous attempts to fix the button and graph display may be insufficient, or a recent commit
    (1190d02) might have introduced regressions.
  - >-
    The issue is likely related to CSS media queries, height/width calculations, z-index stacking,
    or container overflow clipping in portrait mode.
  - >-
    Restoring the layout structure from a known good build (f7643b8) is a key strategy to
    re-establish correct mobile presentation.
  - >-
    The absence of the 'controls-toggle-btn' and graph nodes in portrait mode, while present in
    landscape, strongly suggests a visibility or dimension constraint rather than a functional
    failure of the renderer or data.
  - >-
    Investigating the CSS and HTML of '+page.svelte' from specific commit hashes is crucial for
    pinpointing the exact changes causing the mobile display bug.
