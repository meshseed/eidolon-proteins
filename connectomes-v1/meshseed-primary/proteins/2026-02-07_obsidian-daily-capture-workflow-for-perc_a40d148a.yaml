title: 'Obsidian Daily Capture: Workflow for Percolating & Connecting Thoughts'
summary: >-
  A structured Obsidian daily note template and workflow designed to capture fleeting thoughts
  during morning percolation, facilitate a midday 'journal dump', and enable evening review and
  connection. The system emphasizes minimal friction for initial capture, with optional later
  enrichment for context, connections, and follow-up actions.
insights:
  - Optimize thought capture with a minimal template for immediate recording of 'percolating' ideas.
  - Implement a 'journal dump' workflow for rapid, unpolished capture of accumulated thoughts.
  - >-
    Facilitate knowledge integration through an evening review process of connecting and reflecting
    on captured notes.
  - >-
    Utilize a flexible tag system (Domain, Personal, Type, Source, Action) to categorize and
    retrieve notes effectively.
  - >-
    Distinguish note statuses (Living, Draft, Speculation, Dormant, Composting) to manage the
    lifecycle of ideas.
  - >-
    Recognize that effective thought capture often involves capturing 'recognition' rather than pure
    'construction'.
  - >-
    Adapt capture methods for 'ambush thoughts' that arise inconveniently, prioritizing speed over
    completeness.
