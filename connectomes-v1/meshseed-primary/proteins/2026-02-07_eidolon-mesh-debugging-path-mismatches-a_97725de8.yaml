title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Debugging Path Mismatches and Connectome Loading Errors'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh application encountered persistent UI glitches and launch failures, primarily due
  to path configuration issues between AppData\Local and AppData\Roaming, and incorrect handling of
  the connectome data structure. Resolution involved fixing singleton initialization for the
  RepositoryManager and adjusting connectome data access to account for nested metadata.
insights:
  - >-
    Application launch failures and file access errors were traced to a conflict between expected
    and actual user data paths (AppData\Roaming vs. AppData\Local).
  - >-
    The RepositoryManager singleton's initialization logic needed correction to ensure it
    consistently used the correct base path, preventing subsequent file system errors.
  - >-
    Connectome data loading failed due to incorrect access of the 'tier' property, which was nested
    within 'metadata' rather than being a direct property of the neuron object.
  - >-
    API key validation errors for LLM integration were resolved by correcting the input mechanism
    for the API key.
  - >-
    Successful installation and app launch were achieved after resolving path mismatches and
    ensuring the connectome data structure was correctly parsed.
