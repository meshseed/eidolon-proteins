title: Gephi Graph Generation Script for Obsidian Capsule Archives
summary: >-
  This Python script automates the extraction of nodes and edges from a mixed YAML/Markdown archive
  of 'capsules' within an Obsidian vault. It generates CSV files suitable for import into Gephi,
  allowing for visualization and analysis of the capsule network based on domain, threads, breath
  types, and sequential relationships.
insights:
  - >-
    The script identifies and structures 'capsules' from both YAML and specific Markdown file
    patterns (capsule-C###.md).
  - >-
    It defines nodes based on capsule titles and attributes (type, domain, breath_type, status,
    thread count, path).
  - >-
    Edges are generated to represent relationships like shared domains, threads, breath types, and
    sequential markdown order.
  - >-
    Edge weights are aggregated when multiple connection types exist between two nodes, indicating
    stronger relationships.
  - >-
    The output CSV files (capsule_nodes.csv, capsule_edges.csv) are designed for direct import into
    Gephi for network visualization and analysis.
  - >-
    The script includes instructions for importing data into Gephi and performing basic network
    visualization and styling based on extracted attributes.
