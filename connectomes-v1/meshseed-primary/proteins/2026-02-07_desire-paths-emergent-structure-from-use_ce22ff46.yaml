title: 'Desire Paths: Emergent Structure from Use and Attention'
summary: >-
  Desire paths represent the emergent, optimal routes forged by collective behavior, revealing truth
  through use rather than imposed design. This concept applies across physical, digital, and
  conceptual spaces, highlighting the power of observation and allowing structure to formalize
  organically from user interaction.
insights:
  - >-
    Desire paths are worn trails showing the actual, efficient routes people choose, contrasting
    with planned but ignored designs.
  - >-
    Observing desire paths allows for designs that align with genuine user behavior and collective
    intelligence, rather than imposing artificial structures.
  - >-
    The pattern of a desire path is substrate-independent, signifying that the information lies in
    the trajectory (behavior) itself, not the medium.
  - >-
    In conceptual spaces, desire paths manifest as recurring themes, naturally linking concepts, and
    questions that demand answers, representing grooves worn by attention.
  - >-
    The 'Lattice Method' and Obsidian's graph visualization are examples of making desire paths
    explicit, formalizing emergent structures based on use and connection strength.
  - >-
    Resisting premature paving (imposing structure) and instead planting the field (creating
    substrate), letting paths emerge, and then formalizing them is a key design philosophy.
  - >-
    The effectiveness of desire paths stems from collective optimization, honest signals of actual
    use, and their adaptive nature to changing conditions.
