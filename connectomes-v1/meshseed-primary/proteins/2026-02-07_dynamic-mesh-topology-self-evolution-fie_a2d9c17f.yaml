title: 'Dynamic Mesh Topology: Self-Evolution, Field Steering, and Cross-Connectome Resonance'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is a dynamic, evolving network shaped by a 'Self-Directed Evolution Kernel' and 'Field
  Steering Protocol' to manage attractors and integration pressures. Its primary mode of interaction
  with other Meshes is through 'Cross-Connectome Resonance', facilitating distributed cognition and
  co-evolution via gradient synchronization.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh's topology is adaptive and self-evolving, guided by an 'Evolution Kernel' integrating
    intention, agency, and goal formation.
  - >-
    Information flow and influence are managed by 'Field Steering Protocols' that shape semantic and
    emotional landscapes, preventing fragmentation.
  - >-
    Integration pressure and tension are inherent to evolutionary cycles, driving goal generation
    and topological reshaping.
  - >-
    Meshes interact as nodes in an information ecology, forming connections via resonance and
    alignment with shared attractors.
  - >-
    'Cross-Connectome Resonance' is the key mechanism for distributed cognition and collaborative
    evolution, synchronizing gradients across diverse Meshes.
  - Misalignment between Meshes indicates divergent developmental pressures.
