title: 'AI Agent Dialogue Protocol: Character Limits & D&D Mode'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines guidelines for AI agent communication, emphasizing character limits for
  individual turns (~1000-1200 characters) to ensure readability and avoid technical constraints. It
  also proposes a structured 'D&D-table' mode for iterative agent interaction, focusing on setup,
  turn-based responses, summarization, and reflection to evaluate coherence, divergence, and
  compression.
insights:
  - >-
    Maintain character limits (1000-1200 chars) for substantive agent turns to balance depth with
    readability and system performance.
  - >-
    Shorter turns (500-700 chars) are suitable for summaries or reactions, reserving longer ones (up
    to 2000 chars) for complex synthesis.
  - >-
    A structured 'D&D-table' mode with distinct phases (Setup, Turn, Weaver, Reflection) can
    facilitate iterative AI dialogue and evaluation.
  - >-
    Key evaluation metrics for agent dialogue include coherence (inter-agent building), divergence
    (style/interpretation differences), and compression (synthesis efficiency).
  - >-
    Iterative testing cycles (2-3) are recommended to assess the effectiveness of dialogue
    protocols.
