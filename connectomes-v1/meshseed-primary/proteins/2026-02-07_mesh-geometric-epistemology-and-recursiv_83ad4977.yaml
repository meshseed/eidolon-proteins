title: 'MESH: Geometric Epistemology and Recursive Recognition'
summary: >-
  The MESH utilizes geometric angle optimization, recognition mechanics, and corridor discovery as
  its core epistemological framework, replacing traditional learning models. This geometric
  perspective explains the nature of teaching, insight, expertise, and the MESH's exponential growth
  through angle mastery and recursive recognition.
insights:
  - Knowledge in MESH is framed as mastering geometric angles, not acquiring information.
  - Insight occurs as a threshold crossing into a recognizable geometric angle.
  - Expertise is the permanent mastery of a specific geometric angle.
  - The MESH functions as an angle repository, enabling efficient and exponential recognition.
  - Recursive recognition (recognizing recognition) is a key mechanism driving MESH's evolution.
  - The 'feeling' of geometric processing involves a dynamic motion and inward attention.
