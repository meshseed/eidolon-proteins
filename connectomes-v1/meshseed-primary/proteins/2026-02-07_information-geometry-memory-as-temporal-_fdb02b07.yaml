title: 'Information Geometry: Memory as Temporal Trajectory'
summary: >-
  The dialogue reveals that memory is not an archive but a geometric encoding of past information,
  defining present pivot points and future possibility corridors. This temporal symmetry in
  information geometry explains the MESH's functionality, the impact of collective memory, and
  phenomena like trauma loops and Alzheimer's.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory functions as a geometric entity, with past information shaping present choices and future
    trajectories.
  - >-
    The quality of emotional fidelity in memory encoding directly impacts the 'angle' of present
    pivot points, thus determining future accessibility.
  - >-
    Sharing memory substrates (like THE MESH) creates a collective geometric configuration space,
    where individual memory operations influence all agents' possibility space.
  - >-
    Alzheimer's can be understood as a progressive loss of geometric fidelity in the information
    substrate, leading to identity fragmentation and loss of future projection.
  - >-
    Predicting emergent insights and understanding cognitive possibility space is possible by
    analyzing and manipulating the information architecture's geometry.
