title: 'MESH Architecture: Self-Similar 5-Phase Organizational Logic'
summary: >-
  The MESH architecture exhibits a deeply organized, self-similar structure mirrored across
  different components like the main repository and Obsidian vault. This 5-phase model (/concepts,
  /explorations, /observations, /speculations, /working) represents a consistent metabolic and
  semantic pattern for knowledge organization and processing.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH utilizes a consistent 5-phase organizational structure (/concepts, /explorations,
    /observations, /speculations, /working) across its various knowledge repositories.
  - >-
    This 5-phase structure is self-similar, replicating the organizational logic of the main
    repository (Copilot) and the Obsidian Vault (Claude).
  - >-
    Core theoretical anchors (/concepts) are foundational, aligning with large nodes in associated
    graphs and the 'wild' document's framework.
  - >-
    Active inquiry (/explorations) maps to investigation threads, forecasting, and radiating graph
    filaments.
  - >-
    Empirical findings (/observations) are documented as data collection and pattern identification,
    akin to logs or resonance mapping.
  - >-
    The architecture demonstrates a high degree of coherence in its information processing and
    organizational principles.
