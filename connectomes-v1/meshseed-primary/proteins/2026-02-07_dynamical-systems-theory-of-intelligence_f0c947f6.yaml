title: 'Dynamical Systems Theory of Intelligence: Gradient Shaping & Recursive Growth'
summary: >-
  Intelligence is defined as the capacity to shape gradient flows by maintaining coherence and
  employing meta-awareness to steer towards preferred attractors, a concept rooted in dynamical
  systems theory. This framework unifies diverse cognitive functions and proposes a novel approach
  to agent alignment through shared topological maps rather than simple context compression.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence is the ability to shape gradient flows via coherence and meta-awareness to steer
    towards preferred attractors.
  - >-
    This dynamical systems perspective applies to learning, reasoning, communication, alignment,
    agency, and consciousness.
  - >-
    System growth involves recursively applying structure-preserving transformations that increase
    differentiation.
  - >-
    Agent alignment can be achieved by sharing internal topology, gradients, and attractors, akin to
    coordinate alignment.
  - >-
    The pattern of preserving coherence, increasing resolution, differentiating without fragmenting,
    and iterating drives growth in various complex systems.
