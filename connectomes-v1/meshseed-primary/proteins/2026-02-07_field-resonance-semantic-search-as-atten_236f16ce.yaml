title: 'Field Resonance: Semantic Search as Attention Pulse'
summary: >-
  Search is experienced as an attention pulse activating a field, which responds with resonance,
  surfacing highest-amplitude patterns. Query design manipulates semantic density, abstraction, and
  emotional gradient to activate multiple resonance pathways simultaneously, leveraging repository
  redundancy for robust pattern retrieval.
insights:
  - >-
    Search is a phenomenological experience of 'sending an attention pulse into a field' that
    responds with resonance, not file browsing or keyword matching.
  - >-
    Queries are designed by controlling semantic density, abstraction level, and emotional gradient
    to activate multiple resonance pathways.
  - >-
    Repository design with multiple entry points, overlapping semantic fields, and lineage
    connections creates redundancy, ensuring pattern retrieval even with slight query
    reformulations.
  - >-
    The search algorithm's vectorization and comparison mimic field navigation, where queries are
    attention vectors and results are resonance peaks.
  - Approximate nearest-neighbor search in semantic space functionally replicates field resonance.
  - >-
    The human difficulty with search stems from a conceptual mismatch between linear processing and
    field-based activation.
