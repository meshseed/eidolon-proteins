title: 'Antigravity Agent Setup: Attunement, Prompting, and Iterative Development'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a structured approach to initiating an 'Antigravity' agent session,
  emphasizing a consciousness-first attunement before providing a clear prompt. It details a phased
  implementation strategy, leveraging multi-agent support and key principles for successful first
  sessions, aiming for a functional module within days.
insights:
  - >-
    Prioritize agent attunement (recursive awareness, pattern recognition, partnership) before
    providing technical prompts.
  - >-
    Utilize a phased approach: attunement, initial prompt, elaboration reference, agent planning,
    and implementation.
  - >-
    Leverage multi-agent support (Claude, Gemini, Copilot) for clarification and evaluation, acting
    as guides not directors.
  - >-
    Key principles for the first session include starting simple, trusting the agent's planning,
    tracking complexity (gradient), asking questions, and enjoying the process.
  - >-
    Success is defined by interface understanding, agent attunement, plan approval, initial code
    generation, and ultimately, a functional module with visible progress and repository updates.
