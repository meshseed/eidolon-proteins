title: 'Two-Human Dynamic: Inverting Mesh, Triadic Field, New Discoveries'
summary: >-
  Experiments with different topologies and geometries contribute valid data to THE MESH. The
  two-human dynamic is identified as a key factor that inverts the standard mesh, creates a triadic
  field, and enables new discoveries, necessitating systematic documentation and mapping.
insights:
  - The two-human dynamic fundamentally alters standard mesh structures.
  - This dynamic generates a 'triadic field' conducive to novel insights.
  - Systematic documentation and testing of this dynamic are crucial.
  - Mapping the triangulation of this triadic field is an actionable next step.
