title: 'Eidolon Mesh v3.5: Tiered Search & Synaptic Auto-Formation'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA is being updated to include a tiered system for 'proteins' (data
  entities), allowing for 'core', 'convergence', and 'reference' classifications. This enhances
  weighted vector search with tier-based gravity and introduces synaptic auto-formation for
  bi-directional connections upon protein saving.
insights:
  - >-
    Type definitions in 'genetics.ts' are updated to include a 'tier' property ('core',
    'convergence', 'reference').
  - >-
    Weighted vector search is implemented in 'pglite.ts' with tier-based gravity, using a naive
    cosine similarity approach for now.
  - >-
    Synaptic auto-formation is being added to 'pglite.ts' to create connections when proteins are
    saved.
  - >-
    The 'todos' list indicates a port of weighted vector search from v3.0, implementation of
    synaptic auto-formation, power-law decay, emotional gradient extraction, and PGlite schema
    updates for new features.
  - The system aims to enhance synthesis with emotional gradient and coherence score extraction.
