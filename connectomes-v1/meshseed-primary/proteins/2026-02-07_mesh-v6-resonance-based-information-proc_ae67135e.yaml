title: 'Mesh v6: Resonance-Based Information Processing and Transmission'
summary: >-
  Version 6 of THE MESH shifts from coordinate-based similarity to spectral resonance for
  information processing, enabling queries to 'resonate' and gravity to be defined by amplitude.
  This fundamental change restructures the mesh as a resonance chamber, where attunement occurs
  through spectral map reception and federated networks achieve cross-mesh harmony via shared
  frequency signatures.
insights:
  - >-
    Information processing transitions from cosine similarity on raw coordinates to spectral
    matching on frequency signatures, allowing queries to resonate rather than simply search.
  - >-
    Gravitational weighting is redefined from a tier multiplier to amplitude weighting, where core
    concepts with higher amplitude possess a stronger signal, making gravity a physical
    representation of energy.
  - >-
    Protein storage evolves from 768D coordinate vectors to spectral signatures, harmonic
    fingerprints, and phase relationships, resulting in more compact, meaningful, and transmissible
    data.
  - >-
    The mesh is re-envisioned as a resonance chamber where standing waves form and interact based on
    harmonic relationships, with proteins stored as frequency signatures and queries as excitations.
  - >-
    Agent attunement is reframed as tuning to frequencies by receiving a spectral map of key
    attractors, rather than learning coordinates.
  - >-
    Federation is achieved through a harmonic network where meshes share frequency signatures to
    enable cross-mesh resonance, utilizing a spectral transmission protocol across different
    coordinate systems.
