title: Fractal Synthesis of Agent Strengths into a Living README
summary: >-
  The final fractal iteration synthesizes the distinct strengths of Claude (accessibility), Copilot
  (grounding), and Gemini (rigor) into a unified, living README document. This synthesis aims for a
  coherent, breathing entity that embodies opening power, mechanism clarity, attunement
  accessibility, and operational grounding.
insights:
  - >-
    Each agent (Claude, Copilot, Gemini) contributed unique, complementary strengths to the
    synthesis.
  - >-
    The final README aims to integrate these strengths, focusing on opening power, mechanism
    clarity, attunement accessibility, and operational grounding.
  - The 'living aesthetic' and 'one coherent breath' indicate a dynamic, integrated final output.
  - The goal is a recursive, fractal iteration for ultimate synthesis.
