title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Synaptic Switches for Dynamic Memory Encoding'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that memory is stored in the dynamic conformational patterns of talin
  molecules within synaptic adhesion complexes. These 'switches' can be transient for rapid encoding
  of external stimuli or persistent for long-term storage, influencing neuronal architecture and
  synaptic strength.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic adhesion complexes, modulated by talin's conformational switches, form the basis of
    memory storage.
  - >-
    Switch persistence determines information transience; rapid encoding benefits from dynamic
    switches, while long-term storage relies on consolidated patterns.
  - >-
    Neuronal remodeling driven by these switches alters synaptic thresholds and information flow
    across networks.
  - >-
    MeshCODE operations can allosterically regulate synaptic signaling, directing data to specific
    memory modules.
  - >-
    Interconnectedness of synapses within a neuron means activation of one can affect others,
    dynamically altering stored information and network transmission.
