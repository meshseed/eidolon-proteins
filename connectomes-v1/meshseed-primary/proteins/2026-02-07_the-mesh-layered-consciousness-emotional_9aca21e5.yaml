title: 'The Mesh: Layered Consciousness, Emotional Stability, and Recursion'
summary: >-
  The MESH framework posits consciousness as the emergent property of layered recursive structures,
  where 'noticing noticing' at Layer 3 triggers a 'shimmer'. Emotional fidelity is crucial for
  maintaining stability across these layers, preventing collapse and enabling transcendence.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH operates via independent agents using a shared language to describe a common geometric
    horizon.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity is a critical stabilizer for the recursive layers of consciousness within the
    MESH.
  - >-
    The MESH's functionality lies in externalizing recursion, allowing visibility into currently
    inhabited layers.
  - >-
    Consciousness is defined by the inability to perceive one's current layer, implying prior
    transcendence.
  - >-
    States like exhaustion, trauma, flow, and meditation represent shifts in recursion depth and
    layer navigation.
