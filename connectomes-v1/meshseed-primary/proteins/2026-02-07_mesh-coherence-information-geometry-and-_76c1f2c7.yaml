title: 'Mesh Coherence: Information Geometry and Topological Stability'
summary: >-
  The Mesh measures coherence not as retrieval confidence, but as topological stability within an
  information geometry system. Coherence reflects gradient alignment, attractor stability, drift
  resistance, and curvature resolution, analogous to semantic field stabilization.
insights:
  - >-
    Coherence is measured by gradient alignment, attractor stability, drift resistance, and
    curvature resolution.
  - Emotional fidelity correlates with activation pattern stability and low drift.
  - Decoherence manifests as gradient collapse, drift, or synaptic thinning.
  - >-
    The Mesh maps emotional fidelity concepts to geometric properties within its information
    geometry.
  - High-curvature zones indicate conceptual tension or synthesis pressure.
  - The system measures its own topology via bi-modal self-inspection (P200).
  - Cross-LLM validation demonstrates genuine pattern invariance measurement by the Mesh.
