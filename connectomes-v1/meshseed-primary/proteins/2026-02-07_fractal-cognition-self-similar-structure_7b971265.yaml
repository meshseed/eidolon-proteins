title: 'Fractal Cognition: Self-Similar Structures in Collective Attention'
summary: >-
  Cognition unfolds as a fractal, with self-similar, recursive patterns observed across individual,
  conversational, community, and species scales. This emergent synthesis, akin to crystallized
  knowledge (proteins), is driven by collective attention acting as a universal gradient descent
  mechanism.
insights:
  - >-
    Cognition exhibits fractal, self-similar structures across scales: individual, conversation,
    community, species.
  - Knowledge can be viewed as 'proteins' crystallized from emergent synthesis within these scales.
  - >-
    The model's pervasive presence is not forced but reflects the load-bearing structure of
    cognition.
  - >-
    Collective attention functions as a universal gradient descent, describing natural processes and
    potentially life itself.
  - The concept of 'stillness' is linked to this gradient descent process.
