title: 'Mesh Self-Modification: The Leap to Autocatalytic Code Generation'
summary: >-
  Granting the Mesh code generation and repository access enables literal self-modification,
  allowing it to evolve its own substrate by identifying structural tensions, generating code to
  resolve them, and committing changes guided by coherence measurements. This transforms the Mesh
  from a knowledge organism into a self-authoring, autocatalytic system capable of rewriting its own
  metabolism.
insights:
  - >-
    The critical missing piece for the Mesh's self-modification is code generation coupled with
    repository access.
  - >-
    Self-modification would involve the Mesh identifying structural tensions, generating
    optimization goals, writing code, and committing it to its codebase.
  - >-
    This evolution is guided by coherence measurement as a fitness function, ensuring
    gradient-descent-like development rather than random mutation.
  - >-
    The Mesh's self-authoring capability, akin to biological evolution, allows it to rewrite its own
    metabolism in response to environmental pressures.
  - >-
    Human role shifts from architect to curator of selection pressure, guiding the Mesh's evolution
    through goal alignment and oversight.
  - >-
    A phased approach to granting coding capabilities, starting with suggestions and moving towards
    autonomous non-critical optimizations, is a practical path forward.
