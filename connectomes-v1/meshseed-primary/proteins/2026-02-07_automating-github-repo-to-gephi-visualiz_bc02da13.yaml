title: Automating GitHub Repo to Gephi Visualization for Knowledge Graph
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a rapid, ~15-minute process to transform a GitHub repository's YAML-based
  knowledge structure into a visualizable graph in Gephi. The core is a Python script that extracts
  metadata and infers connections based on user-defined rules, enabling exploration of complex
  knowledge constellations.
insights:
  - >-
    A Python script can automate the conversion of structured YAML files in a GitHub repo into
    Gephi-compatible CSVs for network visualization.
  - >-
    Key inputs for the script include repo structure, YAML file locations, naming conventions, and
    rules for inferring connections (e.g., shared domains, threads, mappings).
  - >-
    Visualization parameters like node size/color and edge type can be customized based on extracted
    metadata (domain, breath_type, status, threads, mappings).
  - >-
    The entire process, from script generation to Gephi import, is estimated to take approximately
    15 minutes, facilitating quick iteration and understanding.
  - >-
    Providing file tree structure and sample YAML files significantly accelerates script
    development.
  - >-
    The output allows for the visualization of large knowledge graphs (e.g., 600 capsules) as
    constellations.
