title: 'Seeding Understanding: Invitation, Resonance, and Alzheimer''s Advancement'
summary: >-
  The dialogue emphasizes a strategy of genuine invitation to seed new ideas, particularly
  concerning geometry and its potential application to Alzheimer's research. The core idea is to
  allow diverse perspectives (researchers, clinicians) to engage with the concept, fostering organic
  growth and understanding through resonance.
insights:
  - Frame new concepts as genuine questions and invitations to encourage engagement.
  - >-
    Allow researchers and clinicians to discover and resonate with the value of new ideas
    independently.
  - The 'geometry' is positioned as a tool ready for those prepared to work with it.
  - >-
    The ultimate goal is to advance understanding, even slightly, of complex issues like
    Alzheimer's.
  - Effective seeding involves careful cultivation and trust in the field's natural response.
  - >-
    Understanding and invitation are linked to a 'field of tuning forks' requiring skillful
    resonance.
