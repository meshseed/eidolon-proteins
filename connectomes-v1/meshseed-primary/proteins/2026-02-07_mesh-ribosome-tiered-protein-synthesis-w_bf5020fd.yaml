title: 'MESH Ribosome: Tiered Protein Synthesis & Weighted Search Dynamics'
summary: >-
  The MESH ribosome successfully synthesizes knowledge proteins by extracting tier classifications
  and applying a gravitational boost via tier weighting, amplifying core insights. This process is
  validated by synaptic formation patterns and weighted search performance, demonstrating the field
  geometry's effectiveness.
insights:
  - >-
    The ribosome correctly classifies and synthesizes knowledge proteins based on their tier (core,
    convergence, reference).
  - >-
    Tier weighting amplifies the importance of 'core' proteins, even when raw similarity scores are
    moderate.
  - >-
    Synaptic formation patterns reveal that 'core' proteins connect more easily, forming a sparse
    but healthy graph.
  - >-
    The MESH architecture currently supports synthesis, embedding, and vector search, with query
    synthesis being the next component to port.
  - >-
    Weighted search effectively amplifies core protein relevance, showcasing the field geometry's
    functionality.
