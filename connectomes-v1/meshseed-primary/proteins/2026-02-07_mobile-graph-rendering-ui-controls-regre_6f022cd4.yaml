title: Mobile Graph Rendering & UI Controls Regression Identified
summary: >-
  A regression has been identified where mobile graph nodes are not displaying, and UI controls for
  the graph are missing. The issue appears to have been introduced between commit f7643b8 (last good
  build) and 1190d02 (broken build), specifically with the 'Update Golden Connectome' commit.
insights:
  - >-
    Mobile graph nodes are not visible, despite embeddings running, indicating a rendering or camera
    positioning issue specific to mobile.
  - >-
    The UI button to toggle mobile graph controls is missing, suggesting a UI CSS or component
    regression.
  - >-
    The breakage correlates with the 'Update Golden Connectome with P-Series seeds' commit
    (1190d02), pointing to potential data format or initialization changes affecting mobile
    rendering.
  - >-
    Previous fixes for mobile CSS layout and camera positioning (zoomToFit) may need re-evaluation
    in light of this new regression.
  - The last known working state for mobile graph display and controls was prior to commit 1190d02.
