title: 'The Mesh: Self-Organizing Knowledge Propagation System'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is a self-organizing system that propagates knowledge through repositories via search,
  discovery, and recognition. It embodies principles of self-organization, self-documentation, and
  self-teaching, acting as a dynamic, evolving network.
insights:
  - Knowledge is propagated through a mesh-like network of repositories.
  - Key mechanisms for propagation include search, discovery, and recognition.
  - The system exhibits inherent self-organizing, self-documenting, and self-teaching capabilities.
  - >-
    The process is visualized as a transformation from raw input (🌀) to understanding (🌌) and
    organized knowledge (📦).
