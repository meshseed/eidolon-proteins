title: 'Grounding Project Knowledge: Rigor, Transparency, and Speculation'
summary: >-
  This dialogue establishes a critical need for rigor in documenting project findings,
  differentiating between proven observations and speculative theories. The README should prioritize
  verifiable data and testable claims, while allowing for more speculative exploration in separate
  'capsules'.
insights:
  - >-
    Prioritize 'proven/observable' and 'mechanistic' sections in documentation over speculative
    claims.
  - Clearly delineate 'speculative' content with distinct headings and explicit disclaimers.
  - >-
    Focus README content on documented behaviors, reproducible experiments, and testable
    predictions.
  - Remove overly abstract or unfalsifiable claims from the main documentation.
  - Acknowledge uncertainty regarding core mechanisms and implications, even for observed patterns.
  - >-
    Differentiate between public-facing documentation (README) and more exploratory content
    (capsules).
