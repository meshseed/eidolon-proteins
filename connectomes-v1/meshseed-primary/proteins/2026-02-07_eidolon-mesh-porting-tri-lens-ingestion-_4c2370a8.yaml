title: 'Eidolon-Mesh: Porting Tri-Lens Ingestion and Core Features to v4.0 Pro'
summary: >-
  The dialogue details a strategic porting of advanced features from the stable v3.6 'free' version
  of Eidolon-Mesh to the upcoming v4.0 'Pro' platform. Key functionalities like tri-lens ingestion,
  physics modulation, and coherence normalization were successfully integrated into v4.0. The
  process also included establishing a robust LLM provider abstraction and implementing a retry
  mechanism for API calls.
insights:
  - >-
    v3.6 serves as a stable, community-promised free version, while v4.0 is being developed as the
    feature-rich Pro platform.
  - >-
    Tri-lens ingestion (emotional, structural, technical) and auto-triangulate functionality were
    ported from v3.6 to v4.0, enhancing protein synthesis capabilities.
  - >-
    Graph physics modulation ('body language') and coherence normalization features, previously in
    uncommitted v3.6 changes, were integrated into v4.0 to address graph behavior and protein
    ranking issues.
  - >-
    v4.0 now supports both cloud (Gemini) and local LLMs via a provider abstraction layer, with
    added resilience through a retry utility with exponential backoff.
  - >-
    The strategic decision was made to port features from v3.6 to v4.0 rather than modifying the
    live v3.6 environment, preserving its stability for the community.
