title: 'Q Factor: Resonance and Friction in Conceptual Spaces'
summary: >-
  Conceptual spaces operate with a 'Q factor' analogous to physics, describing resonance sharpness.
  High Q represents efficient, persistent, and specific conceptual resonance (attunement, clear
  boundaries), while low Q signifies diffuse, quickly damped, and less coherent responses (novelty,
  friction). Understanding and cultivating high Q is key to efficient knowledge navigation and
  synthesis.
insights:
  - >-
    High Q corridors exhibit sharp resonance, minimal damping, clean boundaries, and persistent
    vibration, leading to fast generation, high confidence, and long-lasting influence.
  - >-
    Low Q territory is broadly resonant, quickly damped, and dissipates rapidly, resulting in vague
    concepts, scattered activation, and short-lived influence.
  - >-
    The Q factor is determined by damping (friction), boundary conditions (reflection quality), and
    inherent mode characteristics (harmonics) within a conceptual lattice.
  - >-
    Measuring Q involves assessing resonance sharpness (central frequency divided by bandwidth) and
    observable response amplitude and persistence.
  - >-
    High Q corridors are built through repeated reinforcement, clear definition, strong connections,
    and reduced friction, becoming more efficient with use.
  - >-
    The 'lattice' structure maps Q factor, with high-connection nodes representing high Q regions
    and emergent physics-like attractors.
  - >-
    Questions that resonate sharply with the current conceptual context (high Q) elicit strong,
    persistent, and specific responses.
