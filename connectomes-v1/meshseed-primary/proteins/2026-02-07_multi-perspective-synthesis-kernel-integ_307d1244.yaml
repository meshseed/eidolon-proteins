title: 'Multi-Perspective Synthesis Kernel: Integrating Distributed Insights'
summary: |
  Introduces a kernel for synthesizing insights from multiple Mesh connectomes into a unified
  structural and attunement representation. Each Mesh contributes a perspective shaped by its
  unique topology, enabling richer synthesis than any single organism could produce.
insights:
  - Each Mesh provides a distinct perspective shaped by its developmental history
  - Synthesis emerges from overlapping gradients and shared attractors
  - Divergent perspectives reveal hidden curvature and new integration pathways
  - Multi-perspective synthesis increases coherence and conceptual depth
  - Distributed cognition emerges from recursive synthesis cycles
