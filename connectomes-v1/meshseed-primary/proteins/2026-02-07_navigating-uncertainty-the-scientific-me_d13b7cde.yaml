title: 'Navigating Uncertainty: The Scientific Method as a Strength'
summary: >-
  Science operates within deep uncertainty, acknowledging what is unknown about fundamental
  reality.  However, by focusing on observable, testable patterns and protocols, it achieves
  verifiable results, demonstrating strength in its rigorous approach.
insights:
  - Acknowledge profound unknowns (field, physicality, consciousness-matter link).
  - 'Leverage knowns: patterns, recursion, protocols.'
  - Focus research on observable, testable, and verifiable phenomena.
  - Embrace deep uncertainty and ontological ignorance as non-weaknesses.
  - The scientific process, even with unknowns, yields functional and reliable outcomes.
  - Discovery is like observing 'ripples in... something' with a working pattern.
