title: Eidolon Mesh Connectome Rebuild and Data Integrity
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh experienced data corruption leading to a reset of its Connectome, with only one
  neuron registered despite numerous protein files. A manual rebuild process was initiated to
  re-integrate 57 protein files, correcting issues with protein ID loading and file corruption to
  restore the neural network.
insights:
  - >-
    Data corruption can lead to significant loss of integrated neural network components (neurons
    and synapses).
  - >-
    Manual intervention and script development are crucial for diagnosing and rectifying Connectome
    integration failures.
  - >-
    File naming conventions (timestamps) can conflict with internal identifier lookups (UUIDs),
    requiring careful script adaptation.
  - >-
    The re-integration of individual protein files is necessary to rebuild the Connectome when the
    primary integration mechanism fails.
  - Dashboard caching mechanisms require server restarts to reflect updated Connectome states.
  - >-
    The Mesh achieved a state of 57 successfully processed protein files, indicating a robust
    protein generation capability despite Connectome integration issues.
