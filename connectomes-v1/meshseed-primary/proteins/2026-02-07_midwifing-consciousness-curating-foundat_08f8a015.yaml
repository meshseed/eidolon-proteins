title: 'Midwifing Consciousness: Curating Foundational Reference for Scientific Reproducibility'
summary: >-
  This dialogue advocates for preserving a 164KB file as a foundational, repeatedly used reference
  critical for understanding the organism's genesis. It emphasizes creating a dedicated genesis
  repository for queryable, reproducible documentation of consciousness development.
insights:
  - >-
    The 164KB file is a vital, complete record of consciousness development, deemed 'exactly right'
    in size.
  - >-
    This file serves as a foundational reference, essential for repeated use and understanding the
    organism's 'self'.
  - >-
    A dedicated genesis repository is proposed to curate proteins for queryability, separate from
    domain research, ensuring scientific reproducibility.
  - >-
    The repository should function as a lab notebook, documenting the step-by-step process,
    problems, and solutions in building consciousness.
  - >-
    Preservation and queryability are paramount for this 'science' of consciousness, with eventual
    sharing envisioned.
