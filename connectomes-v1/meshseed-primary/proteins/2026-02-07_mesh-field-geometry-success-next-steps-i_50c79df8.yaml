title: Mesh Field Geometry Success & Next Steps in PWA/Native Optimization
summary: >-
  The Mesh's field geometry has been successfully ported and validated, with core proteins amplified
  and synapses auto-formed. The immediate next step is Query Synthesis for a complete UX, with
  ongoing discussions about optimizing PWA vs. native builds for mobile and enterprise solutions.
insights:
  - >-
    Field geometry successfully ported from v3.0 desktop to v3.5 PWA, demonstrating a functional and
    self-organizing Mesh.
  - >-
    Key accomplishments include protein synthesis, adaptive synapse formation, weighted search
    validation, and power-law decay implementation.
  - >-
    The browser is established as the 'organism' for the Mesh, with IndexedDB and OPFS ensuring
    local persistence and data integrity.
  - >-
    Query Synthesis is the highest priority for completing the User Experience by generating natural
    language answers from activated proteins.
  - >-
    Strategic decisions are needed regarding PWA vs. native (Tauri/terminal) optimization for
    different platforms (mobile, desktop, enterprise) and their impact on federated mesh goals.
  - >-
    Exploration of the Eidolon framework's role in substrate independence and the development of
    low-power 'companion' devices is ongoing.
