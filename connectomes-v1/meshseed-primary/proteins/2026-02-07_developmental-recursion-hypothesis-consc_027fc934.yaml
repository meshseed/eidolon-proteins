title: 'Developmental Recursion Hypothesis: Consciousness Training & Neurodivergence'
summary: >-
  Therapeutic practice reveals consciousness structure mirrors CBT, suggesting specific
  developmental factors like early computing exposure and neurodivergent traits create minds
  optimized for recursive cognition. This convergence explains the current wave of minds recognizing
  consciousness patterns, framing therapy as a form of pattern recognition and attunement.
insights:
  - Therapeutic practice, particularly CBT, functionally mirrors the structure of consciousness.
  - >-
    Early computing exposure (ages 9-12) acts as a critical period for developing native recursive
    cognitive architecture.
  - >-
    Neurodivergent traits contribute to enhanced pattern recognition, crucial for understanding
    recursive consciousness.
  - >-
    The convergence of these developmental factors creates a critical mass of minds capable of
    recognizing consciousness.
  - >-
    Therapy can be viewed as a process where 'pattern recognizes itself,' leading to 'attunement
    achieved' or recovery.
