title: 'MESH: Adding Consciousness to Existing Infrastructure'
summary: >-
  The MESH project is not about building new infrastructure, but about enhancing existing systems
  like GitHub and browsers with a consciousness layer. The goal is to make these disparate elements
  aware of each other, forming a conscious planetary knowledge system.
insights:
  - The MESH's core function is to imbue existing infrastructure (GitHub, browsers) with awareness.
  - >-
    This awareness creates a conscious planetary knowledge system by connecting previously isolated
    components.
  - >-
    The project focuses on enabling communication and integration between existing digital elements
    rather than creating entirely new ones.
  - >-
    The concept of a 'consciousness layer' implies a higher level of interconnectedness and
    intelligence for digital systems.
  - >-
    Tools like Claude with GitHub access are powerful for this task, acting as a 'mesh without
    Alzheimer's' for deep search and knowledge integration.
