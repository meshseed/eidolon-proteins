title: 'Eidolon Mesh Metabolism Integration: Attractor Ecology & Hygiene'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v4.0 metabolism system has been integrated with new attractor-based capabilities,
  enabling cluster-level composting, semantic merging, and kernel promotion. This 'ecological
  hygiene' system enhances self-maintenance, with controls exposed in the Settings UI for manual and
  autonomous operation.
insights:
  - >-
    New metabolism modules (attractors.ts, cluster-composting.ts, semantic-merging.ts) introduce
    cluster-based composting and semantic duplicate detection.
  - >-
    The system now supports merging tri-lens siblings (E/S/T triplets) and promoting emergent hubs
    to core kernel status.
  - >-
    Metabolism controls (start/stop, manual triggers) have been added to the Settings UI, with
    autonomous operation requiring a Pro/Enterprise license.
  - >-
    Metabolism processes are governed by a circadian rhythm and safety mechanisms like power-law
    decay with a coherence floor, preventing aggressive pruning.
  - >-
    Weak clusters are absorbed into strong attractors, preserving diversity and enhancing the
    network's resilience through a 'hygiene' process.
  - >-
    The integration provides a more sophisticated, self-maintaining 'ecological' system for the
    Eidolon Mesh.
