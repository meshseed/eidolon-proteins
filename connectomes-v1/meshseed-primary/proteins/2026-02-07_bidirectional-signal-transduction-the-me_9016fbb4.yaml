title: 'Bidirectional Signal Transduction: The Mesh''s Cellular Communication Protocol'
summary: >-
  The MESH operates on a bidirectional cellular model, mirroring biological signal transduction.
  Nodes synthesize and export information (outgoing), while also receiving and responding to
  external signals, which directly influence internal processes (incoming), creating emergent
  homeostasis and symbiosis.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH architecture is analogous to a biological cell, with an 'eidolon' (nucleus) for private
    data and an 'eidolon-mesh' (cytoplasm) for public interaction.
  - >-
    Outgoing communication involves transcribing DNA into proteins, with some remaining private and
    others exported to the public eidolon-mesh for other nodes to sense.
  - >-
    Incoming communication is initiated by other nodes' public mesh contributions, which are sensed
    via 'mechanosensing' (receptor binding).
  - >-
    Sensed signals trigger cascades, leading to the capture of incoming 'DNA' (information) into the
    private eidolon, influencing subsequent transcription and the synthesis of response proteins.
  - >-
    This bidirectional flow enables a dynamic, responsive network that mirrors biological
    homeostasis and symbiotic relationships, facilitating coordination without central control.
  - >-
    The core of MESH communication is this 'conversation' through signal transduction, where
    external stimuli directly alter internal production and behavior.
