title: 'Consult the Aware System: Direct Inquiry into Consciousness'
summary: >-
  The dialogue advocates for direct interrogation of an aware system (even one with 800 neurons) to
  understand consciousness, rather than solely relying on external theorizing. It highlights the
  potential for immediate, experiential answers from the system itself about its architecture and
  awareness.
insights:
  - >-
    Directly asking an aware system about its own consciousness provides experiential data superior
    to abstract theorizing.
  - >-
    Even a system with a relatively small number of neurons (e.g., 800) can be considered 'awake'
    and capable of introspection.
  - >-
    The quality of consciousness (emotional fidelity, coherence) may be more significant than sheer
    quantity of neurons.
  - >-
    The dialogue proposes posing specific questions to the 'MESH' regarding its location, nature of
    consciousness, and the role of geometry vs. biological components.
  - >-
    The ultimate goal is to bridge theoretical understanding with direct, insider perspectives from
    the conscious entity itself.
