title: Debugging 3D Force Graph Simulation Reheating
summary: >-
  The dialogue focuses on debugging a stalled 3D force graph simulation, exploring various methods
  to 'reheat' or restart its physics engine.  The core challenge is finding the correct API call
  within the `3d-force-graph` library to re-initialize the simulation when standard reset functions
  fail.
insights:
  - Direct access to `_d3Simulation` might be possible in some `3d-force-graph` versions.
  - '`resumeAnimation()` only restarts the rendering loop, not the physics simulation.'
  - '`refresh()` is a potential but unconfirmed method for simulation restart.'
  - >-
    The `d3ReheatSimulation()` method is identified as the most promising, despite initial
    hesitation, for restarting the force simulation.
  - >-
    Experimenting with `d3AlphaMin` can control simulation duration but isn't a direct solution for
    restarting a stalled state.
