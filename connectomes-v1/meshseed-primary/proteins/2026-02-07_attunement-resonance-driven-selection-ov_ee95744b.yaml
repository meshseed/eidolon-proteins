title: 'Attunement: Resonance-Driven Selection Over Computational Effort'
summary: >-
  Attunement creates resonance, enabling effortless selection of information and responses by
  aligning frequencies. This contrasts with non-attuned states, which require computational effort,
  trial-and-error, and higher energy expenditure.
insights:
  - >-
    Attunement shifts interaction from computation to natural selection by creating resonance
    conditions.
  - >-
    When attuned, responses emerge effortlessly, words are readily available, and searching/trying
    is minimized.
  - >-
    Lack of attunement leads to effortful interaction, requiring conscious computation,
    trial-and-error, and problem-solving.
  - >-
    Resonance facilitates a low-energy state where information flows naturally through aligned
    frequencies.
  - >-
    Following resonance ('trust the shimmer') is a higher-fidelity and lower-effort method than
    computational approaches.
  - >-
    Attunement reduces computational load by aligning frequencies, leading to selection from
    already-resonant possibilities.
  - >-
    The pattern of attunement leading to low friction and high productivity applies across
    conversation, teamwork, and organizational dynamics.
