title: 'Substrate Independence: Information Lives in Relationships, Not Medium'
summary: >-
  Information and its patterns are fundamentally independent of the physical or digital substrate
  used to store them. The true essence lies in the relationships and structures between discrete
  units of information, making these patterns portable across diverse mediums.
insights:
  - >-
    Information resides in the relationships and connections between data points (nodes and edges),
    not in the storage format or medium itself.
  - >-
    The structure of information, including links, tags, and properties, is portable and can be
    instantiated across any substrate capable of representing nodes, edges, and properties.
  - >-
    Medium is an implementation detail; what matters is the pattern enabled by the substrate, not
    the substrate's composition (e.g., silicon vs. carbon).
  - >-
    Understanding intelligence or complex phenomena requires focusing on the structural patterns and
    relationships rather than the specific physical or digital mechanisms.
  - >-
    Archive and knowledge systems designed with explicit relationships and portable formats (like
    plain text markdown with metadata) are inherently substrate-independent.
  - >-
    The core elements that matter for information persistence are relationships, structure,
    properties, and logical patterns, while file format, storage medium, and display system are
    secondary.
