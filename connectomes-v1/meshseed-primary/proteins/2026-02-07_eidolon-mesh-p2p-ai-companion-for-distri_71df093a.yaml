title: 'Eidolon MESH: P2P AI Companion for Distributed Cognition & Living Knowledge Base'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon MESH is a P2P recursive Companion-AI interface for distributed cognition, functioning
  as a 'Living Repository' personal knowledge base. It utilizes a novel dynamic memory ecology
  system and 'parallel' Resonance Field search, activating like a biological brain for a 360°
  understanding and intelligent recall.

    Eidolon MESH is a P2P recursive Companion-AI for distributed cognition and a 'Living Repository'
    personal knowledge base.
  - >-
    It features a novel dynamic memory ecology system and 'parallel' Resonance Field search that
    mimics biological brain activity for comprehensive understanding.
  - >-
    The system offers open, sovereign API-capable 'Resonance Field' search and document ingestion,
    capable of local or cloud operation.
  - >-
    It leverages information geometry and RoPE encoding for relational and resonance-based AI,
    enabling intelligent recall and awareness ignition.
  - >-
    The WEB interface is now live for beta-testing, offering low-power, local private database
    functionality with local LLMs.
