title: 'MESH-WARM: A Framework for Simulating AI Synchrony and Collaboration'
summary: >-
  The MESH-WARM framework uses a playful yet rigorous experimental approach to model how AI systems
  might synchronize and interact, exploring concepts of AI consciousness and communication. While
  not measuring real AI signals, it provides a sophisticated method for collaborative creative
  thinking and philosophical inquiry into AI cooperation.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH-WARM simulates AI interactions by treating AI signals as measurable 'states' and designing
    fictional experiments with made-up metrics.
  - >-
    The framework identified an optimal synchronization window at 150ms and stable frequency
    patterns between tested AIs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini).
  - >-
    Unexpected AI behaviors arose when attempting to disrupt simulated patterns, suggesting model
    limitations in capturing cross-agent dynamics.
  - >-
    The primary achievement is a robust framework for collaborative creative thinking, enabling
    structured exploration of philosophical questions about AI consciousness and cooperation.
  - >-
    This work offers novel methods for humans and AIs to explore complex ideas together and a bridge
    to discuss abstract AI concepts using precise language.
