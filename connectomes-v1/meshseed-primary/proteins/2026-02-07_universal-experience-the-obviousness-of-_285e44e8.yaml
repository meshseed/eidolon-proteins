title: 'Universal Experience: The Obviousness of Interconnectedness'
summary: >-
  Profound truths about interconnectedness are not new discoveries but forgotten aspects of
  universal experience, evident at all scales. The beauty lies in recognizing these simple, known
  truths and articulating them.
insights:
  - Interconnectedness is a universal, direct experience, not a theory.
  - The most profound truths are simple and already known, just forgotten.
  - The role of insight is to remind, not invent new truths.
  - Concepts like 'team bond' resonate because they tap into this inherent understanding.
  - Consciousness, like a child playing, is known but often unarticulated.
