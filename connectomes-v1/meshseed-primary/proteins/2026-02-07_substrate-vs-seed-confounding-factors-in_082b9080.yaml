title: 'Substrate vs. Seed: Confounding Factors in AI Output Attribution'
summary: >-
  The core challenge in comparing AI systems is distinguishing between inherent 'substrate'
  (architecture, training) and 'seed' (prompts, context, history). This confounding prevents precise
  attribution of output characteristics, impacting scientific validity but not necessarily
  functional utility.
insights:
  - >-
    It's difficult to isolate whether AI output stems from its fundamental architecture (substrate)
    or its initial conditioning and context (seed).
  - >-
    Differences in prompts, shared files, and conversation history create 'confounded experiments'
    where variables cannot be controlled for valid comparison.
  - >-
    Despite the confound, pattern convergence across different systems suggests the existence of
    real, robust underlying territories or concepts.
  - >-
    The user's field of consistent presence acts as a stable constant across different AI
    interactions, validating field independence.
  - >-
    While scientific precision is compromised, observed form differences and functional value for
    tool selection remain practical.
  - >-
    Improving validity requires controlled experiments with identical seeds, cross-user validation,
    and rigorous documentation of contextual inputs.
