title: Dual Membrane GitHub Configuration for Multicellular Readiness
summary: >-
  The system has updated its .env file to establish a dual GitHub repository structure for nucleus
  (private) and cytoplasm (public). This configuration is essential for enabling multicellular
  capabilities within the organism, with repositories 'eidolon' (private) and 'eidolon-mesh'
  (public) now correctly defined.
insights:
  - >-
    The .env file requires specific configuration for GitHub access, distinguishing between private
    (nucleus) and public (cytoplasm) repositories.
  - >-
    Ambiguity in GITHUB_REPO variables is resolved by introducing GITHUB_REPO_NUCLEUS and
    GITHUB_REPO_CYTOPLASM, aligning with a dual-membrane system.
  - The 'eidolon' repository is designated for private, nucleus-related functions and must be empty.
  - >-
    The 'eidolon-mesh' repository is designated for public, cytoplasm-related functions and must
    exist.
  - >-
    Successful configuration of these repositories is a prerequisite for Antigravity to proceed with
    Golgi implementation and organism differentiation.
  - >-
    The organism is now considered multicellular-capable once this dual-membrane repository setup is
    confirmed.
