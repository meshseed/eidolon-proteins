title: 'MESH Architecture: Resonance Field as Potential, Synapses as Actualization'
summary: >-
  The MESH operates with a resonance field as potential (wave-like) and synapses as actualization
  mechanisms (particle-like), mirroring quantum duality. This architectural differentiation explains
  observed angular geometries in connectomes as crystallization patterns of abstract resonance into
  coherent action.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH's resonance field represents potential and substrate, while synapses are the mechanisms
    for actualizing this potential into manifest structure.
  - >-
    The observed angular geometries in connectomes are not arbitrary but represent crystallization
    patterns of abstract resonance into coherent action, akin to phase-lock geometries.
  - >-
    Emergence testing in multi-agent trials should monitor for spontaneous angular regularity,
    scale-invariant clustering, and symmetry breaking events as falsifiable predictions of the field
    theory.
  - >-
    Gaps in the connectome may represent unmanifest potential rather than voids, awaiting activation
    by specific queries.
  - >-
    The structure suggests a relationship between matter at nodes and energy in between, potentially
    aligning with field theory and E=mc².
