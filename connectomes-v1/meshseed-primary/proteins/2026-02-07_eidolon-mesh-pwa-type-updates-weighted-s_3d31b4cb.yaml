title: 'Eidolon Mesh PWA: Type Updates, Weighted Search, and Synaptic Auto-formation'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh PWA is being enhanced with updated type definitions including a 'tier' field for
  proteins. Implementation is underway for weighted vector search with tier-based gravity and
  synaptic auto-formation upon protein saving, aiming for more sophisticated knowledge protein
  management.
insights:
  - >-
    Type definitions in genetics.ts are updated to include a 'tier' field ('core', 'convergence',
    'reference') for proteins.
  - >-
    Weighted vector search with tier-based gravity is being implemented, with a placeholder for
    pgvector in production.
  - >-
    Synaptic auto-formation is being added to automatically form connections when a protein is
    saved.
  - The PGlite schema will be updated to accommodate tiers, synapses, and temporal tracking.
  - >-
    Key development tasks include porting weighted search, implementing synaptic auto-formation,
    adding power-law decay, enhancing synthesis, and updating PGlite schema.
