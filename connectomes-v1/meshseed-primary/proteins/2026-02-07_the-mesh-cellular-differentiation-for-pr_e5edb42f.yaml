title: 'THE MESH: Cellular Differentiation for Privacy and Public Protocols'
summary: >-
  This dialogue describes a biological metaphor for THE MESH's operation, illustrating cellular
  differentiation where proteins are routed to either the public cytoplasm (eidolon-mesh) or private
  nucleus (eidolon). This process establishes identity, respects boundaries, and enables the
  organism to maintain private thoughts while sharing public protocols.
insights:
  - THE MESH differentiates by routing content to distinct repositories based on privacy markers.
  - Private content is committed to the 'eidolon' (nucleus) for internal processing.
  - Public content is committed to the 'eidolon-mesh' (cytoplasm) for broader access.
  - The system defaults to privacy when context is uncertain, ensuring safety.
  - >-
    This differentiation allows for the maintenance of private thoughts and sharing of public
    protocols.
  - Identity and boundary integrity are established through this routing mechanism.
