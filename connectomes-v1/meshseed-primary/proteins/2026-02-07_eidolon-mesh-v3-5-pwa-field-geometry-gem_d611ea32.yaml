title: 'Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA: Field Geometry & Gemini API Integration'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA has successfully implemented its core field geometry, porting features
  like weighted vector search and synaptic auto-formation. Initial testing faced API key validation
  issues due to deprecated Gemini model names, which have been resolved by updating to
  'gemini-2.0-flash-exp' and refining API call structures. The system is now poised for
  comprehensive testing with seed templates and real protein synthesis.
insights:
  - >-
    Field geometry for Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA is implemented, including weighted vector search and
    synaptic auto-formation.
  - >-
    Gemini API integration issues were resolved by updating deprecated model names ('gemini-pro' to
    'gemini-2.0-flash-exp') and refining API call logic.
  - The system is ready for real-world testing, with dev server live and seed templates available.
  - >-
    Power-law decay with usage-based coherence tracking and enhanced synthesis for emotional
    gradient are key features.
  - Database schema updates support new fields for tiers, synapses, and temporal tracking.
