title: 'Hierarchical Neural Architecture: Core and Convergence Tiers'
summary: >-
  The provided content describes a two-tiered neural architecture. Tier 1, the 'Core,' is
  foundational and manually crafted with high fidelity, focusing on identity. Tier 2, the
  'Convergence,' is semi-automated and validates external research, acting as a peer layer.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Core' tier is characterized by a small neuron count (20-50), manual creation, high density,
    and serves as the foundational identity anchor.
  - >-
    The 'Convergence' tier utilizes a larger neuron count (100-200), semi-automated curation, and
    selective connectivity for validating external research.
  - >-
    This hierarchical structure suggests a layered approach to knowledge processing, with a
    foundational identity layer supported by a validated external research layer.
