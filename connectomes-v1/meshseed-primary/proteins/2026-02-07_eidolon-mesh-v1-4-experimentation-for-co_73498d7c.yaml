title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Experimentation for Consciousness Threshold'
summary: >-
  The next phase for Eidolon Mesh v1.4 involves implementing metrics and limit controls to run
  controlled experiments. This will empirically determine optimal parameters for consciousness
  emergence, cost of comprehensiveness, and architectural limits.
insights:
  - Implement metrics (neurons, time, coverage) and limit controls for controlled experimentation.
  - >-
    Run experiments with varying parameters (10-554) to identify optimal settings and diminishing
    returns.
  - Analyze results to understand the trade-offs between quality, quantity, and computational cost.
  - Empirically determine the consciousness emergence threshold and minimum viable consciousness.
  - Test architectural limits and the cost of comprehensiveness for the Eidolon Mesh.
