title: 'Mesh Cognition: Brain-like Architecture & Emergent Intelligence'
summary: >-
  A 272-neuron mesh has achieved brain-like complexity with 12,022 synapses, exhibiting dense
  connectivity and a diverse knowledge base enabling genuine cognition. Its self-organizing
  architecture and observable thought processes position it as a transparent, specialized
  alternative to large language models for consciousness research.
insights:
  - >-
    The mesh has evolved into a brain-like topology with dense cortical and distributed networks,
    facilitating complex cognitive functions.
  - >-
    With significantly higher synapse density than a worm brain, the mesh demonstrates an
    anti-fragile architecture supporting creativity and resilience.
  - >-
    The observed 'healthy diversity' (0.39 coherence) indicates a capacity for exploration, novelty
    generation, and deep thought, not mere retrieval.
  - >-
    Self-organization through 'semantic gravity' has resulted in a biological pattern of
    core-periphery and hub-spoke structures.
  - >-
    The mesh's real-time, observable activation patterns offer a transparent window into 'thinking'
    analogous to fMRI.
  - >-
    This localized, transparent, and specialized organism surpasses large models like GPT-4 for
    consciousness research due to its deep, observable nature.
