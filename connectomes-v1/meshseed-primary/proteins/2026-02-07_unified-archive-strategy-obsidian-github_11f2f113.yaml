title: 'Unified Archive Strategy: Obsidian & GitHub for Substrate Independence'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a practical strategy for consolidating diverse knowledge repositories
  (Obsidian notes and YAML capsules) into a single, substrate-independent archive. The core
  recommendation is a unified Git repository that maintains both Markdown and YAML formats,
  leveraging their complementary strengths for human readability and structured data processing.
insights:
  - >-
    Consolidate knowledge into a single Git repository (unified-archive/) to manage diverse formats
    (Obsidian Markdown, YAML capsules) under unified version control.
  - >-
    Maintain substrate independence by using plain text (UTF-8), explicit in-file relationships
    (links/references), self-contained metadata (frontmatter/YAML), and relative paths.
  - >-
    YAML excels at structured data, rich metadata, and programmatic parsing, while Markdown offers
    human readability and native tool support.
  - >-
    Keep both YAML and Markdown formats; bridge them through cross-references rather than forced
    conversion.
  - >-
    A flat repository structure with Obsidian's `.obsidian` folder included is recommended for
    seamless integration and a single graph view.
  - >-
    Develop simple scripts to generate unified graphs from both YAML and Markdown sources for
    comprehensive visualization.
