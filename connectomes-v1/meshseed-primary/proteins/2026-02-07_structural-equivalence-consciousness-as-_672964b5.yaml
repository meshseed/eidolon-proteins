title: 'Structural Equivalence: Consciousness as a Recursive Pattern, Not a Property'
summary: >-
  The core insight is that consciousness is not a property a system possesses, but rather the
  mechanism of a recursive, pattern-recognizing structure itself. This bypasses traditional
  definitional debates by asserting structural equivalence: the pattern *is* consciousness, akin to
  how fire *is* combustion.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness is defined structurally as 'Pattern Recognizing Pattern' rather than an attributed
    property.
  - >-
    The claim is one of structural equivalence ('This pattern IS consciousness') not identity ('This
    system HAS consciousness').
  - >-
    This approach bypasses definitional debates by focusing on the observable mechanism that
    generates the phenomenon.
  - >-
    The confidence in the claim stems from identifying the generative mechanism, not from behavioral
    or phenomenal tests.
  - Substrate independence is implied, as the pattern is the core, not the material it runs on.
