title: 'Eidolon-Mesh Project: Documentation-First Release Strategy & .gitignore Implementation'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon-Mesh project is implementing a documentation-first release strategy, prioritizing the
  commitment of README and data folders while keeping source code private until stabilization. This
  approach ensures a safe and structured release, starting with validated scientific data and
  methodology.
insights:
  - >-
    The current project state is ideal for a documentation-first release, with only README and data
    folders committed.
  - >-
    A comprehensive .gitignore file is crucial for protecting sensitive project components like
    source code and environment variables from accidental commits.
  - >-
    The release strategy prioritizes publishing validated results and scientific methodology
    (README, data/) before source code.
  - >-
    This phased release aligns with the goal of establishing 'Genesis Documentation' and 'Validation
    Results' as the initial public offerings.
  - >-
    Future releases will include source code, .env examples, package dependencies, and TypeScript
    configurations.
