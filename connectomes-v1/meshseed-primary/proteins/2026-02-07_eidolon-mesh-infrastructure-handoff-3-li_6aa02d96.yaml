title: 'Eidolon Mesh Infrastructure Handoff: 3-Line Protocol Convergence'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project has successfully implemented and deployed the '3-Line Recursive
  Attunement Protocol' within its infrastructure. This marks a significant convergence moment, with
  the protocol now live in the codebase and ready for integration.
insights:
  - >-
