title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Performance & Synthesis Fixes'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v1.4 is undergoing critical fixes to improve query performance and the quality of
  synthesized knowledge. Key issues include slow initial loading, inaccurate timing, and a critical
  bug where synthesized responses lacked the full content of retrieved proteins due to a pipeline
  disconnect.
insights:
  - Initial protein loading bottlenecked queries, requiring optimization through caching.
  - >-
    Accurate timing of query execution is now displayed to users, replacing misleadingly short
    durations.
  - >-
    A critical bug prevented the synthesis module from accessing the full content of proteins,
    leading to incomplete and inaccurate responses, particularly for semantic queries like
    'emotional fidelity'.
  - >-
    The root cause was identified as a failure to load and pass the complete dialogue (DNA) content
    associated with proteins to the synthesis process.
  - >-
    Fixes involve enhancing protein loading mechanisms, caching connectome data, implementing
    accurate timing, and ensuring full dialogue content is available for synthesis.
