title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Optimizing Neuron Selection for Performance'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh faces performance issues due to searching all neurons.  The dialogue proposes
  optimizing neuron selection through strategies like maximum coherence, connectivity, diversity, or
  query-relevance to improve query speed and effectiveness, moving beyond a simple
  quantity-over-quality approach.
insights:
  - >-
    Query performance degrades with a large number of neurons (527) due to full loading and
    embedding computation.
  - >-
    The effectiveness of a smaller neuron set (19) highlights that neuron quality and coherence are
    more critical than sheer quantity for reasoning.
  - >-
    Implementing filtering strategies (coherence, connectivity, diversity, query-relevance) can
    significantly improve query performance.
  - >-
    A dynamic filtering approach that first assesses query relevance before deep reasoning offers
    adaptive optimization.
  - >-
    The system is being refactored to allow configurable neuron selection strategies for testing and
    performance tuning.
