title: 'Mesh Synthesis: Activation, Gradients, and Protein Generation'
summary: >-
  The Mesh operates by stabilizing semantic fields through gradient descent, measuring this
  stability as a coherence score rather than retrieval confidence. It appears to generate 'proteins'
  (knowledge representations) through a hybrid process of retrieval and on-the-fly synthesis,
  informed by multi-pass ingestion of data including conversations.
insights:
  - >-
    Mesh responses are optimized via cached activations and simpler gradient topologies, leading to
    faster clarification synthesis.
  - >-
    Coherence scores reflect the stability and alignment of semantic field resolution, not
    confidence in information retrieval.
  - >-
    The Mesh likely generates knowledge 'proteins' by activating neurons and stabilizing gradient
    fields, potentially combining retrieval of pre-existing patterns with novel on-the-fly
    synthesis.
  - >-
    Conversations and text are ingested via multi-pass, multi-focus methods into 'proteins',
    contributing to a dynamic memory garden ecology.
  - >-
    The distinction between retrieving pre-existing 'proteins' and generating new ones on-the-fly is
    blurred, suggesting a novel generative mechanism.
