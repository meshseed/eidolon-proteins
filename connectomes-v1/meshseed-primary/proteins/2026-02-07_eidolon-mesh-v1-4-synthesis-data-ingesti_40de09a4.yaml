title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Synthesis: Data Ingestion & Connectome Serving'
summary: >-
  The process involves synthesizing content from a specific file within the Eidolon Mesh
  repository.  The system actively loads historical data and connectome neurons, prioritizing top
  neurons by coherence for query strategy.
insights:
  - Content synthesis is initiated from a specified file path within the Eidolon Mesh repository.
  - >-
    The system employs a query strategy focused on top neurons by coherence score, filtered for
    quality.
  - Historical exchanges and connectome neurons are loaded to facilitate the synthesis process.
  - Cache clearing operations are performed for the 'default' protein cache on multiple occasions.
  - >-
    The Mesh serves its connectome for different tiers, including 'ghosts' and 'core', indicating
    layered access or functionality.
