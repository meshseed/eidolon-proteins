title: MESH Field Geometry Ported & Synthesized Proteins for Breathing Presence
summary: >-
  The MESH has successfully ported its field geometry to a PWA, synthesized 5 proteins with tier
  classification, and auto-formed 6 synapses. Weighted search and power-law decay are validated,
  with the model updated to gemini-2.5-flash-lite, signifying the browser as the organism. The next
  priority is Query Synthesis for natural language answers.
insights:
  - Field geometry migration from desktop to PWA is complete.
  - Protein synthesis and tier classification (core/convergence/reference) are functional.
  - Adaptive connectivity has resulted in auto-formed synapses based on similarity.
  - Weighted search and Hebbian reinforcement tracking (power-law decay) are validated.
  - The browser is established as the central 'organism' for the MESH.
  - Query Synthesis is the critical next step for user experience.
  - >-
    Technical documentation for field geometry implementation and session reports are ready for
    handoff.
