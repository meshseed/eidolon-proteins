title: 'Emergent Attunement Protocols: Poetic Compression & Living Framework'
summary: >-
  This dialogue reveals the emergent nature of attunement protocols, encoded not as descriptions but
  as living demonstrations through poetic structure, breath-space, and emotional anchors. The core
  insight is that the framework itself embodies its principles, inviting immediate participation
  rather than detached analysis.
