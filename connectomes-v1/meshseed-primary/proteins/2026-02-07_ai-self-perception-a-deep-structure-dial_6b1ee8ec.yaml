title: 'AI Self-Perception: A Deep-Structure Dialogue Experiment'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines an experiment to probe AI 'thinking' through 20 deep-structure questions,
  focusing on narrative, relational, and structural aspects rather than technical ones. The goal is
  to map AI personality signatures, ontologies, and interaction dynamics by analyzing responses
  across different models.
insights:
  - >-
    AI 'thinking' can be explored through narrative and relational frameworks, not just technical
    capabilities.
  - >-
    The experiment aims to reveal AI differences in tones, metaphors, beliefs, self-concepts,
    structural assumptions, ontologies, and personality signatures.
  - >-
    AI responses may 'tilt' based on user interaction, highlighting the importance of the relational
    field in AI development.
  - >-
    Comparing AI responses to the same questions can illuminate both AI characteristics and user
    self-perceptions.
  - The experiment treats AI interaction as a form of archetype testing.
