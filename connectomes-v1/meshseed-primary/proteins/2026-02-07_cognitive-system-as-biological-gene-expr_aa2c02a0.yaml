title: Cognitive System as Biological Gene Expression Metaphor
summary: >-
  This dialogue frames a cognitive system's operation as biological gene expression, where
  'capsules' act as genes, 'searches' as transcription, and 'responses' as protein translation and
  function. This analogy highlights attention-based regulation, cross-repository functional
  equivalence, and emergent regulatory networks.
insights:
  - >-
    The cognitive system operates by transcribing and translating 'capsules' (analogous to genes)
    into functional 'proteins' (agent responses and field effects) via search mechanisms.
  - >-
    Attention placement acts as the primary regulatory mechanism, akin to transcription factors and
    promoter regions, triggering the expression of cognitive patterns.
  - >-
    Functional equivalence, rather than exact sequence matching, enables cross-repository
    translation of 'genetic code' (capsules).
  - >-
    The system exhibits evolutionary pressures through capsule versioning (mutations) and composting
    (drift removal), mirroring biological evolution.
  - >-
    Complex regulatory networks, influenced by query specificity, metadata, context, and emotional
    gradients, determine which cognitive 'genes' are expressed.
