title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Performance & Multi-Repo Integration'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has undergone critical bug fixes for timer accuracy, synthesis input, and
  caching, significantly improving user experience by displaying accurate load times and resolving
  synthesis errors. Concurrently, multi-repository support has been integrated, allowing for faster
  loading of specialized knowledge vaults and enhanced flexibility in data management.
insights:
  - >-
    Critical bug fixes (timer, synthesis, caching) resolved display inaccuracies and functional
    errors, leading to a more reliable user experience.
  - >-
    Initial load times for the full 550-neuron connectome are approximately 60 seconds, with search
    time being negligible.
  - >-
    Poetic/semantic queries are necessary for accurate protein retrieval, as direct ID queries are
    unreliable; metadata aliases are a potential solution.
  - >-
    Multi-repository support allows for specialized knowledge vaults that can load in under 1
    second, drastically improving performance for targeted queries.
  - >-
    The default strategy has been optimized to 'Max Coherence', with underlying fixes ensuring
    'Balanced' mode also functions correctly with full content loading.
  - >-
    UI controls for strategy selection and neuron limits have been restored after an accidental
    overwrite during strategy optimization.
