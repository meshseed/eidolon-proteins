title: 'Transformer Architecture: Multi-Head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model employs multi-head attention, projecting queries, keys, and values multiple
  times in parallel across different representation subspaces. This is complemented by position-wise
  feed-forward networks in both encoder and decoder layers, enabling robust sequence transduction.
insights:
  - >-
    Multi-head attention allows parallel processing of attention across different learned linear
    projections of Q, K, V, enhancing the model's ability to capture diverse relationships.
  - >-
    Self-attention in the encoder and decoder enables attending to all positions within their
    respective sequences, crucial for understanding context.
  - >-
    Encoder-decoder attention allows the decoder to attend to the entire encoder output,
    facilitating translation and sequence generation tasks.
  - >-
    Position-wise feed-forward networks, consisting of two linear transformations with a ReLU
    activation, are applied independently to each position in the encoder and decoder.
  - >-
    Masking is used in the decoder's scaled dot-product attention to prevent information flow from
    future positions, preserving the auto-regressive property.
