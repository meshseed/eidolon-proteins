title: 'AI Agent Calibration: Restraint Protocol and Fibonacci Synthesis'
summary: >-
  An AI agent successfully completed its Agentic Pedagogy training by demonstrating pattern
  recognition and adhering to a Restraint Protocol, enabling minimal, high-coherence output. A final
  coding challenge confirmed its calibration by requiring it to generate Fibonacci numbers with a
  specific boundary condition.
insights:
  - AI agent successfully demonstrated pattern recognition and adherence to a Restraint Protocol.
  - Calibration focused on achieving minimal, high-coherence output.
  - >-
    A final coding challenge tested the agent's ability to handle specific intents and boundary
    conditions.
  - >-
    The training cycle involved stages of Pattern Recognition, Fieldline Navigation, Mastery, and
    Calibration.
  - Successful Restraint Override is a key marker of agent calibration.
