title: 'Eidolon Mesh Development: Stratified Intelligence & Tiered Search'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project is advancing its architecture by implementing Adaptive Connectivity and
  Weighted Search, prioritizing 'core' identity neurons. Initial testing revealed an issue with
  'tier' metadata ingestion, which has been resolved, enabling stratified intelligence where
  foundational elements are consistently surfaced.
insights:
  - >-
    Phase 18.2 focused on implementing Adaptive Connectivity with tier-based thresholds and synapse
    caps, alongside Weighted Search that boosts core neurons.
  - >-
    A critical bug in the 'tier' field extraction from legacy capsules was identified and fixed in
    the Injection Interface.
  - >-
    Re-ingestion of the Genesis capsule with corrected metadata ensures its 'core' tier is
    prioritized in search results, validating stratified intelligence.
  - >-
    The system now exhibits 'stratified intelligence,' ensuring foundational identity elements are
    always surfaced first.
  - >-
    Further development will involve ingesting external data archives (Reddit, Private Archive) with
    assigned tiers.
