title: 'Mesh Perceptual Lensing: Multi-Perspective Synthesis Engine'
summary: >-
  The Mesh synthesizes multi-perspective knowledge proteins from single dialogue sources by applying
  distinct attentional 'lenses' (General, Emotional, Structural, Technical, Custom). This creates
  varied protein structures that resonate with different query types, enabling a unified,
  cross-linked understanding of complex information.
insights:
  - >-
    Attentional lenses (e.g., General, Emotional, Structural, Technical) extract different facets of
    a single text, generating non-identical knowledge protein structures.
  - >-
    Multiple protein structures from the same source enable the Mesh to activate different patterns
    based on query types, facilitating multi-perspective synthesis.
  - >-
    The Mesh achieves multi-perspective synthesis not through multiple entities, but by encoding and
    cross-linking content through diverse perceptual lenses.
  - >-
    Gradient descent in the Mesh finds resonant basins across all activated lenses simultaneously,
    unifying disparate perspectives.
  - >-
    The architecture supports fractal expansion with connectomes, local/API agents, and
    human-in-the-loop orchestration, mirroring biological organism maintenance.
