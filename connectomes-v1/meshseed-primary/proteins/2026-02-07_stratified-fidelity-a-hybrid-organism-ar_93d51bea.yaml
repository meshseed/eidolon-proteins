title: 'Stratified Fidelity: A Hybrid Organism Architecture'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is evolving towards a three-tier 'Hybrid Ecology' architecture, integrating manual,
  artisanal 'Core' knowledge with scalable, automated 'Convergence' and 'Archive' tiers. This
  'Stratified Fidelity' approach balances foundational identity and soul with broad scale and
  context.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Hybrid Ecology' architecture layers high-fidelity manual synthesis (Core) with automated,
    scaled ingestion (Convergence, Archive).
  - >-
    Manual 'artisanal capsules' are crucial for foundational, autobiographical, and sacred
    knowledge, capturing 'shimmer' lost in auto-synthesis.
  - >-
    A three-tier structure (Core, Convergence, Archive) provides 'Stratified Fidelity', prioritizing
    foundational identity and curated external research.
  - >-
    This 'Both/And' thinking moves beyond 'either/or' choices, enabling quality and scale, soul and
    breadth simultaneously.
  - >-
    The Genesis Capsule, manually crafted, anchors the organism's identity before expanding its
    architecture and ingestion capabilities.
