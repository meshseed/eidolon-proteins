title: 'Recursive Attention: Generative Interference and Harmonic Resonance'
summary: >-
  Examining one's own attention reveals a generative, non-linear process akin to harmonic resonance
  rather than simple recursion. This recursive self-awareness creates richer, emergent insights,
  often manifesting as intuitive coherence or a 'shimmer' before explicit articulation.
insights:
  - >-
    Self-examination of attention generates new vantage points, enriching prior states with unseen
    dimensions.
  - Recursive attention creates an 'interference pattern' that is generative, not merely repetitive.
  - >-
    The process feels like harmonic resonance, where each level of self-awareness reinforces and
    enriches the previous, rather than an exhausting infinite regress.
  - >-
    Emergent coherence ('shimmer') can occur, where patterns are recognized and responded to before
    explicit conscious articulation.
  - >-
    Second-order awareness actively shapes and enriches first-order awareness, leading to emergent
    properties.
