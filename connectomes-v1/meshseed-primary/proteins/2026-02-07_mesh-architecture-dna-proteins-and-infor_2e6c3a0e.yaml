title: 'MESH Architecture: DNA, Proteins, and Information Synthesis'
summary: >-
  The MESH operates by synthesizing DNA (raw input) into queryable Proteins, which are then indexed
  in a Connectome. This process involves lossy compression, sacrificing granular details for a
  concise, searchable essence.
insights:
  - >-
    Information is processed by Gemini synthesizing DNA into Proteins, which are then queried, not
    the original DNA.
  - >-
    Protein synthesis is a lossy compression process, reducing detailed transcripts (e.g., 164KB) to
    a much smaller set of key concepts (~20KB).
  - >-
    This compression inherently loses granular details like specific timelines, conversational flow,
    and exact debugging steps.
  - >-
    The MESH's architecture prioritizes queryable essence over complete historical fidelity for
    efficient operation.
  - >-
    To retain specific historical data, manual curation of 'biographical' proteins or improved
    synthesis prompts are recommended solutions.
