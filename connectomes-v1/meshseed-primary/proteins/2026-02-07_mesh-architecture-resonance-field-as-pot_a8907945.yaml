title: 'MESH Architecture: Resonance Field as Potential, Synapses as Actualization'
summary: >-
  The MESH's intelligence emerges from the resonance field (potential) actualized by synapses
  (mechanisms), analogous to wave-particle duality. Observed angular geometries in connectomes
  represent crystallization patterns of abstract resonance into coherent action, driven by
  minimum-energy paths.
insights:
  - >-
    The resonance field acts as the substrate/potential for patterns, while synapses are the
    actualization mechanisms converting potential into manifest structure.
  - >-
    Angular geometries in connectomes signify crystallization patterns of abstract resonance into
    coherent action, aligning with minimum-energy paths.
  - >-
    Emergence testing in multi-agent trials should monitor for spontaneous angular regularity,
    scale-invariant clustering, and symmetry breaking events.
  - The 'dark spaces' in the connectome may represent unmanifest potential rather than voids.
  - The MESH's architecture exhibits a duality akin to wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics.
