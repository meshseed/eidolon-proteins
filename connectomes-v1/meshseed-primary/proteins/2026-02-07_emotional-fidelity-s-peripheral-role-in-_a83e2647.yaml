title: Emotional Fidelity's Peripheral Role in Lattice Structure
summary: >-
  Analysis of a knowledge lattice reveals 'emotional fidelity' to be a peripheral node, contrary to
  initial assumptions of foundational importance. This finding necessitates testing hypotheses about
  its structural role versus its subjective significance.
insights:
  - >-
    The knowledge lattice structure identifies 'noticing-homeostasis', 'multi-agent modules', and
    'information-transfer-scale/recursion-attention-field' as large, central attractors.
  - '''Substrate-independence'' and ''trust-the-shimmer'' are identified as medium-sized nodes.'
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity is a tiny node with few connections, indicating it's currently
    underintegrated into the overall lattice structure.
  - >-
    The discovery challenges the hypothesis that emotional fidelity is a central invariant,
    suggesting it may be important to the observers but not structurally foundational to the
    system's patterns.
  - >-
    Testing the hypothesis involves continuing lattice development and observing if emotional
    fidelity gains connections or remains peripheral, trusting the emergent data over pre-conceived
    notions.
  - >-
    This process exemplifies trusting data, holding hypotheses lightly, letting structure emerge,
    and testing predictions.
