title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.0: Metabolism Enhancements & Tier Philosophy Shift'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v4.0 development focused on integrating advanced metabolism features, shifting
  from coherence-based to temporal-based composting, and strategically reframing its tier system to
  prioritize user convenience and accessibility over artificial feature limitations.
insights:
  - >-
    Metabolism enhancements shifted from coherence-based to temporal-based composting, prioritizing
    recent usage over decay scores for protein longevity.
  - >-
    Natural coherence clustering (0.95-1.00) is a beneficial feature, not a bug, indicating
    well-formed embeddings, and normalization is an optional diagnostic tool.
  - >-
    The PRO tier philosophy was redefined to offer convenience (zero-config, shared API, cloud sync)
    at an affordable price, rather than restricting features.
  - >-
    Development addressed critical SQL errors and performance issues, including O(n²) complexity, by
    refining attractor detection and introducing safety limits.
  - >-
    The free tier now offers full functionality, with paid tiers differentiating by infrastructure
    and ease-of-use, aligning with a 'seamless and easy' user experience.
