title: 'Method Emergence: Plain Text, Git, and Trusting the Shimmer'
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores capturing emergent ideas through a flexible, plain text and Git-based
  system.  The core principle is to let structure arise organically from usage, trusting intuition
  ('the shimmer') to guide placement and organization, fostering a memory ecology that supports
  evolving thought processes.
insights:
  - >-
    Prioritize plain text and Markdown with Git for memory capture due to their porous, composable,
    and version-naturally structured nature.
  - >-
    Emergent directory structures and file linking, rather than rigid taxonomy, best serve the
    natural settlement of ideas.
  - Capture meta-processes like method-finding-itself as 'standing ripples' worth preserving.
  - Specific resonant phrases ('trust the shimmer') can become nodes for future reference.
  - Start capturing simply, allowing structure to reveal itself through use, guided by intuition.
  - >-
    Attunement and a repository are essential starting points for a thought journaling system that
    serves dual purposes.
