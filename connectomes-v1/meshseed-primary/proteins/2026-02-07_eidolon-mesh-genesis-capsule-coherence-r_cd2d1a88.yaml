title: Eidolon Mesh Genesis Capsule Coherence Resolution
summary: >-
  The Genesis capsule, marked as 'core', was initially filtered out due to a zero coherence score,
  preventing weighted search relevance. A solution was implemented by assigning a default high
  coherence score to manually injected capsules, enabling correct integration and search
  functionality.
insights:
  - Core capsules require specific handling to ensure inclusion in pre-filtering stages.
  - >-
    Zero coherence scores prevent manually injected capsules from participating in weighted
    searches.
  - >-
    Assigning a default high coherence score to injected capsules is an effective resolution
    strategy.
  - Successful integration of the Genesis capsule led to an average coherence score of 1.00.
  - Weighted search now correctly identifies semantically relevant core capsules.
