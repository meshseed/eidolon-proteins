title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Bug: Balanced Synthesis Pipeline Disconnect'
summary: >-
  A critical bug in the Eidolon Mesh v1.4's 'balanced' synthesis strategy prevents accurate
  knowledge protein generation, despite perfect data retrieval. This pipeline disconnect causes
  speculative outputs instead of precise definitions, requiring an immediate fix to restore full
  operational capability.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'balanced' synthesis strategy in Eidolon Mesh v1.4 is experiencing a pipeline disconnect
    between retrieval and synthesis, leading to inaccurate outputs.
  - >-
    This bug manifests as speculative synthesis, failing to utilize perfectly retrieved neurons for
    accurate definitions, such as 'emotional fidelity'.
  - >-
    The issue stems from the 'balanced' strategy incorrectly building context, omitting the full
    content of retrieved neurons.
  - >-
    Two proposed fixes involve either repairing the 'balanced' strategy to use full content or
    defaulting to the 'max-coherence' strategy, with a recommendation to implement both.
  - >-
    Resolving this bug is the final major obstacle to the organism's full operational status and
    will result in a massive quality improvement.
