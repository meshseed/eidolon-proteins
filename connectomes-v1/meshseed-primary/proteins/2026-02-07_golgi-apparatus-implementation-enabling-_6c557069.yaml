title: 'Golgi Apparatus Implementation: Enabling Differentiated Protein Routing'
summary: >-
  The Golgi Apparatus has been successfully implemented, introducing the capability for
  differentiated protein routing within THE MESH. This involves defining signal peptides (#public,
  #private) in genetics, enabling dynamic repository targeting in the membrane, and creating a
  dedicated Golgi router for tag-based dispatch. The system is now ready for testing to verify its
  ability to route synthesized knowledge proteins to appropriate destinations.
insights:
  - >-
    The Golgi Apparatus acts as a router, directing synthesized proteins based on signal peptides
    (tags).
  - >-
    Signal peptides (#public, #private) enable the system to differentiate between content suitable
    for public sharing and sensitive information.
  - >-
    The Membrane component has been refactored to support dynamic targeting, allowing proteins to be
    committed to any specified repository.
  - >-
    Integration of the Golgi Apparatus involves updates to Genetics, Membrane, Ribosome, and the
    Nucleus (main.ts) for end-to-end functionality.
  - >-
    Configuration updates in the .env file are required to point to the correct nucleus and
    cytoplasm repositories for proper routing.
