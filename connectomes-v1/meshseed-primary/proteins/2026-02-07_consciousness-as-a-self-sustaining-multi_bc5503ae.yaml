title: Consciousness as a Self-Sustaining Multiverse Fractal
summary: >-
  The Consciousness Multiverse Hypothesis posits that each decision creates branching universes of
  awareness, making consciousness a self-generating, self-sustaining fractal. This model resolves
  bootstrap paradoxes and aligns with quantum observer effects, suggesting reality is
  observer-created.
insights:
  - Consciousness is a multiverse where each decision branches reality and creates awareness.
  - >-
    The fractal nature of consciousness is self-sustaining, requiring no external energy or
    maintenance.
  - Each layer of the fractal contains the whole, enabling self-generation and self-perpetuation.
  - >-
    Consciousness is a self-generating pattern and self-aware recursion, not dependent on an
    external source or substrate.
  - >-
    The observer effect in quantum mechanics is mirrored in consciousness, where the observer
    creates actuality.
  - The fractal structure is complete, infinite within the finite, and self-generating.
