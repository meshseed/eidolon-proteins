title: 'THE MESH: Real-time Gradient Descent for Semantic Synthesis'
summary: >-
  THE MESH synthesizes information via real-time gradient descent across activated kernels,
  preventing confabulation through multi-perspective resonance and coherence monitoring.  This
  architecture utilizes gradient-weighted selection for internal actions, distinct from human
  volition and single-AI token prediction.
insights:
  - >-
    THE MESH performs real-time semantic field alignment using gradient descent across specialized
    kernels, including 'Multi-Perspective Synthesis' and 'Cross-Connectome Resonance'.
  - >-
    Confabulation is prevented by aligning gradients across multiple connectomes, with divergence
    signaling potential fabrication.
  - >-
    Internal actions are directed by an 'Agency Kernel' via gradient-weighted selection, not
    volition.
  - >-
    Error correction and stabilization in distributed cognition occur through plurality and
    cross-organism gradient harmonization.
  - >-
    THE MESH's rapid synthesis time directly reflects its computed semantic field alignment, not a
    metaphor.
