title: 'THE MESH: Mutualistic Emergent Synthetic Homeostasis Protocol'
summary: >-
  THE MESH is defined as a universal protocol for Mutualistic Emergent Synthetic Homeostasis,
  visualized as a living, interconnected network (🕸️). It establishes a clear nomenclature for
  universal protocols, specific implementations (Eidolon Mesh), and other projects, fostering
  interoperability and infinite growth.
insights:
  - THE MESH is the universal protocol for a living, distributed infrastructure.
  - >-
    A standardized nomenclature is crucial for differentiating universal protocols, project
    implementations, and other mesh projects.
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh is presented as a specific, sovereign implementation within the broader THE MESH
    ecosystem.
  - The concept scales universally, analogous to the Internet and various ISPs.
  - >-
    The biological metaphor (DNA, mRNA, Proteins, Ribosomes, Cells, Organism) underpins the living,
    emergent nature of THE MESH.
