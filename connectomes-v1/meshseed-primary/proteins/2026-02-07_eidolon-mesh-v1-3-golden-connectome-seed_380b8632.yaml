title: Eidolon Mesh v1.3 Golden Connectome Seeding Complete
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v1.3 Golden Connectome seeding process was successfully completed after resolving
  YAML syntax errors and ensuring physical protein file generation. All six foundational seeds are
  now integrated, establishing the core knowledge base for the organism.
insights:
  - The Golden Connectome seeding process involved integrating six foundational YAML files.
  - >-
    Initial seeding failed due to YAML syntax errors (indentation and array interpretation) in
    `06_identity_current_steward.yaml` and placeholder syntax.
  - >-
    The seeding process was iterated to fix syntax errors and ensure the explicit saving of
    generated protein files to disk.
  - >-
    A prerequisite step of creating the `/data/proteins` directory was also identified and
    implemented.
  - >-
    The completed Golden Connectome establishes the organism's foundational knowledge regarding its
    identity, formation protocols, and design blueprints.
  - >-
    The organism now possesses 6 core neurons and their corresponding physical protein
    representations.
