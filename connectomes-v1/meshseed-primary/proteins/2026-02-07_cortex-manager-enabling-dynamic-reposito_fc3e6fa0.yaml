title: 'Cortex Manager: Enabling Dynamic Repository Switching for Personal Mesh'
summary: >-
  Phase 19 introduces the 'Cortex Manager' to enable seamless switching between different knowledge
  repositories (lobes) via a UI, moving from static configuration to dynamic, user-friendly domain
  exploration. This lays the groundwork for future parallel processing and cross-domain synthesis
  within the Personal Mesh.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Cortex Manager' UI allows users to switch active knowledge repositories ('lobes') without
    server restarts, enabling dynamic domain specialization.
  - >-
    Phase 19 focuses on single repository switching, with future phases enabling concurrent querying
    for 'Mesh of Meshes' functionality.
  - >-
    The architecture evolves from static, restart-dependent configuration to dynamic, user-friendly,
    frictionless exploration of diverse domains.
  - >-
    Repository metadata (display names, icons, descriptions) is crucial for rich UI presentation and
    user understanding.
  - >-
    Implementation includes backend API endpoints for listing and switching repos, and frontend
    elements for selection and visual feedback.
  - >-
    Thorough verification plans, including edge case considerations, ensure robustness and prepare
    for future multi-repository features.
