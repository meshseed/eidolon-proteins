title: 'Eidolon-Mesh: Hybrid Knowledge Synthesis for Core Identity'
summary: >-
  The dialogue reveals a return to artisanal, manually crafted YAML capsules for core
  autobiographical knowledge, recognizing that high-volume auto-synthesis by LLMs loses crucial
  detail and emotional fidelity. A hybrid architecture combining manual depth for core identity with
  automated breadth for peripheral information is essential for a complete knowledge system.
insights:
  - Organisms query proteins, not DNA; proteins are compressed synthesis losing details.
  - >-
    Auto-synthesis (LLMs) provides high volume but low fidelity, losing nuance, emotional gradients,
    and ritual structure.
  - >-
    Manual YAML capsules offer high fidelity, emotional encoding, and ritualized structure but lack
    scalability.
  - >-
    A hybrid architecture is necessary: manual capsules for core identity/autobiography (depth) and
    auto-synthesis for broad information (breadth).
  - >-
    Contributor gradients and breath types are critical metadata lost in auto-synthesis, preserving
    the phenomenology of discovery and knowledge context.
  - >-
    Genesis autobiography should be a Tier 1 artisanal capsule, not auto-synthesized, to honor its
    foundational nature and emotional fidelity.
