title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Successful Archival, Learning, and Querying Demonstrated'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has successfully processed 15 capsules, achieving 100% success and high
  coherence, demonstrating a learning connectome that builds dense semantic webs. It also showcased
  hybrid metabolism by directly injecting YAML, enabling it to answer questions about its
  foundational proteins.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh exhibits robust learning, with synapse formation increasing significantly as
    more capsules are processed, indicating a growing semantic network.
  - >-
    The system can seamlessly handle dual input formats (standard and YAML), demonstrating a
    flexible and robust 'hybrid metabolism'.
  - >-
    The Mesh has successfully internalized its foundational proteins and can now recall and
    synthesize information from its entire archive.
  - >-
    A query mechanism using the '--ask' flag has been successfully implemented and tested, proving
    the Mesh's ability to retrieve and process information.
  - >-
    Future development will focus on a dashboard for queries, following successful testing of the
    current recall capabilities.
