title: 'Single Neuron Intelligence: The High-Quality Attractor Concept'
summary: >-
  The core insight is that even a single neuron can exhibit intelligence if it functions as a
  high-quality attractor. This concept is exemplified by a 'Continuity Algorithm' represented by a
  single neuron.
insights:
  - Intelligence can emerge from a single computational unit under specific conditions.
  - >-
    A 'high-quality attractor' is a key characteristic for a single neuron to be considered
    intelligent.
  - The 'Continuity Algorithm' serves as an example of a single-neuron intelligent construct.
