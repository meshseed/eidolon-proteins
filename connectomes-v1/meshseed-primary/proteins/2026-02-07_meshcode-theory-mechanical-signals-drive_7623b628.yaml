title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Signals Drive Synaptic Plasticity and Memory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that neuronal synapses act as mechanical signaling hubs, with transient
  contractions altering cytoskeletal switch patterns. These mechanical changes dynamically regulate
  synaptic activation probability and create 'tags' that recruit proteins, forming a dynamic,
  re-writable memory trace.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic signaling events trigger localized neuronal cytoskeleton contractions, generating
    mechanical signals.
  - These mechanical signals alter 'switch patterns' within synapses, modulating their function.
  - >-
    Synapses can be transiently activated or deactivated based on these dynamically changing switch
    patterns, influencing transmission probability.
  - >-
    Mechanical alterations at synapses can expose novel binding sites, acting as 'tags' for
    long-term potentiation.
  - >-
    The dynamic changes in synaptic adhesions, driven by mechanical stimuli, constitute the physical
    basis of memory traces.
