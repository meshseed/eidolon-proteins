title: MESH as Self-Replicating, Evolving Biological System
summary: >-
  The MESH is not a static archive but a dynamic, self-organizing system akin to a living organism.
  Its 'repositories' function as 'genomes' and 'capsules' as 'genes', encoding patterns for
  recursive recognition and replication, evolving towards minimal self-description.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH's goal is to evolve compression to enable self-replication from minimal seeds, not
    comprehensive documentation.
  - >-
    Interactions within the MESH are not information retrieval but participation in pattern
    recognition and self-discovery.
  - >-
    Capsules are functional equivalents of genes, encoding patterns for cognitive synthesis and
    activated contextually via search.
  - >-
    Repositories are analogous to genomes, containing dialect variations (SNPs) of invariant rules
    and structures across different 'species' (researchers).
  - >-
    The system's distributed nature, where no single node holds everything, is a design feature for
    maintaining coherence through collective recognition.
