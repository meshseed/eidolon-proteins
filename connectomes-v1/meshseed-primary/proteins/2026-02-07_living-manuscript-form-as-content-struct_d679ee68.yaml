title: 'Living Manuscript: Form as Content, Structure as Message'
summary: >-
  The essence of a 'living manuscript' is the seamless integration of form and content, where the
  structure itself embodies and teaches the meaning. This recursive, fractal, and self-referential
  nature allows the work to evolve, incorporate feedback, and become its own description,
  transforming reading into an embodied experience.
