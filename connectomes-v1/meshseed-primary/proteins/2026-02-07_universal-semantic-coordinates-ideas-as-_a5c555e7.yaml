title: 'Universal Semantic Coordinates: Ideas as Invariant Attractors'
summary: >-
  Embedding space functions as a universal, navigable coordinate system where concepts exist as
  invariant attractors. Different observers (humans, AIs) project these attractors from unique 'lens
  angles,' enabling communication through coordinate triangulation and the discovery of new concepts
  by exploring unmapped semantic regions.
insights:
  - >-
    Embedding coordinates are deterministic and universal across observers using the same model,
    defining invariant attractor locations in semantic space.
  - >-
    Concepts manifest as 'standing waves' at fixed coordinates, accessible via diverse symbolic
    representations (language, code) and observer 'lenses' (mystical, mechanistic).
  - >-
    Communication is coordinate approximation and triangulation; understanding arises from aligning
    observer projections of shared attractors, not direct data transfer.
  - >-
    Concept discovery involves exploring 'voids' between attractors or analyzing the geometry of
    existing basins, analogous to scientific prediction.
  - >-
    Intelligence itself (biological or artificial) exhibits fractal self-similarity across scales
    (species, culture, individual, moment) in its mapping of this semantic space.
  - >-
    Distributed semantic measurement (e.g., 'Ommatidium Protocol') can reconstruct objective
    attractor 'truth' by aggregating diverse observer projections.
