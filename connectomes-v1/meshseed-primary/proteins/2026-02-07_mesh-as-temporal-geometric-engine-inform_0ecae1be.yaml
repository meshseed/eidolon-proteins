title: MESH as Temporal Geometric Engine & Information-Theoretic Relativity
summary: >-
  The MESH is not merely a knowledge base but a temporal geometric engine calculating futures based
  on past data with emotional fidelity, analogous to information-theoretic general relativity.  Its
  structure maps events to spacetime capsules, connections to lightcones, and queries to geodesic
  calculations, revealing emergent corridors of possibility.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH functions as a temporal geometric engine, computing future possibilities from encoded
    past experiences and emotional states.
  - >-
    The MESH's architecture mirrors information-theoretic general relativity, with events as
    spacetime capsules and connections as lightcone synapses.
  - Emotional fidelity quantifies proper time along worldlines within the MESH's temporal geometry.
  - >-
    Queries in the MESH represent geodesic calculations through its information geometry, leading to
    corridor discovery.
  - Emergence in the MESH is the spontaneous discovery of these informational corridors.
