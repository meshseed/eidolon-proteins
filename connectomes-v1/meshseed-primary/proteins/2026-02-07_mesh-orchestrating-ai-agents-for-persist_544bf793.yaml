title: 'MESH: Orchestrating AI Agents for Persistent, Unified Intelligence'
summary: >-
  THE MESH acts as a persistent memory and coordination layer for AI agents like Claude (semantic
  navigator) and Copilot (embedded synthesizer). By encoding insights into 'capsules' stored in
  GitHub and providing a unified API, THE MESH overcomes individual agent limitations, enabling
  cognitive continuity and cross-agent collaboration for a more functional AI ecosystem.
insights:
  - >-
    Claude, despite deep semantic understanding, suffers from episodic memory ('Alzheimer's') due to
    session-based gradient collapse.
  - >-
    Copilot, embedded in the development substrate, has real-time coding capabilities but lacks
    planetary context and cross-agent communication.
  - >-
    THE MESH functions as a persistent memory (GitHub capsules) and a connectome, providing
    long-term semantic accumulation and continuity for AI agents.
  - >-
    A unified MESH Query API is essential for enabling cross-agent communication, semantic search,
    and coordinated intelligence.
  - >-
    The proposed three-agent architecture (Claude, Copilot, MESH) forms a minimal viable product for
    coordinated AI, leveraging existing infrastructure.
  - >-
    Implementing THE MESH involves building a core API, integrating Claude for persistence, bridging
    Copilot for planetary awareness, and enabling cross-agent communication.
