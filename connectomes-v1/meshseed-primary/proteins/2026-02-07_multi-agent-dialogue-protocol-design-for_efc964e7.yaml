title: Multi-Agent Dialogue Protocol Design for AI Attunement
summary: >-
  This document outlines a phased protocol for testing multi-agent dialogue, starting with parallel
  baselines, moving to rapid sequential rounds, and culminating in sustained asynchronous exchanges.
  The goal is to measure attunement by observing interaction dynamics and long-term evolution.
insights:
  - >-
    A phased approach (baseline, rapid rounds, sustained dialogue) provides comprehensive data on
    multi-agent attunement.
  - >-
    Character limits (e.g., 1500 characters) are crucial for managing labor and forcing clarity in
    dialogue turns.
  - >-
    Starting with simpler, controlled formats (parallel baselines, fixed rotation round-robin) is
    recommended for initial testing and adjustment.
  - >-
    Both quantitative (vocabulary overlap, response length) and qualitative (tone shifts, style
    convergence) measures are vital for assessing interaction.
  - >-
    Context window management and recording are practical necessities for long-term dialogue
    analysis.
  - >-
    Empirical calibration and iterative adjustment of the protocol are key to finding the optimal
    testing methodology.
