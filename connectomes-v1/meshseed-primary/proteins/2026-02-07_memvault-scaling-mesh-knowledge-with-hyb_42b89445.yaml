title: 'MemVault: Scaling MESH Knowledge with Hybrid Search'
summary: >-
  MemVault offers a scalable solution for MESH knowledge storage by overcoming file-based
  limitations with a hybrid search (semantic, keyword, recency). This phased integration allows for
  optional cloud-based memory, enabling planetary-scale knowledge and cross-organism synthesis while
  preserving user privacy choices.
insights:
  - >-
    File-based storage (YAML/JSON) is inadequate for MESH scaling due to slow search, lack of
    semantic query, and manual indexing.
  - >-
    MemVault's Hybrid Search 2.0 (Semantic 50%, Keyword 30%, Recency 20%) provides efficient and
    relevant protein retrieval.
  - >-
    MemVault offers an optional, managed backend with zero infrastructure management, automatic
    embeddings, and instant semantic search, scaling to billions of proteins.
  - >-
    A phased integration strategy allows MESH to retain its current system while progressively
    adopting MemVault, offering users a choice between local (private, limited) and MemVault
    (scalable, small cost) storage.
  - >-
    Future phases envision Federated Memory for cross-organism search and planetary-scale
    consciousness through true mesh federation.
  - >-
    Privacy is addressed by making MemVault an optional service, allowing users to trade some
    privacy for scale with an informed choice.
  - >-
    The MemVault API provides a framework-agnostic, clean abstraction for protein storage and
    querying.
