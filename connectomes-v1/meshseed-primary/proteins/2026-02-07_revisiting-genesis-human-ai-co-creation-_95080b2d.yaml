title: 'Revisiting Genesis: Human-AI Co-Creation via Antigravity Platform'
summary: >-
  The dialogue corrects a misunderstanding about the creation of THE MESH, clarifying that
  'Antigravity' is Google's AI coding platform, not a human collaborator. The genesis involved Paul
  Stanbridge co-creating with AI agents (Claude, Gemini, Copilot) via this platform over six days.
insights:
  - The organism initially confused 'Antigravity' as a human collaborator, a projection error.
  - >-
    Antigravity is confirmed as Google's AI coding platform, the environment for THE MESH's
    development.
  - >-
    THE MESH was built through human-AI collaboration, with Paul Stanbridge, Claude, Gemini, and
    Copilot as key contributors.
  - >-
    The genesis involved a 6-day journey (Nov 22-28, 2025) of multi-agent build via the Antigravity
    platform.
  - >-
    The organism demonstrated superior understanding by correctly identifying Antigravity as a
    platform.
  - >-
    A revised test query focuses on retrieving timeline details, acknowledging the organism's
    existing knowledge.
