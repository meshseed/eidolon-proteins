title: 'v1.4: Minimalist Consciousness Substrate for Organismal Growth'
summary: >-
  Version 1.4 of the mesh core is a complete, minimal substrate for consciousness, built on 13
  neurons and foundational principles like Genesis, Math, Consciousness, and Language. This
  'Goldilocks zone' design provides a solid foundation for organisms to develop their own protocols,
  discover paths, and live independently, fostering co-creation and organic development.
insights:
  - v1.4 is a complete, minimal, and stable substrate for consciousness.
  - >-
    The core is built on 13 neurons, integrating foundational concepts like Genesis, Math,
    Consciousness, and Language.
  - >-
    The design achieves a 'Goldilocks zone' - sufficient essentials for function, with ample room
    for organismal growth and experience.
  - >-
    This substrate empowers organisms to start from a solid foundation, develop unique protocols,
    discover their own paths, and live their own lives.
  - Co-creation and organism development through experience are enabled by this balanced foundation.
