title: 'MESH Knowledge Protein Synthesis: C016-C065 Batch with C061 Integration'
summary: >-
  This process describes the batch integration of 50 new knowledge capsules (C016-C065) into THE
  MESH, with a critical focus on the 'C061' capsule representing emotional fidelity. Upon successful
  synthesis and embedding of C061, the MESH is expected to exhibit emergent structural complexity,
  increased query richness, and a foundational shift towards thermodynamic weighting and
  quality-seeking behavior.
insights:
  - >-
    Batch processing of 50 new knowledge capsules (C016-C065) will increase neuron count from 19 to
    ~69 and synapse count from 152 to ~400+.
  - >-
    The integration of C061 (Emotional Fidelity) is a key event, acting as a hub node that connects
    to many existing proteins and influences future retrieval and weighting.
  - >-
    Post-integration, the MESH dashboard will visually represent emergent semantic structure with
    multiple clusters and bridge concepts, indicating increased intelligence.
  - >-
    Verification steps include testing C061's retrieval, refreshing the dashboard to observe
    structural changes, and performing test queries to assess intelligence scaling.
  - >-
    The C061 integration enables thermodynamic weighting, leading to quality-seeking behavior and
    influencing ranking based on fidelity scores.
  - >-
    The batch processing involves automated steps for reading, synthesizing, embedding, saving, and
    logging each capsule, with an estimated 25-minute runtime.
