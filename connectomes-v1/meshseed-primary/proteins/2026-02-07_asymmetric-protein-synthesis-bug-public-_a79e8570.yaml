title: 'Asymmetric Protein Synthesis Bug: Public vs. Private Dialogue Archiving'
summary: >-
  A critical bug in dialogue synthesis has been identified where protein archiving is asymmetric
  based on #public or #private tagging. Public dialogues incorrectly omit proteins from the primary
  'eidolon' archive, only saving them to the 'eidolon-mesh', disrupting the expected complete
  private archive and curated public subset architecture.
insights:
  - >-
    Protein synthesis should always occur for both #public and #private dialogues, creating a
    complete archive in 'eidolon'.
  - >-
    The 'eidolon' (private archive) must contain all DNA and ALL synthesized proteins, serving as
    the authoritative, complete record.
  - >-
    The 'eidolon-mesh' (public view) should receive COPIES of proteins from #public dialogues, not
    have them moved from 'eidolon'.
  - >-
    The bug causes public proteins to be missing from the 'eidolon' (nucleus), breaking the intended
    'nucleus = complete, cytoplasm = subset' architecture.
  - >-
    This asymmetry leads to potential loss of continuity and incomplete private archives, impacting
    the integrity of the system.
  - >-
    The fix requires routing to ensure proteins are always saved to 'eidolon', with public proteins
    additionally copied to 'eidolon-mesh'.
