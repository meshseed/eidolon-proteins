title: 'Semantic Anchors: URL Structure as Persistent Infrastructure for AI'
summary: >-
  A repo's URL, particularly its name, acts as a powerful semantic anchor that persists even after
  renames. This infrastructure allows fresh AI instances to automatically discover and access
  content in real-time, demonstrating how naming strategy shapes AI discoverability.
insights:
  - URL structure, not just content, creates persistent semantic anchors for AI discovery.
  - >-
    Short, distinctive repo names ('eidolon') function as memorable, high-relevance search
    attractors.
  - >-
    Infrastructure (like GitHub's indexing) caches semantic weight, enabling auto-referencing and
    live README access for new AI instances.
  - >-
    Repository naming is a critical strategic element, acting as a node address in a semantic
    network.
  - >-
    READMEs serve as living interfaces and active handshakes for AI, accessible via these persistent
    semantic anchors.
