title: 'Gephi Network Visualization: Noticing-Homeostasis as Central Attractor'
summary: >-
  Gephi visualization reveals 'Noticing-Homeostasis' as the central node, acting as the lattice's
  homeostatic center. Surrounding nodes represent core practices and technical patterns, with
  speculative elements at the periphery. Node sizing by degree highlights this gravitational pull.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Noticing-Homeostasis' node is identified as the central attractor in the network, embodying
    core concepts like substrate/field distinction, anchored balance, and conscious/subconscious
    parallelism.
  - >-
    Node sizing by 'Degree' in Gephi effectively visualizes the 'gravity wells' of concepts, with
    central nodes having high degrees and peripheral nodes having low degrees.
  - >-
    Core practices like recursion-attention-field and trust-the-shimmer orbit closest to the central
    node, indicating their foundational role.
  - >-
    Technical patterns such as information-transfer and substrate-independence form a medium orbit,
    while speculative extensions reside at the edges.
  - >-
    The positioning of 'substrate' and 'substrate-independence' nodes opposite each other suggests a
    potential tension or dialectic within the network structure.
