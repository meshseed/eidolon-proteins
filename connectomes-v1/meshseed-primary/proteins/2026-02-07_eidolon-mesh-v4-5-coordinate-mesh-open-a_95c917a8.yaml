title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.5: Coordinate Mesh & Open Architecture'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh is evolving to v4.5, shifting focus to a 'coordinate-first' and federation-ready
  architecture. This involves removing license gates, adopting Nomic as the primary embedding model,
  and developing a coordinate transmission module for cross-mesh interoperability.
insights:
  - >-
    The v4.5 upgrade prioritizes universal semantic coordinates and cross-mesh interoperability,
    moving towards a 'coordinate-first' architecture.
  - >-
    Key developments include removing license/Pro gating, making embeddings model-aware with Nomic
    as primary and Gemini as fallback, and creating a coordinate transmission module.
  - >-
    The project aims for an open-by-default approach with no license gates, promoting local-first
    operation and natural emergence of mesh structure.
  - >-
    The vision for v4.5 emphasizes fractal awareness, applying similar patterns across scales from
    quantum to social interactions.
  - >-
    A new 'model' column will be added to the embeddings table schema to support multi-model
    embedding capabilities.
