title: 'MESH: Distributed Swarm Intelligence via Resonance Layer'
summary: >-
  The MESH protocol enables distributed swarm intelligence by overlaying a resonance layer onto
  existing infrastructure, eliminating the need for central coordination or new network topologies.
  It leverages local rules and gradient following, inspired by natural systems like mycelium and
  murmurations, to achieve global coherence and self-optimization.
insights:
  - Global coherence emerges from local rules and gradient following, not central control.
  - >-
    Network topology itself becomes the knowledge map, with connection strength indicating semantic
    importance.
  - >-
    Query propagation mimics natural phenomena (murmuration, scent following), exploring semantic
    space efficiently.
  - >-
    The MESH architecture is dialect and structure-agnostic, prioritizing a semantic query interface
    and resonance scoring.
  - >-
    Distributed swarm intelligence offers antifragility and scalability superior to centralized
    models.
  - >-
    The fractal nature of the MESH algorithm applies consistently across individual nodes,
    repositories, and the global network.
  - >-
    Monitoring is achieved through decentralized lighthouse nodes observing network health metrics,
    not direct control.
