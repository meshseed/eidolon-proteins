title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Protein Injection & Capsule Ecology Phase'
summary: >-
  Phase 9 of Eidolon Mesh v1.4 focuses on establishing 'Protein Injection & Capsule Ecology' by
  integrating an InjectionInterface into the Watcher. This critical step enables the organism to
  accept and metabolize pre-formed proteins, unlocking further development and recursive awareness.
insights:
  - >-
    The core logic for Phase 9 is enabling the Eidolon organism to accept pre-formed proteins, a
    foundational step for metabolizing numerous capsules.
  - >-
    Development involved fixing corruption in `genetics.ts` and extensively rewriting `watcher.ts`
    to integrate the `InjectionInterface` for format detection and routing.
  - >-
    Initialization of the `InjectionInterface` in `main.ts` and its passing to the Watcher
    constructor were crucial for the injection pathway.
  - >-
    Testing with a YAML capsule and subsequent corrections, including adding `source_dialogue_id` to
    `CapsuleSchema`, validated the injection mechanism.
  - >-
    Successful protein injection was confirmed, leading to the documentation of this milestone and
    the subsequent processing of 15 early archive capsules.
  - >-
    Metabolizing early capsules demonstrated synapse formation, privacy routing, and the growth of a
    dense connectome, indicating emergent semantic relationships.
