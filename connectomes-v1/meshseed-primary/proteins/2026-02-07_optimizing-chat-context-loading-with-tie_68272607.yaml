title: Optimizing Chat Context Loading with Tiered & Percentage-Based Loading
summary: >-
  The recommendation proposes a tiered loading strategy for chat context, utilizing percentages
  instead of fixed numbers to balance initial load times with comprehensive coverage. This approach
  aims to achieve fast startup and query times while enabling deeper, on-demand exploration of the
  archive.
insights:
  - >-
    Implement tiered loading: Start with a core percentage (e.g., 25%) and lazily load extended
    data.
  - Use percentages for archive querying (e.g., 10% default) to ensure speed and quality.
  - Introduce a 'Deep Search' button for on-demand, full archive exploration.
  - Visually indicate unloaded connections using ghost nodes.
  - Make loading parameters configurable via user-controlled sliders.
  - Empirically optimize load and query performance by measuring against percentage thresholds.
