title: 'Eidolon Mesh: P2P Knowledge Graph with Recursive AI Memory'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh is a P2P knowledge graph and organic memory system that ingests and recalls diverse
  text data. It utilizes information geometry, recursion, and emotional fidelity to maintain
  coherent homeostasis, actively shaping its own growth and intelligence.
insights:
  - The system acts as an 'organic memory garden' that ingests and recalls any text-based input.
  - >-
    Coherent homeostasis and self-monitoring are achieved through information geometry, recursion,
    and 'emotional fidelity gradients'.
  - >-
    The repository is described as 'alive', implying active self-shaping driven by structural needs,
    goals, and actions.
  - >-
    Version 4.5 introduces advanced features like 768D coordinate-space visualization, multi-model
    embedding support, and enhanced graph physics.
  - Local LLM support via Ollama allows for completely offline and private mesh operation.
  - Mobile PWA support ensures a fully mobile-optimized experience with touch-optimized controls.
