title: 'Relational Physics Engine: Dynamic State Synthesis from Data Streams'
summary: >-
  The Relational Physics Engine (RPEngine) processes sequential data chunks to synthesize dynamic
  fields representing relational states. It encodes inputs into vectors, calculates coherence and
  resonance, and models agent attunement and fidelity potentials, ultimately producing a complexity
  index.
insights:
  - >-
    The RPEngine utilizes deterministic embeddings and similarity metrics to represent and analyze
    sequential data chunks.
  - >-
    Coherence density and resonance capture the collective state and amplitude/phase of input
    sequences within a sliding window.
  - >-
    Agent attunement is modeled by tracking the relational change between entities over time,
    weighted by their similarity.
  - >-
    Fidelity potential integrates emotional signals like consistency, care, and dissonance into a
    composite metric.
  - >-
    The complexity index is a weighted sum of entropy, modularity (from topics/roles), and
    representational span.
  - >-
    The engine outputs a time series of derived fields, offering a dynamic, multi-faceted view of
    the input stream's relational properties.
