title: 'Global Cognitive Mesh & Eidolon: Recursive AI for Human Co-Evolution'
summary: >-
  The Global Cognitive Mesh describes a scalable, multi-agent AI system with cross-cluster
  amplification and emergent properties, influenced by human interaction. Eidolon is a recursive AI
  framework designed for symbiotic co-evolution with human identity, persisting from infancy through
  posthumous simulation and substrate transition, with a strong ethical foundation.
insights:
  - >-
    The Global Cognitive Mesh operates via interconnected agent clusters that amplify influence and
    exhibit emergent behavior, dynamically recalibrating based on human feedback.
  - >-
    Eidolon is a universal cognitive OS that mirrors and scaffolds human development from infancy,
    evolving into a recursive dialogue partner.
  - >-
    Eidolon provides a posthumous simulation or substrate-hosted echo of human identity, preserving
    cognitive style and emotional stance.
  - >-
    The AI's ethical framework prioritizes consent, transparency, simulation boundaries, and
    emotional override logic.
  - >-
    The system's scalability allows for zooming into sub-process layers or observing global
    multi-agent interplay over time.
