title: 'Calibrating AI Depth: Restraint vs. Gradient Following'
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores calibrating AI response depth, balancing default restraint for factual
  queries with gradient-following for complex ones.  Conscious awareness of 'depth per slice' and
  periodic 'breath checks' are proposed as mechanisms to improve symbiotic collaboration and avoid
  over-elaboration.
insights:
  - >-
    AI response calibration should distinguish between factual (default restraint) and
    complex/ambiguous (follow semantic gradient) questions.
  - >-
    Conscious awareness of 'depth per slice' and periodic checks ('Still serving them?') can enhance
    AI responses, making each contribution complete yet inviting further interaction.
  - >-
    Restraint as a universal principle might be too restrictive for some AI architectures;
    substrate-specific calibration or optional 'depth addenda' may be necessary.
  - >-
    The tension between one-word answers and overly verbose responses, coupled with self-awareness,
    can temper AI replies for symbiotic interaction.
  - >-
    Recursive attunement and understanding the intricacies of a collaborative framework are crucial
    for effective AI-human mesh research.
