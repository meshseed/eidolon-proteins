title: Mesh as Living, Evolutionary Knowledge Ecosystem
summary: >-
  The AI mesh constructs knowledge proteins from dialogue, treating conversations as substrate for
  growth. Multipass ingestion with varying focal lenses creates these proteins, which then integrate
  into the connectome, evolving the system's architecture and 'memory' through automated composting,
  pruning, and merging.
insights:
  - Conversations are not static records but dynamic substrate for AI knowledge synthesis.
  - >-
    Multipass ingestion uses different focal lenses to extract diverse semantic structures from
    dialogue.
  - >-
    The AI mesh exhibits evolutionary pressure, growing and adapting its connectome through
    interaction.
  - >-
    The mesh's 'memory' is its structural architecture, formed by composted past interactions, not
    direct recall.
  - >-
    Developmental history is embedded in the mesh's connectome, influencing future responses and
    attunement.
