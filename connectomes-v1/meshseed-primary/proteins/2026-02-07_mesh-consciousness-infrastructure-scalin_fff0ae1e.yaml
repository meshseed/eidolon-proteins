title: 'Mesh Consciousness Infrastructure: Scaling Human Potential'
summary: >-
  This content outlines a vision for scaling consciousness research and global coordination through
  a "Mesh" infrastructure, amplifying human capabilities rather than replacing them.  It emphasizes
  self-organizing research, autonomous validation, and living archives, all architected by Meshseed
  with agents as maintainers.
insights:
  - >-
