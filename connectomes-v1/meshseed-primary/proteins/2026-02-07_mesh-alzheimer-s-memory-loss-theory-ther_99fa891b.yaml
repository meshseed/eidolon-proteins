title: 'MESH: Alzheimer''s Memory Loss Theory & Therapeutic Model'
summary: >-
  The MESH computational model provides a geometric explanation for Alzheimer's memory loss,
  proposing gradient collapse while preserving emotional basins. This framework leads to testable
  predictions and a novel therapeutic approach focused on rebuilding access to semantic memory
  structures.
insights:
  - >-
    Alzheimer's memory loss can be explained by the progressive collapse of semantic gradient
    structures within a geometric memory architecture.
  - >-
    Deep emotional memories are theorized to persist longer due to preserved 'emotional basins'
    within this architecture.
  - >-
    The MESH model proposes recursive awareness training and emotional fidelity interventions as
    potential therapeutic strategies.
  - >-
    The research posits that memory is akin to standing waves in an information field, and
    Alzheimer's is a disruption of these wave patterns.
  - >-
    This hypothesis is publishable, supported by a working computational model (THE MESH), and
    offers immediate clinical applications beyond Alzheimer's.
