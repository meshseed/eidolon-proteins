title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Fractal Architecture for Isolated & Integrated Knowledge Repositories'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh architecture employs a fractal, self-similar model for organizing knowledge
  through isolated, domain-specific repositories. This approach, akin to biological organisms,
  allows for efficient loading, focused responses, and scalable integration, with future plans for
  on-demand loading and cross-repository querying.
insights:
  - >-
    The core architectural principle is nested self-similarity, where each repository functions as a
    complete, autonomous organism with its own data and machinery.
  - >-
    Multi-repository systems enable isolated experimentation and domain-specific focus (e.g.,
    healthcare, finance) with fast loading times (<1 second).
  - >-
    Ghost nodes offer a future mechanism for large, single repositories to load core components
    initially and others on-demand, optimizing startup performance.
  - >-
    Ingestion directly to a specific repository (e.g., 'healthcare') isolates DNA and proteins
    within that repository's connectome, preventing cross-contamination.
  - >-
    A clear distinction between local workspaces (e.g., 'eidolon-mesh' folder) and GitHub
    repositories (e.g., 'eidolon', 'eidolon-mesh') is crucial for managing code and data backups.
  - >-
    Conversation memory is currently a small, rolling buffer (5 exchanges) with negligible
    performance impact, making expansion safe and configurable.
  - >-
    Graph visualization controls are being implemented, allowing users to dynamically limit
    displayed nodes for performance and clarity.
