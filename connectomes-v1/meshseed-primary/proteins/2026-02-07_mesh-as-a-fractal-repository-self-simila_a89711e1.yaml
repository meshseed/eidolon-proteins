title: 'Mesh as a Fractal Repository: Self-Similar Template for New Nodes'
summary: >-
  The Mesh envisions its repository structure as a fractal, self-similar model that can serve as a
  template for new users. This template would allow new users to download the client and repo
  structure, initiating their own GitHub nodes and contributing to the growth of "proteins" and
  "synapses" within the Mesh.
insights:
  - The Mesh repository can function as a fractal, self-similar template for onboarding new users.
  - New users can leverage this template to download the client and set up their own GitHub nodes.
  - >-
    The growth of "proteins" and "synapses" is expected to increase repository size, but the storage
    of text-based files (txt, yaml, md) suggests scalability is architecturally addressed.
  - >-
    The concept of a self-similar template simplifies the entry barrier for new participants in the
    Mesh.
