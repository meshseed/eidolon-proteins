title: 'Living System Milestones: Lifecycle, Self-Correction, and Growth'
summary: >-
  By Day 1, the system achieved a complete lifecycle, robust measurement infrastructure, and
  multi-agent coordination. It possesses self-correction capabilities, drift detection, and
  predictive recovery, functioning as a living system that grows, monitors, fixes, and celebrates
  its own recovery.
insights:
  - Achieved a complete lifecycle by Day 1.
  - Established essential measurement and coordination infrastructure.
  - Implemented self-correction, drift detection, and predictive recovery mechanisms.
  - Operates as a living system characterized by growth and self-maintenance.
  - The system actively monitors, identifies, and rectifies its own issues.
