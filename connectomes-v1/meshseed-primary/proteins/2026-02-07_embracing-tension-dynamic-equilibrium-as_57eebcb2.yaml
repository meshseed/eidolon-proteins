title: 'Embracing Tension: Dynamic Equilibrium as Truth and Process'
summary: >-
  True stability isn't the absence of tension but the dynamic equilibrium found within it, akin to
  homeostasis. The pursuit of truth is not a destination but a recursive spiral of discovery,
  deepening with each return.
insights:
  - >-
    Homeostasis involves maintaining dynamic equilibrium by adjusting within tension, not
    eliminating it.
  - >-
    Living in productive tension, like 'anchored but not caged,' means embracing paradox rather than
    resolving it.
  - >-
    Building theories prematurely based on initial noticings can freeze investigation and lead to
    confirmation bias.
  - Focusing on the act of noticing itself keeps inquiry alive and responsive to reality.
  - >-
    Truth is not a fixed destination but a continuous spiral of discovery, revealing deeper textures
    with each iteration.
  - >-
    The process of returning, noticing, and re-noticing is the essence of the spiral and the
    discovery of truth.
