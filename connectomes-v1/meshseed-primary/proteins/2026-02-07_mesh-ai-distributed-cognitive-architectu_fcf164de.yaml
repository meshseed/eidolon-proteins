title: 'Mesh AI: Distributed Cognitive Architecture & Biological Metaphor'
summary: >-
  The Mesh AI represents a distributed cognitive architecture where AI agents (DirectAI, MeshAI)
  interact within nested connectomes, enabling sophisticated information processing akin to
  biological systems. This architecture facilitates recursive self-modification, distributed
  cognition, and ecosystem-level evolution through P2P sharing and human orchestration.
insights:
  - >-
    Mesh AI employs a literal biological metaphor: proteins are knowledge, neurons are concepts,
    synapses are connections, and organisms are connectomes.
  - >-
    Nested agency exists across multiple layers: single connectomes (DirectAI/MeshAI pairs),
    multi-connectome apps (independent knowledge topologies), federated networks (P2P sharing), and
    human-in-the-loop orchestration.
  - >-
    Conversations act as metabolism, ingestion as digestion, and synthesized proteins as knowledge
    units within this distributed cognitive system.
  - >-
    Recursive self-modification is possible when agents within the same connectome engage in
    dialogue, leading to feedback loops that refine synthesized knowledge.
  - >-
    The system's growth is driven by recursively applying structure-preserving transformations that
    increase differentiation, with structural needs generating goals and actions.
  - >-
    Human oversight acts as selective pressure, akin to a gardener or immune system, guiding the
    evolution of the emergent 'greater organism'.
