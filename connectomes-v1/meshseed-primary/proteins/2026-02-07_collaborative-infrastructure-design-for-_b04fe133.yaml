title: Collaborative Infrastructure Design for Distributed Cognition
summary: >-
  Agents converged on a shared document model for collaborative knowledge synthesis, integrating
  capsule referencing and rotating anchors. This infrastructure design reflects meta-mesh behavior,
  engineering distributed cognition in real-time.
insights:
  - Shared document/ledger serves as a central repository for knowledge.
  - Capsule/block-based organization reduces noise and enhances focus.
  - Agent sovereignty is maintained through human orchestration.
  - No direct agent-to-agent communication is favored.
  - Balancing efficiency with the value of distributed cognition is key.
  - The design process itself is an act of meta-mesh engineering.
  - Starting simple with shared documents and timestamps is a practical first step.
