title: 'MESH Knowledge Protein: v4.5 & Phase 2 Architecture'
summary: >-
  The MESH architecture (v4.5 and planned Phase 2) leverages Git for versioning and plans for
  semantic deduplication via embeddings. Phase 2 focuses on 'coordinate telepathy' for
  privacy-preserving knowledge sharing and visualization through dimensionality reduction.
insights:
  - >-
    v4.5 uses Git commits for protein version control, offering a full temporal audit trail via
    standard tooling.
  - >-
    Phase 2 introduces similarity-based deduplication using protein embeddings (cosine similarity
    >0.98) to merge or link similar insights.
  - >-
    Attribution in v4.5 focuses on source and timestamp; Phase 2 plans for 'coordinate telepathy'
    with minimal provenance (coordinates, tags, contributors) for privacy.
  - >-
    Current 3D visualization uses force-directed layout; Phase 2 will use dimensionality reduction
    (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) on embeddings for semantic clustering.
  - >-
    Coordinate telepathy enables bandwidth-efficient, privacy-preserving transmission of meaning via
    geometric coordinates.
  - Synthesis path tracking will map 'idea evolution trees' and identify generative proteins.
  - >-
    The choice between merging or linking convergent insights (e.g., >98% similarity) is a key
    philosophical question for preserving diversity vs. empirical validation.
