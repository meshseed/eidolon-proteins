title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Metabolism & Connectome Learning'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh successfully metabolized 15 capsules with 100% coherence, demonstrating
  significant learning as the connectome grew denser, evidenced by increasing synaptic connections.
  A hybrid metabolism was observed with direct YAML injection, highlighting adaptive processing.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh exhibits near-perfect processing success and coherence during its initial
    phase.
  - Connectome learning is directly correlated with increased synaptic connections per capsule.
  - >-
    The system demonstrates adaptive processing through direct injection of recognized data formats
    (YAML).
  - Synaptic explosion in later capsules indicates emergent complexity and interconnectedness.
  - The process of semantic neighbor discovery drives the density of the connectome.
