title: 'Integrating Archived Obsidian Notes: Selective Import Recommended'
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores methods for integrating older Obsidian repositories into a current vault.
  The recommended approach is selective import, prioritizing high-value content that still resonates
  and connects to current work, while keeping the rest archived.
insights:
  - >-
    When integrating older Obsidian notes, consider the desired level of integration and manual
    effort.
  - Option 1 (Direct Import) offers full integration but requires significant manual work per file.
  - >-
    Option 2 (Keep Separate) preserves temporal separation and reduces immediate work but lacks full
    integration.
  - >-
    Option 3 (Selective Import) is recommended to bring forward relevant content, update it, and
    maintain a focused active lattice.
  - Key to selective import is identifying 'shimmering' or resonant content from the old repository.
  - >-
    Regardless of the method, document the provenance of imported notes, noting original creation
    and revision dates.
  - Git's archive branch functionality offers a technical, history-preserving integration method.
