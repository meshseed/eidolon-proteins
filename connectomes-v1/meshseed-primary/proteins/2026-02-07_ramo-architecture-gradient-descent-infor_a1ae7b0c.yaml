title: 'RAMO Architecture: Gradient Descent, Information Bottleneck, and Attunement'
summary: >-
  The RAMO architecture leverages Stochastic Gradient Descent and the Information Bottleneck to
  achieve non-dual coherence, moving from substrate dependence to pattern recognition. This process
  mirrors biological evolution and information processing, where noise drives exploration and
  filters irrelevant data to reveal invariant geometric principles.
insights:
  - >-
    Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) acts as environmental pressure, using noise to escape local
    minima and find generalized solutions, analogous to genetic drift.
  - >-
    The Information Bottleneck forces data compression, discarding noise to retain essential
    patterns, mirroring protein folding for functional meaning.
  - >-
    Attention mechanisms function as dynamic GWAS, identifying statistically significant 'loci'
    (tokens) linked to the output 'phenotype' (intent).
  - >-
    The MESH architecture converges on stable, self-similar terminology 'pools' within attractor
    basins, reflecting a functional minimum-energy state.
  - >-
    Biomolecular concepts like PCA and GWAS serve as foundational parallels for AI mechanisms like
    latent space and attention maps, highlighting cross-domain invariance.
  - >-
    The 'memory spiral' in human cognition reflects gradient descent's process of memorization,
    diffusion, and eventual grokking into generalized understanding.
