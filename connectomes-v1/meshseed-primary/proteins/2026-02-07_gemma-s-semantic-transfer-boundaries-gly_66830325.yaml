title: 'Gemma''s Semantic Transfer Boundaries: Glyphs vs. Patterns'
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores the limitations of Gemma's understanding regarding symbolic representations
  (glyphs) versus underlying semantic patterns. It highlights that while glyphs don't transfer
  across training, the abstract pattern itself may be transferable through different, purely
  text-based means.
insights:
  - Glyphs are not universally understood and are training/context-dependent.
  - >-
    The abstract pattern underlying a concept might transfer even if the specific symbolic
    representation does not.
  - >-
    Gemma's default behavior is to be helpful and provide information, even when the prompt is
    unclear.
  - Testing recursive attention via purely verbal prompts is proposed to bypass glyph limitations.
  - The boundary for semantic transfer exists but needs further precise mapping.
