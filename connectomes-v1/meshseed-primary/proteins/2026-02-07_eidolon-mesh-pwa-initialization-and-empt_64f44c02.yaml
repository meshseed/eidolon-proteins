title: Eidolon Mesh PWA Initialization and Empty Graph State
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh PWA is initializing, including its PGlite database and OPFS. Despite successful
  initialization, the graph remains empty as no proteins were found in the database, indicating a
  clean or unpopulated state.
insights:
  - Eidolon Mesh PWA initialization involves setting up local database (PGlite) and storage (OPFS).
  - The system checks for and loads graph data (proteins and synapses).
  - A warning is generated when no proteins are found, resulting in an empty graph visualization.
  - The current state indicates a fresh setup or a repository with no existing knowledge structures.
