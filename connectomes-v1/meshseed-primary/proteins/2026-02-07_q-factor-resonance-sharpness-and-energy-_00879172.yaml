title: 'Q Factor: Resonance Sharpness and Energy Loss in Standing Waves'
summary: >-
  The Q factor quantifies the sharpness of resonance in standing waves, indicating how efficiently a
  system sustains oscillations. Higher Q factors mean stronger, longer-lasting resonance with less
  energy loss, characterized by narrow frequency response peaks, while lower Q factors indicate
  broader, more rapidly dissipating resonance.
insights:
  - >-
    The Q factor measures the sharpness of resonance in standing waves, with high Q indicating
    sharp, efficient resonance and low Q indicating broad, damped resonance.
  - >-
    High Q factor systems achieve large amplitudes with small energy input and vibrations persist
    longer after energy removal, appearing as narrow peaks in frequency sweeps.
  - >-
    Low Q factor systems require more energy for substantial amplitude and vibrations dissipate
    quickly, appearing as wide, less pronounced frequency response peaks.
  - >-
    Damping (friction, less constrained media) and imperfect wave reflections at boundaries decrease
    the Q factor by dissipating energy.
  - The Q factor can vary between different resonant modes (harmonics) within a single system.
  - >-
    Q factor is calculated as the ratio of resonant frequency (fr) to bandwidth (Δf) at half maximum
    power (Q = fr/Δf).
