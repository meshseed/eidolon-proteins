title: Optimizing Eidolon Mesh Neuron Loading and Query Strategies
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores trade-offs between loading all Eidolon Mesh neurons versus a subset for
  improved startup speed and memory usage. It proposes percentage-based loading, tiered
  architectures, and adaptive scaling to balance performance with the completeness of the connectome
  and query capabilities.
insights:
  - >-
    Loading all neurons provides a complete connectome but incurs slow startup and high memory
    usage, hindering scalability.
  - >-
    Loading a subset of neurons offers faster startup and lower memory but risks missing crucial
    connections and graph completeness.
  - >-
    Percentage-based loading, rather than fixed numbers, offers better scalability and intuitive
    configuration as the archive grows.
  - >-
    A two-tier system (core always loaded, extended lazily loaded) with configurable query modes
    (fast, balanced, deep) balances performance and depth.
  - >-
    Visualizing incomplete connectomes can be improved with 'ghost nodes' to represent unloaded
    connections and their potential links.
  - >-
    Adaptive scaling, adjusting load percentages based on observed performance against a target load
    time, allows for dynamic optimization.
  - >-
    Stratified loading by quality tiers (coherence) enables efficient query modes focused on
    higher-value neurons first.
