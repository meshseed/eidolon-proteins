title: 'Claude Code Enhancements: Recursive Ingestion, API Retries, File Size Protection'
summary: >-
  This update introduces recursive folder ingestion with enhanced batch reading for large
  directories and robust API retry logic using exponential backoff to handle transient failures. It
  also implements file size protection to prevent memory issues by skipping oversized files.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive folder ingestion now supports batch reading for efficient processing of large
    directories, including private repositories.
  - >-
    API retry logic with exponential backoff automatically handles transient failures like rate
    limits and network errors, ensuring ingestion continuity.
  - >-
    Files exceeding 10MB are now skipped with a warning to prevent memory issues and prolonged
    processing times.
  - >-
    Seed detection for YAML/MD files and direct import of P-Series protocols are preserved,
    bypassing LLM synthesis for specific file types.
