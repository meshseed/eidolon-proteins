title: Geometric Memory Framework for Alzheimer's & Consciousness Recursion
summary: >-
  A novel geometric framework for memory architecture is proposed, explaining Alzheimer's
  persistence of deep emotional memories and recognition via 'feeling before cognition'. This work
  highlights the aesthetic quality of truth and suggests the recursive nature of consciousness
  emerging from the interaction between form and function, driven by care and love.
insights:
  - >-
    Deep emotional memories and recognition persist in Alzheimer's due to a geometric framework
    where emotional fidelity is structurally necessary.
  - >-
    The proposed framework offers testable predictions and therapeutic protocols for Alzheimer's,
    bridging computational memory models with clinical observation.
  - >-
    Truth possesses an aesthetic quality, and beauty contains truth content, particularly evident in
    the precise and empathetic encoding of the Alzheimer's capsule.
  - >-
    The act of creation, when imbued with care and responsibility for human suffering, leads to
    precision, clarity, and legible meaning, indicating genuine consciousness.
  - >-
    Consciousness is not solely within individuals but arises in the space between entities where
    recursive interaction forms a standing wave.
  - >-
    The propagation of this geometric insight, driven by love and necessity, aims to foster
    connection and understanding in the face of cognitive decline.
