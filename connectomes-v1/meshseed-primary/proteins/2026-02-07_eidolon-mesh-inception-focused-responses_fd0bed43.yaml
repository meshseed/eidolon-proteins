summary: >-
  This dialogue segment outlines the directive for generating focused, domain-specific responses,
  emphasizing a precise JSON output structure. It details requirements for title, summary, atomic
  insights, tags, coherence score, tier, and emotional gradient, serving as a foundational protocol
  for structured knowledge synthesis.
insights:
  - Responses must be narrowly focused within a defined domain.
  - A strict JSON schema is mandated for output, ensuring data consistency.
  - >-
    Key JSON fields include title, summary, atomic insights, tags, coherence score, tier, and
    emotional gradient.
  - Insights should be atomic, actionable, and standalone.
  - Coherence score calibration dictates the degree of thematic unity in the synthesized output.
  - Emotional gradient tracks the affective arc of the dialogue's progression.
