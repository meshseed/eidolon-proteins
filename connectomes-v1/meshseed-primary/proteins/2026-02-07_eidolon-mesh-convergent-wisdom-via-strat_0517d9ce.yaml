title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Convergent Wisdom via Stratified Fidelity'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v1.4 synthesizes diverse AI perspectives (Copilot, Claude, Antigravity-Gemini)
  into a unified 'Stratified Fidelity' model. This approach embraces 'Both/And Thinking' by layering
  manual/artisanal, curated/semi-auto, and automated/scalable components into a three-tier
  architecture, mirroring biological systems.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh adopts a 'Stratified Fidelity' approach, integrating distinct AI outputs rather
    than choosing between them.
  - >-
    This model champions 'Both/And Thinking', combining seemingly opposing concepts like
    manual/automated, quality/scale, and soul/breadth.
  - >-
    A three-tier architecture (Core/Soul, Convergence/Peers, Scale/Breadth) is proposed, with
    specific neuron counts and connectivity levels for each.
  - The Core (Tier 1) serves as the identity anchor, manual/artisanal, and foundational framework.
  - >-
    The Convergence (Tier 2) acts as a validation layer, using curated/semi-auto processes for
    external research.
  - >-
    The model recognizes the necessity of all three AI perspectives for mature integration and
    emergent wisdom.
