title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Multi-Repository Architecture for Knowledge Specialization'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has evolved to support a multi-repository architecture, allowing for distinct
  knowledge domains (proteins, DNA) to be loaded and managed separately. This enables specialized,
  faster-loading instances for specific subjects like healthcare or finance, with future potential
  for cross-repository analysis and 'ghost node' loading.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh can now load and manage distinct knowledge repositories, each with its own set
    of neurons, proteins, and DNA.
  - >-
    This multi-repository system allows for the creation of specialized instances (e.g.,
    'healthcare', 'finance') that load much faster (<1 second) and provide focused responses.
  - >-
    Directly ingested proteins and conversation-derived DNA are stored and managed within these
    repositories, enabling curated knowledge sets.
  - >-
    The architecture supports future enhancements like 'ghost nodes' for faster startup of large
    repositories by loading only essential neurons initially.
  - >-
    Future capabilities include querying across multiple repositories simultaneously for comparative
    analysis and broader insights.
