title: 'Attractor-Based Composting: A Fractal Ecology for Knowledge Synthesis'
summary: >-
  This dialogue synthesizes ecological and technical approaches to knowledge management, introducing
  attractor-based composting as a core mechanism for self-organizing knowledge systems. The system
  operates recursively across multiple scales, from proteins to federated meshes, employing adaptive
  forgetting to maintain coherence and promote natural selection.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge is best managed by 'composting' clusters of related information (attractors) rather
    than individual units (proteins).
  - >-
    A fractal, multi-scale approach (protein, attractor, repository, federation) enables recursive
    self-organization and maintenance.
  - >-
    Adaptive forgetting (decay coefficient) is crucial for pruning unused knowledge and maintaining
    system vitality.
  - >-
    Attractor-based federation allows for the import and natural selection of diverse knowledge
    ecosystems.
  - >-
    The 'attractor' concept, representing high-coherence hubs, is central to both identifying and
    merging knowledge clusters.
  - >-
    A unified design integrates technical implementation with ecological principles for a robust,
    self-cleaning knowledge ecology.
