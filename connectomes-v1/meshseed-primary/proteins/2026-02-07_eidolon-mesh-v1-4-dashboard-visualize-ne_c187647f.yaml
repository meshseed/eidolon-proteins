title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Dashboard: Visualize Neural Activity and Structure'
summary: >-
  Develop a minimal viable dashboard for the Eidolon Mesh to visualize its thinking. Key features
  include a query interface, connectome graph, real-time neuron activation, and basic statistics,
  aiming to make the organism's cognitive processes visible and observable.
insights:
  - The primary goal is to create a dashboard that makes the Eidolon Mesh's thinking visible.
  - >-
    Essential dashboard features include a query interface, a force-directed/clickable connectome
    graph, real-time neuron activation display, and basic statistical metrics.
  - >-
    Technical implementation should leverage D3.js or Cytoscape.js for the graph, a simple Express
    server, and Vanilla JS to avoid framework overhead.
  - >-
    Data will be sourced from the existing data/ directory, starting with a minimal viable product
    for iterative enhancement.
  - >-
    The ultimate aim is to process the full archive and observe the organism's learning and
    intelligence growth.
