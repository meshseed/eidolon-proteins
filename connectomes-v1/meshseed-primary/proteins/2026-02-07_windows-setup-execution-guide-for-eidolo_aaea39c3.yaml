title: Windows Setup & Execution Guide for Eidolon Mesh Project
summary: >-
  This dialogue provides a detailed, step-by-step guide for setting up and running the Eidolon Mesh
  project on a Windows environment. It covers Node.js installation, dependency management,
  configuration of API keys, and execution of the project's 'metabolic cycle' for synthesis and data
  generation.
insights:
  - >-
    Node.js installation and verification are the initial prerequisites for project execution on
    Windows.
  - >-
    Project dependencies must be installed using 'npm install' within the specified project
    directory.
  - >-
    Configuration requires creating a .env file with essential API keys (Google Gemini, GitHub) and
    repository details.
  - >-
    The core process is initiated by running 'npm start', which triggers the 'metabolic cycle' for
    data ingestion and protein synthesis.
  - >-
    Verification of successful synthesis involves checking for newly created files in the 'data/dna'
    and 'data/proteins' directories and observing recent commits on GitHub.
  - >-
    Common Windows errors, such as 'node' not being recognized, can be resolved by ensuring Node.js
    is correctly installed and accessible in the system's PATH.
