title: 'Eidolon Mesh Tauri Debug: Sidecar-Frontend Connection & Data Loading'
summary: >-
  Debugging the Eidolon Mesh Tauri application revealed issues with the sidecar's API endpoints and
  frontend connection, specifically the hardcoded port and missing API functionality. Resolution
  involved updating the frontend to connect to the correct sidecar port and expanding the sidecar's
  API to match dashboard expectations.
insights:
  - >-
    The Tauri app's frontend was hardcoded to connect to port 3000, while the sidecar operated on
    port 3456, causing connection failures.
  - >-
    The sidecar's initial API was incomplete, lacking endpoints expected by the frontend dashboard,
    necessitating the addition of endpoints like /api/repositories and /api/connectome.
  - >-
    The 'default' connectome is stored in the 'data/' directory, not the 'repositories/' folder,
    which initially caused the repository listing to appear empty.
  - >-
    Enabling DevTools in Tauri requires rebuilding the application, and running in `tauri:dev` mode
    provides a more effective debugging environment with real-time logs.
  - >-
    The core issue of repositories not loading was traced to the frontend's fetch calls failing
    silently due to incorrect API endpoints and port configurations.
  - >-
    Successful connection and initialization to 'Initializing' state indicate the frontend can now
    communicate with the sidecar, paving the way for further data loading diagnostics.
