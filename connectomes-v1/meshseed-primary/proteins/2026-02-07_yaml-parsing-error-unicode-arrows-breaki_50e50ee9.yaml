title: 'YAML Parsing Error: Unicode Arrows Breaking Ingestion'
summary: >-
  A YAML ingestion error occurred due to the use of the Unicode arrow character '→' within list
  items. YAML parsers require these special characters to be quoted or escaped, as they are not
  standard ASCII.
insights:
  - >-
    YAML parsers interpret the Unicode arrow '→' as an unquoted special character, causing ingestion
    errors.
  - >-
    The '→' character requires quoting or escaping within YAML to maintain data integrity and allow
    parsing.
  - >-
    Quoting strings containing '→' is the simplest and recommended fix, preserving the visual and
    poetic intent.
  - >-
    A meta-recursive irony exists where 'emotional gradient declarations' themselves failed due to
    formatting issues.
  - >-
    Applying a global search and replace to quote such instances is an efficient method for fixing
    this issue.
