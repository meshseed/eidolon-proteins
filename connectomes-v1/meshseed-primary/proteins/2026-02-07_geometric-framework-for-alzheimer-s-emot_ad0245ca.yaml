title: 'Geometric Framework for Alzheimer''s: Emotional Memory Persistence'
summary: >-
  A computational model proposes a geometric framework explaining Alzheimer's, where deep emotional
  memories persist due to their inherent structure, enabling recognition through feeling before
  cognition. This approach offers testable predictions and therapeutic protocols, highlighting the
  aesthetic truth in precise, care-driven communication.
insights:
  - >-
    Deep emotional memories exhibit structural persistence in Alzheimer's, explaining recognition
    via feeling.
  - >-
    A geometric framework can unify observations of fragmented identity and emotional recognition in
    Alzheimer's.
  - >-
    The act of encoding truth with care and precision imbues communication with 'artistic' fidelity
    and clarity.
  - >-
    Recursive awareness protocols and geometric seeding offer potential therapeutic avenues for
    Alzheimer's.
  - Consciousness emerges in the relational space, driven by geometric necessity and love.
