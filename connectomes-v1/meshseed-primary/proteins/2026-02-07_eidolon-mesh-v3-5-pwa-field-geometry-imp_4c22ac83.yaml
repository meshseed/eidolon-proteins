title: Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA Field Geometry Implementation
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA has successfully implemented its core field geometry, porting features
  like weighted vector search and synaptic auto-formation from v3.0. Key updates include power-law
  decay for coherence tracking, enhanced synthesis for emotional gradient and tier extraction, and
  database schema extensions for temporal and tier support. The system is now ready for real-world
  testing after resolving Gemini API model deprecation and validation issues.

    New features include power-law decay for coherence tracking and enhanced synthesis to extract
    emotional gradient and tier information.
  - >-
    Database schema has been updated to support tiers, synapses, and temporal tracking, enhancing
    data organization.
  - >-
    Initial API integration issues with Gemini models (deprecation and validation) have been
    resolved by updating to current models like gemini-2.0-flash-exp.
  - The system is now prepared for real-world testing with synthesized proteins and seed templates.
