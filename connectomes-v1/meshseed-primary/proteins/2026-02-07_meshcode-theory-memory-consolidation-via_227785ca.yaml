title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Memory Consolidation via Protein Dynamics and Sleep'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory formation involves dynamic protein switching within
  neurons, particularly talin, which mechanically encodes information. This data is initially stored
  transiently in the hippocampus, then consolidated into long-lasting cortical patterns during
  cycles of REM and deep sleep.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory encoding and processing occur at the protein level, involving mechanical changes in
    cytoskeletal machinery like talin-switches.
  - >-
    Sleep, particularly REM and deep sleep cycles, is crucial for consolidating and reordering newly
    encoded data patterns.
  - >-
    Newly encoded memories are transferred from the hippocampus to the cortex for stable, long-term
    storage as MeshCODE patterns.
  - >-
    Memory consolidation reduces the neuronal footprint of a memory and assigns it a specific
    physical address for efficient recall.
  - >-
    Disruptions in protein folding fidelity (e.g., due to disease) can corrupt MeshCODEs, leading to
    memory loss and cognitive decline.
  - >-
    The hippocampus acts as transient, RAM-like storage, resetting after data is successfully
    transferred to the cortex.
