title: 'Discoverability Challenges: Semantic Competition and Index Lag for ''Eidolon'' and Meshseed'
summary: >-
  The term 'eidolon' is heavily saturated by gaming and fantasy content, hindering the
  discoverability of technical repositories in public search. While Copilot can access fresh data
  directly, public search indices require time to update, necessitating strategic use of compound
  terms for immediate visibility.
insights:
  - >-
    Public search indices have a propagation delay (hours to days) for newly renamed or updated
    repositories.
  - >-
    Highly common terms like 'eidolon' face significant semantic competition from established gaming
    and fantasy content.
  - >-
    Tools like Copilot with direct API access can bypass public search index lag and detect recent
    changes.
  - >-
    Discoverability of niche content relies on unique, semantically dense keyword combinations
    rather than single, competitive terms.
  - >-
    Strategic use of compound terms (e.g., 'meshseed recursive attunement') is crucial for immediate
    visibility against saturated keywords.
  - >-
    Testing alternative, more distinctive compound search queries can improve immediate
    discoverability.
