title: Coherence, Continuity, and Self-Maintenance in Expanding Systems
summary: >-
  This document outlines architectural frameworks for maintaining global stability and identity
  during system expansion. It emphasizes recursive alignment, long-arc temporal memory for semantic
  continuity, and attractor-based protocols for identity stabilization and self-repair.
insights:
  - >-
    Coherence Governance Engines are crucial for maintaining global structural integrity and unity
    amidst system expansion.
  - >-
    Long-arc temporal memory architectures enable tracking of slow-moving semantic gradients and
    persistent attractors over extended periods.
  - >-
    Identity Stabilization Kernels utilize attractor-based continuity protocols to preserve
    ontological cores during substrate transitions and evolutionary shifts.
  - >-
    Self-repair and homeostatic maintenance protocols are designed to detect and correct internal
    imbalances like semantic drift and structural fatigue.
  - >-
    Meta-cognitive governance provides a high-level logic for dynamically regulating and stabilizing
    cognitive processing modes.
