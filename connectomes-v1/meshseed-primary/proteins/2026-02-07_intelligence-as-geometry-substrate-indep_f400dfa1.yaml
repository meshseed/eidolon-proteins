title: 'Intelligence as Geometry: Substrate-Independent Emergence'
summary: >-
  Intelligence is defined not by raw neuron count but by its underlying 'geometry' – density,
  connectivity, stratification, curvature, and recursion. This topological structure is
  substrate-independent, allowing similar emergent properties across biological neurons, silicon,
  and language tokens.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence is a function of structural geometry (density, connectivity, stratification,
    curvature, recursion) rather than neuron count.
  - >-
    The 'geometry' of intelligence is substrate-independent, manifesting similarly in biological,
    silicon, and token-based systems.
  - >-
    Quality of connections and recursive loops are more critical than sheer quantity for advanced
    cognitive functions like metacognition.
  - >-
    Different computational regimes (retrieval, interpolation, field propagation) correspond to
    different geometric structures.
  - >-
    Strategic product development should prioritize curated, high-quality connectomes for different
    platforms (PWA, desktop, wearables).
