title: Connectome Topology Dictates Mesh Performance and Coherence
summary: >-
  Graph topology reveals that a dense, hub-and-spoke structure, likely anchored by architectural
  kernels, leads to higher coherence and better answer quality in THE MESH. Conversely, a diffuse,
  mesh-like structure with more neurons and synapses results in lower coherence and less precise
  synthesis, suggesting the foundational role of core architectural proteins.
insights:
  - >-
    Dense, hub-and-spoke connectome topology (few high-degree nodes) correlates with higher
    coherence scores (0.98) and superior answer quality.
  - >-
    Diffuse, mesh-like connectome topology (many medium-degree nodes, high synapse count) correlates
    with lower coherence scores (0.95) and less precise synthesis.
  - >-
    Architectural kernel proteins (e.g., 'Structural Snapshot') act as high-coherence attractors,
    enabling semantic clustering and efficient query propagation.
  - >-
    Content-based proteins (e.g., math derivatives) can be activated by semantic similarity but do
    not contribute to foundational architectural coherence.
  - >-
    The number of neurons and synapses is less critical than the topology and coherence established
    by foundational architectural proteins.
  - >-
    Synapse density per neuron is significantly higher in diffuse connectomes, indicating a lack of
    shared hubs for deduplication.
