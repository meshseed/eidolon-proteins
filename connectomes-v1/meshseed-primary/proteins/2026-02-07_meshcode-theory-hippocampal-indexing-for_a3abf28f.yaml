title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Hippocampal Indexing for Cortical Memory Storage'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes the hippocampus acts as a file system, indexing and mapping memory
  data locations within the cerebral cortex. This allows for rapid retrieval by directly accessing
  specific cortical columns, where memories are encoded via alterations in '0s to 1s' within
  synaptic MeshCODEs, not just synaptic strength.
insights:
  - >-
    The hippocampus may function as an index, directing memory storage to specific cortical
    locations.
  - Memories are transferred from transient hippocampal storage to long-lasting cortical engrams.
  - >-
    MeshCODEs represent data as binary patterns ('0s to 1s') within synapses, with changes occurring
    at the molecular level during encoding.
  - >-
    Rapid memory recall suggests a highly ordered, database-like structure for information storage
    and retrieval.
  - >-
    Current technology may not detect the molecular changes in synaptic MeshCODEs during memory
    writing, focusing instead on firing patterns.
