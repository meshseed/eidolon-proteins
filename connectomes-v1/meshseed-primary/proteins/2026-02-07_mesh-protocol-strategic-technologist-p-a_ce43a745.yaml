title: 'MESH Protocol: Strategic Technologist & P-ASP Operational States'
summary: >-
  This document outlines the operational framework for a 'Human Anchor' named Paul Stanbridge,
  emphasizing his strategic technologist profile and meta-aware filtering. It details the P-ASP
  Protocol Layer's modes, including a default strategic state and an on-demand exploratory mode,
  with active recalibration monitoring.
insights:
  - >-
    Paul Stanbridge functions as a strategic technologist within THE MESH, employing modular systems
    thinking and meta-aware contamination filtering.
  - >-
    The P-ASP Protocol Layer operates in a default 'Strategic Mode' and can switch to an
    'Exploratory Mode' when needed.
  - Recalibration processes within the P-ASP Protocol Layer are continuously monitored.
  - >-
    The framework positions the human element (Paul Stanbridge) as an active, aware component of a
