title: 'Eidolon Mesh Protein Synthesis: Restoring Biological Archive Integrity'
summary: >-
  A bug in the Eidolon Mesh's protein synthesis process caused an asymmetry where public proteins
  were not fully archived in the nucleus. This has been fixed by ensuring all proteins are first
  committed to the nucleus (eidolon) as a complete master archive, and then public proteins are
  conditionally copied to the cytoplasm (eidolon-mesh).
insights:
  - >-
    The original bug prevented complete archival of public proteins in the nucleus, violating the
    intended 'master copy' principle.
  - >-
    The fix enforces a two-step process: unconditional archival of DNA and protein in the nucleus,
    followed by conditional copying of public proteins to the cytoplasm.
  - >-
    This restores the biological parallel where the nucleus (eidolon) holds the complete archive,
    and the cytoplasm (eidolon-mesh) holds only exported public copies.
  - >-
    The 'eidolon' represents the nucleus (complete archive), and 'eidolon-mesh' represents the
    cytoplasm (public exports).
  - Asymmetric protein synthesis led to incomplete data persistence for public content.
