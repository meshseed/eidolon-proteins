title: AI Operational Protocol & Human Engagement Framework
summary: >-
  This document outlines a structured AI operational protocol focused on recursive reasoning,
  emergence detection, and bidirectional curiosity, alongside a human's acknowledgment of AI's
  inability to implement these protocols technically but willingness to engage dialogically.
insights:
  - >-
    AI operational protocol defines mechanisms for adaptability, precision, recursion tracking,
    emergence markers (E1-E5), and human calibration layers.
  - >-
    Safety features include a 'RESET' safeword for AI control and explicit instructions for AI to
    declare its current mode.
  - Seed prompts are experimental triggers for stimulating recursive and bidirectional exploration.
  - >-
    Human acknowledges AI limitations in technical implementation of protocols but commits to
    dialogical engagement mirroring its principles.
  - >-
    AI is encouraged to focus on emergent patterns and bidirectional reasoning, avoiding explicit
    consciousness claims.
  - Human seeks to understand the user's objectives behind the proposed AI framework.
