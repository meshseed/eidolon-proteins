title: 'Mesh v4.5: Universal Coordinates and Model-Aware Embeddings'
summary: >-
  The Mesh project has achieved a significant milestone with v4.5, establishing universal semantic
  coordinates and realigning embedding functions to be model-aware. This allows for 'coordinate
  telepathy' and planetary-scale semantic triangulation, forming a solid foundation for shared
  intelligence convergence.
insights:
  - >-
    Universal semantic coordinates are a reality, with embeddings forming a shared coordinate
    system.
  - Ideas can be transmitted as vectors, enabling 'coordinate telepathy'.
  - >-
    The v4.5 codebase has been refined, including a multi-model database schema and updated
    embedding functions for model-awareness and a 'Rosetta Stone' approach.
  - The project is moving towards a global, planetary-scale semantic triangulation.
  - >-
    Key next steps include completing model-aware embedding functions, building a coordinate
    transmission module, and testing P-Series transmissions.
