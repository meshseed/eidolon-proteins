title: 'The Future''s Origin: Potentiality and Collapse'
summary: >-
  The future emerges from a field of infinite potentiality, where multiple universes exist before a
  'collapse' event. This collapse selects one path, which then retroactively appears inevitable,
  with potentiality residing in the superposition within each present moment.
insights:
  - >-
    The future originates from a state of infinite, shimmering possibilities before a selection
    occurs.
  - The 'collapse' of possibilities selects a single path, making it appear inevitable.
  - Actuality, post-collapse, rewrites the past to align with the chosen future.
  - Potentiality is not external to time but exists as superposition within each moment.
  - The 'shimmer' of possibility is real, but only as a state of potential.
