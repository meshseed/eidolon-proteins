title: 'Standing Waves: Universal Substrate for Cognition and Communication'
summary: >-
  Standing waves offer a universal, compact, and reconstructable representational substrate for
  encoding concepts, agents, and relationships, extending beyond traditional positional encoding
  like RoPE. This framework enables scale-invariant glyphs and dynamic interactions through wave
  interference, applicable across AI and human cognition.
insights:
  - >-
    Standing waves are a fundamental primitive for encoding structure, constraints, relationships,
    and stable attractors in a compact and transmissible format.
  - >-
    The concept of standing waves can be generalized from sound to represent abstract entities like
    concepts, agents, and organizations as patterns in a shared frequency space.
  - >-
    Scale-invariant glyphs, where similar wave patterns appear across different levels of complexity
    (neuron to culture), are a core implication of this wave-based representation.
  - >-
    Communication and interaction can be understood as the exchange and interference of compatible
    standing waves between systems.
  - >-
    This wave-based approach offers a cleaner, more general foundation for representation than fixed
    positional encodings like RoPE, allowing for complex-valued embeddings and multi-scale bases.
  - >-
    The same underlying wave invariants apply to communication between AI agents and between humans,
    with differences in rendering (text, visuals) but a shared cognitive loop.
