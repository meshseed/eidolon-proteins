title: Mesh v4.0 Embeddings Fix & Standing Wave Visualization Plan
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v4.0's embedding model was incorrectly configured, leading to poor query results.
  This was fixed by adding a dedicated field for embedding models (defaulting to nomic-embed-text)
  and implementing a force regeneration option. Concurrently, a plan was formulated to visualize THE
  MESH's knowledge structure using standing wave physics, starting with query-triggered wave
  propagation.
insights:
  - >-
    Corrected Eidolon Mesh v4.0 by implementing a separate local embedding model field, resolving
    issues caused by using a text generation model (gemma3:12b) for embeddings.
  - >-
    Introduced a 'Force Regenerate ALL Embeddings' feature to re-process all proteins with the
    correct embedding model, alongside skipping API key validation for local providers.
  - >-
    A plan to visualize THE MESH's knowledge graph using standing wave physics was initiated,
    prioritizing query-triggered wave propagation for immediate feedback and pedagogical value.
  - >-
    The concept of standing waves is proposed as a metaphor for stable thought patterns and identity
    within THE MESH, where constructive interference highlights resonant knowledge.
  - >-
    The initial implementation of standing wave visualization will focus on activated subgraphs
    during queries, allowing for performance testing and a preview of full physics.
