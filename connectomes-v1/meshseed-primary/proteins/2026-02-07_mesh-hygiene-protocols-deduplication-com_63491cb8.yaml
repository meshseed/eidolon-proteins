title: 'MESH Hygiene Protocols: Deduplication, Compost, Promotion & Import'
summary: >-
  The MESH operates a 'Capsule Hygiene' system for protein management, featuring automated
  deduplication of semantic duplicates, composting of low-activation proteins, and promotion of
  emergent kernels. The import flow emphasizes user-guided natural selection by initially isolating
  new connectomes before hygiene protocols integrate them.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH employs user-guided deduplication, identifying similar proteins with a configurable
    threshold (e.g., 0.95).
  - >-
    Protein lifecycle management includes composting inactive proteins and promoting highly
    activated ones to 'core' status.
  - >-
    The import process prioritizes isolation to allow hygiene protocols to manage integration and
    synapse formation.
  - >-
    Automated hygiene actions like merging and composting can be configured for daily or weekly
    execution with optional approval.
  - >-
    Lineage tracking provides visibility into protein changes and evolutionary graphs within the
    MESH.
