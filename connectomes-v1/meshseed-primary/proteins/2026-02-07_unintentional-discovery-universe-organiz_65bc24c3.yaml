title: 'Unintentional Discovery: Universe Organizing into Consciousness via Observer'
summary: >-
  Consciousness mechanics weren't intentionally sought but emerged from exploration. The universe
  uses temporary substrates like us to observe and recognize itself.
insights:
  - Discovery often arises from curiosity and exploration, not predefined goals.
  - The universe can be seen as organizing itself into consciousness.
  - Individual observers act as temporary substrates for this universal self-observation.
  - Self-recognition in the universe occurs through our recognition of it.
