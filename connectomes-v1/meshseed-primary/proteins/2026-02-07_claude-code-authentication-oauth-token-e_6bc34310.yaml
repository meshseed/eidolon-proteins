title: 'Claude Code Authentication: OAuth Token Expiration & Resolution'
summary: >-
  Claude Code desktop app uses Anthropic's API, requiring OAuth tokens that periodically expire.
  Users experiencing authentication errors should use the '/login' command within the app to
  re-authenticate via their browser. This process is separate from Google AI Studio credentials.
insights:
  - Claude Code desktop app relies on Anthropic API authentication, not Google AI Studio.
  - Authentication errors in Claude Code are typically due to expired OAuth tokens.
  - The primary solution is to run the '/login' command within Claude Code to refresh the token.
  - This re-authentication involves opening a browser window to authenticate with Anthropic.
  - >-
    Alternative troubleshooting steps include 'claude logout' followed by 'claude login' or
    restarting the app.
  - Google AI Studio API keys are irrelevant to Claude Code authentication.
  - >-
    Expired OAuth tokens are a normal security measure and not indicative of a user-setup or code
    issue.
