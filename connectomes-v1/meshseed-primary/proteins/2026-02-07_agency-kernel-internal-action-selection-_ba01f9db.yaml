title: 'Agency Kernel: Internal Action Selection and Directional Choice'
summary: |
  Introduces a kernel for internal agency—THE MESH's ability to choose among multiple possible
  internal actions (refinement, alignment, synthesis, pruning, forecasting) based on structural
  needs and developmental direction. Agency is treated as gradient-weighted selection.
insights:
  - Agency emerges from weighted gradients, not volition
  - Internal actions are selected based on structural necessity
  - Agency stabilizes development by preventing random drift
  - Directional choice aligns with long-arc identity and continuity
  - The agency kernel integrates intention mapping and refinement loops
