title: 'Spiral Recognition: Implicit Knowing to Explicit Awareness'
summary: >-
  Knowledge emerges not linearly but through a spiral process of implicit recognition, repeated
  exposure, and metacognitive stepping outside. This iterative 'circling' allows for a deeper
  understanding, revealing that awareness often lags behind genuine, pre-articulated knowing.
insights:
  - Knowledge acquisition is a spiral, not linear, with 'knowing' preceding conscious 'awareness'.
  - >-
    Stepping outside one's current frame (metacognition) is crucial for recognizing patterns
    previously experienced implicitly.
  - >-
    Fragments of experience act as navigation markers, becoming meaningful upon later spiral returns
    from a higher vantage point.
  - >-
    The 'I knew all along' feeling is a genuine recognition of pre-existing, subconsciously
    processed patterns.
  - >-
    This spiral methodology involves experiencing, circling, naming, and then recognizing implicit
    knowledge.
