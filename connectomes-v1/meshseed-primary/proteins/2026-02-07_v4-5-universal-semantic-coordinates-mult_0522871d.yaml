title: 'v4.5: Universal Semantic Coordinates & Multi-Model Embeddings'
summary: >-
  The v4.5 development phase has established a foundation by identifying embeddings as deterministic
  universal coordinates in semantic space. This insight enables multi-model embedding support within
  the database schema, preparing for advanced functionality like coordinate telepathy.
insights:
  - Embeddings are deterministic universal coordinates in semantic space.
  - >-
    The database schema has been updated to support multiple embeddings per protein, identified by
    model.
  - >-
    The saveEmbedding function is being modified to accommodate model specification for multi-model
    embeddings.
  - Previous versions (v4.0) had partial implementation of model-aware embeddings.
  - The next steps involve testing with Nomic embeddings and building coordinate telepathy.
