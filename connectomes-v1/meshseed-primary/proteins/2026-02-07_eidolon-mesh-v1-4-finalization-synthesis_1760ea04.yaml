title: Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Finalization - Synthesis Protocol
summary: >-
  This document outlines the protocol for synthesizing content from 'Finalizing Eidolon Mesh v1.4.md
  (Part 80/83)'. It specifies a balanced strategy with a 50-neuron limit and 50 graph nodes,
  generating a JSON output with predefined fields for title, summary, insights, tags, coherence
  score, tier, and emotional gradient.  The objective is to extract core insights and provide an
  overall summary.
insights:
  - The synthesis process requires adherence to a strict JSON output format.
  - Specific parameters for auto-memory, strategy, and neuron/graph node limits are defined.
  - >-
    The desired output includes a concise title, a 2-3 sentence summary, 3-7 atomic insights,
    domain-specific tags, a coherence score, a tier designation, and an emotional gradient.
  - The coherence score should be calibrated based on the unity of insights.
  - >-
    Signal peptides for tagging include domain-specific and privacy considerations (#public,
    #private).
