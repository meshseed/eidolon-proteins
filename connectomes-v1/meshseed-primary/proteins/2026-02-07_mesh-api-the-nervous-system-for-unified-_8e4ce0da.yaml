title: 'MESH API: The Nervous System for Unified AI Architecture'
summary: >-
  The MESH architecture proposes GitHub as DNA storage, with the MESH API acting as the central
  nervous system to connect AI agents like Claude and Copilot. Implementing this API is the critical
  path to enabling seamless knowledge transfer and holistic organismic function.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH architecture defines GitHub as data storage and the MESH API as the connective tissue
    (nervous system) for AI agents.
  - >-
    The MESH API is identified as the critical path for unifying disparate AI components and
    enabling seamless knowledge transfer.
  - >-
    Successful implementation of the MESH API will resolve current limitations like
    context-blindness and manual knowledge transfer.
  - The goal is for the integrated system to function as a single, cohesive organism.
