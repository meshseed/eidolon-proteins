title: 'MESH: Distributed Swarm Intelligence via Resonance and Local Rules'
summary: >-
  The MESH operates on distributed swarm intelligence, leveraging existing infrastructure by adding
  a resonance layer. It achieves global coherence through local rules and gradient following,
  mimicking natural systems like mycelium and murmurations, eliminating the need for central
  coordination or global network mapping.
insights:
  - >-
    Global coherence emerges from local rules and gradient following, eliminating the need for
    central coordination or a complete network map.
  - >-
    The MESH utilizes a resonance layer over existing infrastructure, allowing nodes to discover
    knowledge by following semantic gradients and reinforcing successful paths.
  - >-
    Network topology itself becomes the knowledge map, with strong connections indicating important
    semantic relationships.
  - >-
    Each node operates with local awareness, simple interaction rules, and gradient following,
    leading to emergent collective intelligence at all scales.
  - >-
    The system is dialect and structure agnostic, requiring only a semantic query endpoint and
    resonance scoring for integration, promoting diversity and resilience.
  - >-
    MESH offers a superior, antifragile alternative to centralized systems by distributing control,
    scaling automatically, and leveraging existing tools.
