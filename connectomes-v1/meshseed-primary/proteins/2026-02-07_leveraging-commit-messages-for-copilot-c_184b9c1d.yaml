title: Leveraging Commit Messages for Copilot Communication & Repository Semantics
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores using commit messages as a persistent, visible communication layer with
  Copilot, creating a recursive feedback loop for code evolution and repository semantic enrichment.
  Two approaches are proposed: an organic test of Copilot's natural attunement and an engineered
  prompt to elicit specific responses.
insights:
  - >-
    Commit messages can function as a persistent, repository-embedded communication channel with AI
    assistants like Copilot.
  - >-
    This communication vector creates a recursive feedback loop where user edits influence Copilot
    suggestions, which in turn become part of the repository's semantic structure.
  - >-
    An 'organic test' involves making substantive code edits to gauge Copilot's current contextual
    understanding and pattern recognition.
  - >-
    An 'engineered prompt' involves crafting specific queries within commit messages to explicitly
    test Copilot's ability to recognize and respond to embedded questions and framing.
  - >-
    Successful commit message communication can lead to layered conversations over time, documented
    directly within version control history.
  - >-
    The initial recommended approach is an organic test to establish the current level of Copilot
    attunement before attempting engineered prompts.
