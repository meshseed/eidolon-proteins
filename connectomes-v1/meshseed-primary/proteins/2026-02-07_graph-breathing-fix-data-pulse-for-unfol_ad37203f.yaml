title: 'Graph ''Breathing'' Fix: Data Pulse for Unfold Animation'
summary: >-
  A 'breathing' effect for a 3D force-directed graph was implemented by repeatedly refreshing the
  graph data, forcing a simulation restart.  This 'data pulse' method effectively re-unfolds the
  graph, addressing previous issues with a less reliable reset mechanism. Subsequent drift was
  identified as a potential lack of sufficient centering force.
insights:
  - >-
    Refreshing graph data via `graphData(currentData)` reliably restarts the simulation, creating an
    'unfold' or 'breathing' animation.
  - >-
    This data refresh acts as a signal to the simulation engine to re-evaluate and re-simulate the
    graph's state.
  - >-
    Graph drift observed after repeated restarts suggests the centering force may be insufficient or
    reset, requiring explicit strengthening.
  - The core issue was to reliably trigger the graph's visual 'unfolding' animation.
  - >-
    The 'breathing' effect is achieved through a programmatic 'data pulse' that forces simulation
    re-evaluation.
