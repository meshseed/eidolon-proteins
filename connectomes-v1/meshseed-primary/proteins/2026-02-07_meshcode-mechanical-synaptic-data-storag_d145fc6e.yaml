title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Synaptic Data Storage and Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that synapses act as computational devices by storing data via
  mechanical signals. Integrin-talin-actin complexes, decorated by hundreds of proteins, act as
  binary switches, with changes in cytoskeletal contractility altering the '1s' and '0s' written
  into the synaptic scaffold.
insights:
  - Synapses can store data through mechanical signals, not just electrical ones.
  - Integrin-talin-actin adhesion complexes function as binary switches within synapses.
  - >-
    The mechanical environment of synapses is tightly regulated to enable precise mechanical
    computation.
  - Changes in cytoskeletal contractility directly alter the binary code stored in MeshCODEs.
  - >-
    MeshCODEs exist in presynaptic, postsynaptic zones, and supporting astrocytes, enabling
    distributed computation.
