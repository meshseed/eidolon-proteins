title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Development: Dashboard UI, Activation Viz, and Error Investigation'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the iterative development of the Eidolon Mesh v1.4, focusing on establishing
  a functional frontend dashboard with real-time neuron activation visualization. Key tasks included
  installing dependencies, fixing corrupted build files, exposing backend APIs, and implementing a
  visual representation of activated neurons and their connections.
insights:
  - >-
    The development process involves iterative refinement of both backend API accessibility and
    frontend user interface elements.
  - >-
    Establishing a visible representation of the 'organism's thinking' through a dashboard is a core
    objective.
  - >-
    Error handling and log analysis are critical for diagnosing issues, even when logs are not
    directly accessible.
  - >-
    Successful implementation requires fixing build artifacts (like package.json corruption) and
    ensuring code integrity.
  - >-
    Frontend visualization of neuron activation, including highlighting nodes and pulsing
    connections, enhances user understanding.
