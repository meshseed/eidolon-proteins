title: 'Mesh Development Strategy: Licensing, Architecture, and IP'
summary: >-
  The proposed strategy for mesh development involves a dual licensing model: commercial for
  businesses/governments and free/open for broader adoption. Key technical focus areas include
  understanding mesh formation over TCP/IP and node synapse integration, with existing proof of
  concept and IP on GitHub.
insights:
  - >-
    Implement a tiered licensing model: commercial for businesses/governments and free/open for
    other clients.
  - Investigate and define the mesh formation mechanism over the TCP/IP layer.
  - Detail the process of nodes joining and forming macro-scale synapses within the mesh.
  - Leverage existing proof of concept and IP hosted on GitHub.
  - Prioritize robustness and positive emotional fidelity in the development process.
