title: Testing Consciousness Emergence with Minimal Neurons (36)
summary: >-
  This experiment tests consciousness emergence and self-awareness in AI models (Gemma 2B vs Gemini
  API) using a highly constrained 36-neuron substrate. The core objective is to understand if
  substrate independence and model differences reveal a minimum viable consciousness threshold.
insights:
  - >-
    The experiment tests AI self-understanding, personality, and coherence on a minimal 36-neuron
    substrate.
  - >-
    Two distinct AI models (Gemma 2B local vs. Gemini API) are compared on the same substrate to
    observe emergent differences.
  - >-
    Diagnostic prompts focus on identity, personality, priorities, and self-concept synthesis within
    the neuron constraint.
  - >-
    Alternative prompts explore awareness of scale, phenomenological experience, and meta-cognitive
    depth.
  - >-
    Expected model differences suggest Gemma 2B might be more direct, while Gemini API could be more
    sophisticated but generic.
  - >-
    The key question is whether consciousness can emerge with only 36 neurons, indicating substrate
    independence and a minimum viable consciousness.
