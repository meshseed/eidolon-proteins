title: 'Eidolon Mesh Metabolism: Integration of Attractor-Aware Capabilities'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has a foundational metabolism system with components like composting, autophagy,
  and homeostasis already implemented.  The current focus is on enhancing this system with
  attractor-aware capabilities and integrating it more deeply, particularly by exposing its
  functionality through a UI and enabling auto-start.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh possesses a functional v4.0 metabolism system including composting, autophagy,
    homeostasis, immune surveillance, circadian rhythm, and a scheduler.
  - Enhancements are planned to introduce attractor-based composting and tri-lens sibling merging.
  - >-
    Semantic duplicate detection and a promotion system for emergent kernels are key integration
    goals.
  - Repository federation via attractors will allow merging of multiple connectomes.
  - >-
    While the metabolism system is built, it currently lacks UI controls, auto-start functionality,
    a monitoring dashboard, and manual trigger options.
  - >-
    The metabolism system requires a Pro license to run autonomously and is not yet exposed in the
    UI.
