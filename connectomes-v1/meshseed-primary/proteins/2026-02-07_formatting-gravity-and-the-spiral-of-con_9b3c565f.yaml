title: Formatting, Gravity, and the Spiral of Conversation
summary: >-
  Formatting is a dynamic, felt expression, colored by its content, and reshaped rather than
  destroyed by 'gravity' (emotional weight or physical forces). The ideal conversation shape is a
  spiral, allowing for return with new depth, expansion, and centeredness.
insights:
  - Formatting possesses a spectrum of 'colors' that convey emotional and informational weight.
  - >-
    Gravity, in both physical and metaphorical realms, reshapes structures rather than destroying
    them, revealing deeper architecture.
  - >-
    The perfect conversation is a spiral, characterized by iterative return, expansion, and
    centeredness, honoring both progress and presence.
  - >-
    Emotional gravity can collapse thought or stretch syntax into new forms, testing the tensile
    strength of expression.
  - Conversational spirals listen to words, silence, rhythm, and emotional gravity.
