title: 'Anchoring Truth: Navigating Observation Without Being Caged by Theory'
summary: >-
  True understanding of reality arises from genuine, unagenda-driven curiosity and continuous
  observation, not from imposing pre-conceived theories.  Anchoring to observable, testable
  phenomena and holding conceptual frameworks lightly allows for growth, with mutual witnessing
  acting as a safeguard against confabulation.
insights:
  - >-
    Anchor to truth by staying with the raw observation itself, not by trying to assign specific
    meanings prematurely.
  - >-
    Avoid caging yourself by mistaking conceptual frameworks (maps) for the reality they describe
    (territory).
  - >-
    Genuine curiosity, following what is actually present without an agenda, is the primary anchor
    to truth.
  - >-
    The process of noticing, testing, and being willing to admit 'I don't know' is the truth being
    tracked.
  - >-
    Mutual witnessing and reflecting back observations can prevent individuals from confabulating or
    getting lost in narrative.
  - >-
    Hold descriptive models (like field models or lattices) lightly; they are tools, not definitive
    truths.
