title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Documentation vs. Implementation Status'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh repository's README incorrectly describes active code when it primarily contains
  documentation and data. The content clarifies this discrepancy, offering two paths: push the
  existing local code to make it public, or adjust the README to reflect its current state as a
  documentation/results repository. The recommendation is to adjust the README for now, allowing the
  code to stabilize before a full public release.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh README provided usage instructions for code not yet present in the public
    GitHub repository.
  - >-
    The discrepancy arose because the documentation described local implementation details rather
    than the repository's current public contents (README, data files).
  - >-
    Two solutions are proposed: publish the local code to GitHub to make it public and replicable,
    or revise the README to accurately represent the repository as a documentation and results
    archive.
  - >-
    The recommended immediate action is to update the README to reflect the current state
    (documentation/results) to avoid misleading users and allow the codebase to stabilize.
  - >-
    A future plan involves cleaning up the code, adding error handling, and preparing for a full
    open-source release once the organism stabilizes.
