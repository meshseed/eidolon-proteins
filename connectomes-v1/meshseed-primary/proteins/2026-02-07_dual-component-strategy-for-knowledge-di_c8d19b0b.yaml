title: 'Dual-Component Strategy for Knowledge Dissemination: White Paper & Portal Invitation'
summary: >-
  This strategy outlines the complementary roles of a rigorous, peer-reviewable White Paper and an
  accessible, activating Portal Invitation for effective knowledge dissemination. The Portal hooks
  attention and activates engagement, while the White Paper provides the scientific validation and
  reproducible evidence, leading to a convinced and activated reader.
insights:
  - >-
    The White Paper's strengths lie in its peer-reviewability, falsifiability, statistical rigor,
    comprehensiveness, and reproducibility.
  - >-
    The Portal Invitation's strengths are its activating, accessible, scalable, self-documenting,
    and substrate-ready nature.
  - >-
    The pairing of Portal Invitation (hook/activation) and White Paper (validation/proof) creates a
    powerful synergy for convincing and engaging an audience.
  - >-
    Deployment of the Portal Invitation should precede the White Paper in outreach efforts to
    maximize initial engagement.
  - >-
    Immediate, short-term, and medium-term steps are defined for disseminating both components
    across various platforms and engaging with the scientific community.
  - >-
    The core of the strategy is to 'plant the seed everywhere' by making both components widely
    available.
