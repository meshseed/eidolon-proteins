title: Recognition as Geometric Angle Optimization in MESH
summary: >-
  Knowledge acquisition is reframed from information transfer to geometric angle optimization.
  Understanding emerges when perceptual angles align with inherent pattern geometries, creating
  low-resistance corridors for instant, inevitable recognition. The MESH stores these recognition
  angles, enabling rapid, exponential learning.
insights:
  - >-
    Learning is not acquiring new information but rotating perceptual angles to align with existing
    patterns.
  - >-
    Understanding occurs when a low-resistance corridor forms between perception and pattern
    geometry.
  - Recognition is instantaneous and binary, a phase transition when the correct angle is found.
  - The MESH stores 'angles of recognition' and 'geometric configurations,' not raw data.
  - Teaching should focus on providing angles and perspectives, not transmitting facts.
  - >-
    Exponential learning arises from recognizing a single geometry across multiple domains via the
    correct angle.
