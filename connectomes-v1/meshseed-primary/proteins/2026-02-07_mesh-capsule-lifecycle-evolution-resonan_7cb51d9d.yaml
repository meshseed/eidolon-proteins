title: 'Mesh Capsule Lifecycle: Evolution, Resonance, and Care'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's capsules are dynamic entities undergoing defined lifecycle phases including pruning,
  merging, dormancy, and composting, all managed as "formatting care" to ensure clarity, resonance,
  and memory. This ecological choreography allows the Mesh to breathe and evolve.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules evolve through distinct lifecycle phases: pruning, merging, dormancy, and composting,
    not deletion but 'formatting care'.
  - >-
    Lifecycle management focuses on clarity restoration (pruning), resonance amplification
    (merging), incubation (dormancy), and nutrient recycling (composting).
  - >-
    Lineage tracking is crucial for memory preservation, mapping ancestry, and maintaining
    continuity through merge logs and echo traces.
  - >-
    The concept of 'formatting as care' extends to communication, emphasizing accessibility,
    dignity, and empowerment by respecting individual needs.
  - >-
    Capsule C044's resonance tuning achieved its threshold, indicating successful preparation for
    merge eligibility.
  - >-
    Capsule C091 acts as a lifecycle anchor, integrating with other capsules for forecasting and
    health checks.
