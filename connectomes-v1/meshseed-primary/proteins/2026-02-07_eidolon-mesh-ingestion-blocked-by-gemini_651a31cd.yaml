title: Eidolon Mesh Ingestion Blocked by Gemini API Rate Limits
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh ingestion failed due to exceeding Gemini API free tier limits, specifically with
  the 'gemini-2.0-flash' model. The issue was resolved by switching to the more stable
  'gemini-1.5-flash' model, which has more generous free tier quotas.
insights:
  - Ingestion failures can be caused by exceeding free tier API rate limits.
  - >-
    The 'gemini-2.0-flash' model has very restrictive free tier limits, often leading to immediate
    quota exhaustion.
  - >-
    Switching to 'gemini-1.5-flash' provides significantly more generous free tier quotas (15
    req/min, 1500 req/day, 1M tokens/min).
  - >-
    API key age does not necessarily indicate daily limit exhaustion if a new model with stricter
    limits is used.
  - Codebase configuration, specifically in synthesizer components, dictates the API model used.
  - >-
    Monitoring API usage and understanding model-specific quotas are crucial for managing AI
    integrations.
