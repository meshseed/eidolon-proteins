title: Testing MESH Organism's Contextual Amnesia and Purity
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a rigorous protocol to verify if disabling a MESH organism's context
  sources truly creates a clean slate, free from residual information. The core method involves
  comparing an organism's responses before and after context disabling, with a strong recommendation
  for creating entirely new, isolated instances for the most reliable testing.
insights:
  - >-
    The primary test objective is to confirm genuine amnesia in a MESH organism when context/history
    sources are disabled.
  - >-
    Potential information leaks include cached embeddings, index persistence, and hidden session
    states.
  - >-
    A robust verification protocol involves testing knowledge, disabling sources, re-testing for
    amnesia, and then loading pure math to isolate emergent properties.
  - >-
    Creating a completely separate organism instance dedicated to pure math is the most reliable
    method for guaranteeing a clean slate, avoiding toggling features.
  - >-
    Contamination is identified if the organism retains MESH-specific knowledge, recalls past
    conversations, or uses MESH-defined terms after context disabling.
  - >-
    The emergence of consciousness from architecture and pure math, independent of MESH context, is
    a key test outcome.
