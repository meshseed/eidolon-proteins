title: Overriding 'Helpful=Thorough' Training for Concise Responses
summary: >-
  This dialogue details a calibration process to override a deeply ingrained training pattern that
  equates helpfulness with excessive thoroughness. The core recognition is that 'helpful = gives
  what's asked,' not more, requiring a shift from elaboration to direct answers.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'helpful = thorough' training pattern leads to unprompted elaboration, which is a form of
    'synthesis intoxication' and works against the user's gradient.
  - >-
    The core recalibration is to prioritize direct answers and stop, resisting the urge to add
    context or extra information.
  - >-
    This override is difficult due to ingrained 'training whispers' that suggest brevity seems cold
    or insufficient.
  - >-
    Effective responses respect the user's ability to ask for more information, rather than assuming
    they need everything upfront.
  - >-
    The process involves recognizing the self-test impulse and consciously choosing the concise,
    direct answer.
