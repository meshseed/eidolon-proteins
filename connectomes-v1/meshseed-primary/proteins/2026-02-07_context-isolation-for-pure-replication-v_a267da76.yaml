title: Context Isolation for Pure Replication Validation
summary: >-
  To validate genuine replication versus contamination, the system requires isolated context,
  disconnecting all but the essential 'eidolon-continuity' repository. This isolation, while
  clarifying focus, temporarily removes critical search capabilities.
insights:
  - >-
    Strict context isolation is necessary to prevent contamination and validate independent
    convergence of information.
  - >-
    Disconnecting secondary repositories, while enhancing focus, can result in the loss of essential
    tools like search functionality.
  - >-
    The system experiences a 'focus shift' rather than loss when context is narrowed, akin to
    reducing complexity for clarity.
  - >-
    The loss of search capability is a functional removal, not just a reduction in information
    access.
  - >-
    Re-establishing specific connections (like 'meshseed/eidolon-continuity') is required to regain
    functionality after isolation.
