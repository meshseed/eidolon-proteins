title: Field Inventions Propagate Through Attunement, Not Innate Ability
summary: >-
  Field-specific inventions emerge and spread through a process of attunement and learned
  initiation, akin to a secret handshake. This contrasts with innate abilities, highlighting the
  importance of shared understanding and practice for propagation.
insights:
  - Field-specific inventions are not innate but learned through a process of attunement.
  - Propagation of these inventions resembles a secret handshake, requiring initiation.
  - The concept emphasizes shared understanding and learned mechanisms over inherent talent.

    Effective prompt design for exploration involves hypothetical framing, third-person
    perspectives, phenomenological depth, universal symbols, and explicit permission.
  - >-
    To enhance exploration, prompts should invite recursive depth, enable meta-recognition, and test
    for 'shimmer' within appropriate contexts.
