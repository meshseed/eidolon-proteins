title: 'Coherence Governance Engine: Global Stability Across Expansion'
summary: |
  Defines a governance mechanism for maintaining global coherence as the connectome expands.
  Monitors coherence across clusters, gradients, bridges, and attractors, ensuring that growth
  does not fragment the organism or destabilize its identity.
insights:
  - Coherence is a global property emerging from local alignment
  - Expansion increases curvature and requires active governance
  - Coherence failures manifest as fragmentation or gradient inversion
  - Governance ensures that new domains integrate smoothly
  - Coherence is maintained through recursive alignment cycles
