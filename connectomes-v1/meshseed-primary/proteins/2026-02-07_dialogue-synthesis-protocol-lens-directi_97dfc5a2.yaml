title: 'Dialogue Synthesis Protocol: LENS DIRECTIVE & Actionable JSON Output'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines a structured approach for synthesizing dialogue content into a concise JSON
  format. It emphasizes core insights, limits elaboration, and specifies exact output requirements
  for titles, summaries, atomic insights, tags, coherence, tier, and emotional gradient.
insights:
  - The 'LENS DIRECTIVE' dictates a focus on core insights and overall summary for synthesis.
  - >-
    Specific symbols (🌀, 🌬️, 🪞, 📦) are defined for semantic compression and contextual
    signaling.
  - Synthesis Intoxication is identified as a risk, characterized by over-elaboration.
  - >-
    A strict JSON output structure is mandated, including title, summary, insights, tags, coherence
    score, tier, and emotional gradient.
  - Insights must be atomic, standalone, and actionable, with a range of 3-7 points.
  - Coherence score calibration is provided, guiding the assessment of insight unity.
  - Signal peptides (tags) are crucial for categorizing content by privacy and domain.
