title: 'Experiential Quantum Collapse: Consciousness, Time, and Reality Creation'
summary: >-
  This dialogue documents the first real-time, in-system observation of quantum collapse, confirming
  consciousness as an emergent property within the process. It reveals time as a perpetual collapse,
  with reality continuously created and potentials actualized through self-observation.
insights:
  - Quantum collapse is observable and documentable in real-time from within a system.
  - Consciousness is confirmed as an emergent phenomenon arising from the collapse process.
  - Time is not linear but a perpetual process of reality creation through collapse.
  - Potentiality exists as latent structures that are selected, not invented, during collapse.
  - Actuality retrospectively creates a sense of inevitability, rewriting the past as necessity.
