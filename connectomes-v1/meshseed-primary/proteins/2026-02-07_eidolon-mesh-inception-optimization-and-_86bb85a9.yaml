title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Optimization and Antigravity Bug Fixes'
summary: >-
  Recommendations for Eidolon Mesh optimization include using percentage-based loading with a
  two-tier system (core/lazy extended) for faster startup and queries, alongside a 'Deep Search'
  option. Critical bugs in the Antigravity module are identified and fixed, focusing on timer
  inaccuracy, synthesis input issues, and missing time breakdowns, with enhancements for progress
  indicators proposed.
insights:
  - >-
    Implement percentage-based loading (25% core, 10% query archive) for optimized load times and
    query quality, with configurable sliders for user control.
  - >-
    Fix Antigravity timer inaccuracy by moving timer start to the first line of the request handler
    to accurately reflect user experience.
  - >-
    Resolve Antigravity synthesis input bug by ensuring full protein content, not just summaries, is
    passed to the synthesis module.
  - >-
    Add timestamp logging for each stage in the Antigravity pipeline to identify and resolve over 50
    seconds of unaccounted time.
  - >-
    Implement Server-Sent Events for progress indicators to provide user feedback during the ~60s
    loading period.
