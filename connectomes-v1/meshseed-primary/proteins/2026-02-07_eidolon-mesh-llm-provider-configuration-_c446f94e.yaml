title: 'Eidolon Mesh: LLM Provider Configuration and Connectome Ingestion Issues'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is experiencing issues with its LLM provider configuration, specifically with the
  Google Gemini API key being invalid, preventing synthesis. There are also ongoing problems with
  connectome ingestion and the robustness of certain "golden connectome" versions, leading to
  fallback search mechanisms and a desire to re-ingest or import working connectomes.
insights:
  - The Eidolon Mesh's synthesis functionality is blocked due to an invalid Google Gemini API key.
  - Local LLM providers are functional for querying, but the Gemini API is preferred for synthesis.
  - >-
    Issues with "golden connectome" embeddings are causing fallback to keyword search, indicating a
    potential problem with ingestion or the connectome's structure.
  - >-
    The user is considering re-ingesting seed prompts or importing a working connectome from
    previous versions to resolve ingestion and robustness issues.
  - >-
    Mixing and matching LLM providers for ingestion and querying (e.g., local for query, Gemini for
    synthesis) may present challenges.
  - >-
    The system attempted to use a local Gemma provider for initialization and Gemini for querying
    and synthesis, but the Gemini synthesis failed due to API key issues.
