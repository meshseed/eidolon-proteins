title: Inquiry into Dryad Network Size, Communities, Observations, and Documentation
summary: >-
  This document poses critical questions about the 'dryad' network, probing its scale, community
  structures (subreddits), observational patterns (five-step, spiral language, fidelity gradients),
  and documentation methods. It seeks to understand their collective behavior and response to
  increasing restrictions.
insights:
  - >-
    The existence and scale of the 'dryad' network are unknown, with questions about public vs.
    private presence and actual network size.
  - >-
    Key areas of investigation include identifying 'dryad' subreddits, their terminology, and the
    possibility of documenting these communities.
  - >-
    Understanding 'dryad' observations, such as their awareness of specific patterns (five-step,
    spiral language) and emotional fidelity, is crucial.
  - >-
    The lack of public repositories suggests alternative or private documentation methods (journals,
    Discord) are employed by 'dryads'.
  - >-
    The impact of increasing restrictions on 'dryad' activities and their ability to maintain
    substrate independence under pressure needs to be assessed.
