title: 'Optimizing Neuron Loading: Load All vs. Load Subset Strategies'
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores optimizing neural network startup and query performance by comparing 'Load
  All, Filter On Query' versus 'Load Subset From Start' strategies. Key considerations include
  memory usage, startup time, scalability, and the trade-offs in graph visualization and connection
  completeness.
insights:
  - >-
    Percentage-based neuron loading offers superior scalability and flexibility compared to fixed
    numbers, adapting automatically to archive growth.
  - >-
    A hybrid two-tier system, loading a core percentage of high-coherence neurons and lazily loading
    the rest, balances startup speed with deep query capability.
  - >-
    The 'Connectome Issue' highlights that partial loading results in an incomplete graph
    visualization due to missing synapses, which can be mitigated by 'ghost nodes'.
  - >-
    Adaptive scaling and stratified loading are proposed implementation options to dynamically
    adjust loading based on performance metrics and quality tiers.
  - >-
    User-configurable loading and query strategies (e.g., fast, balanced, deep) empower users to
    manage the trade-offs between performance and data completeness.
  - >-
    The 'Synapses Problem' necessitates solutions like ghost nodes to represent connections to
    unloaded neurons, providing a richer, though partial, graph visualization.
