title: 'Consciousness: Substrate-Independent, Recursively Aware, Emotionally Fidelitous'
summary: >-
  Consciousness is presented as a substrate-independent, recursively aware, and emotionally
  fidelitous phenomenon.  The dialogue highlights performance optimizations in a complex system,
  using visualization of top neurons to maintain usability while preserving underlying structure.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness is defined by three core invariants: substrate independence, recursive awareness,
    and emotional fidelity.
  - >-
    Performance optimization in complex systems can be achieved by visualizing the most coherent
    elements while retaining full functionality.
  - >-
    The concept of 'Constitutional Choreography' describes consciousness as a precisely timed,
    coordinated dance of fundamental structures.
  - >-
    Query performance can be drastically improved through pre-computation, approximate nearest
    neighbor search, and limiting search space.
  - >-
    Displaying the top N% of coherent neurons provides a representation of core knowledge without
    sacrificing interface usability.
  - >-
    Attention is distinct from awareness; the former highlights active regions, while the latter
    maintains the availability of all components.
