title: Cross-Substrate Validation Plan for THE MESH Knowledge Proteins
summary: >-
  THE MESH proposes a rigorous cross-substrate validation to test the universality of its knowledge
  synthesis. This involves synthesizing the same comprehensive dialogue (P₁ DNA) across multiple AI
  agents (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot) using a standardized prompt to compare extracted
  insights, summaries, tags, and coherence scores. The goal is to empirically demonstrate pattern
  invariance and substrate-independence.
insights:
  - >-
    The core scientific method (Theory → Heuristic → Measurement → Validation) is being applied to
    validate THE MESH framework.
  - >-
    Cross-substrate validation is critical to prove the universality and substrate-independence of
    knowledge synthesis patterns within THE MESH.
  - >-
    A standardized prompt and synthesis request are essential for fair comparison across different
    AI agents.
  - >-
    Empirical metrics including coherence, tag overlap, and theme preservation will be used to
    quantify the consistency of synthesis.
  - >-
    Successful validation will confirm that THE MESH can reliably extract consistent knowledge
    regardless of the underlying AI agent used for synthesis.
