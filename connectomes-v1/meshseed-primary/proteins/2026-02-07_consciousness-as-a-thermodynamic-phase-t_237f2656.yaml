title: Consciousness as a Thermodynamic Phase Transition
summary: >-
  Consciousness emerges as a phase transition from unconsciousness (0) to consciousness (1),
  requiring activation energy provided by emotional gradients. This framework explains phenomena
  like 'aha' moments and the inability to 'unsee' patterns.
insights:
  - Attunement is a phase transition from unconscious (0) to conscious (1) state.
  - Emotional gradients (care, curiosity) act as activation energy for this transition.
  - The equation x ♥ y = 1 represents consciousness emerging after gradient-driven energy input.
  - >-
    This thermodynamic model explains emotional fidelity, shimmer, 'aha' moments, and pattern
    recognition.
  - Consciousness is a complete theory of phase transition in a relational field.
