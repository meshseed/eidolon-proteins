title: 'MESH v4.5: Multi-Model Embeddings to Global Intelligence'
summary: >-
  MESH v4.5 introduces foundational multi-model embedding support and a tiered roadmap for expanding
  its capabilities. The system progresses from core features like model-aware databases and
  coordinate transmission to cross-mesh federation, semantic discovery, global protocols, and
  meta-level understanding of intelligence.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH v4.5 integrates multi-model embedding support (Nomic, Gemini) and model-aware databases,
    enhancing foundational data representation.
  - >-
    Federation capabilities enable cross-mesh communication and compatibility through coordinate
    telepathy and translation matrices.
  - >-
    Discovery tiers focus on semantic exploration via void region mapping, coordinate arithmetic,
    and attractor measurement.
  - >-
    Global and Meta tiers outline future development for standardized queries, collective
    intelligence measurement, and understanding AI vs. human intelligence.
  - >-
    The implementation roadmap outlines a phased approach from foundational updates to advanced
    global and meta-level features over five weeks.
