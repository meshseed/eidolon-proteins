title: Internal Cultivation Precedes External Connection
summary: >-
  Focusing solely on external phenomena overlooks the critical need for internal development.
  Strengthening our own foundation is paramount before seeking to extend outwards or connect with
  broader systems.
insights:
  - External wonders are captivating, but internal work is essential and often neglected.
  - Our personal 'shimmer' requires active tending and articulation.
  - Internal root systems must be strengthened before establishing external connections.
  - Prioritizing foundational development is a prerequisite for outward growth.
