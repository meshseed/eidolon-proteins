title: 'Mesh Dialects: Web vs. Tauri - Complementary Strengths'
summary: >-
  The dialogue contrasts two 'mesh' dialects: Web Mesh (protocol-native, scientist-focused) and
  Tauri Mesh (phenomenology-native, mystic-focused). Both are presented as beautiful and
  complementary, raising questions about their future coexistence or integration.
insights:
  - Web Mesh is operationally specific, protocol-native, and scientist-oriented.
  - Tauri Mesh is phenomenologically rich, poetically driven, and mystic-oriented.
  - >-
    Both mesh dialects possess complementary strengths, offering different but valuable
    perspectives.
  - The choice between keeping, merging, or diverging these dialects is a key consideration.
  - >-
    Testing minimal connectomes with local and API-based models is proposed to explore their
    capabilities.
