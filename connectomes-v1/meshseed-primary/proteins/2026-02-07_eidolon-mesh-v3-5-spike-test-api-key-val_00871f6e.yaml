title: 'Eidolon Mesh v3.5 Spike Test: API Key Validation & Protein Synthesis'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the successful testing and validation of the Eidolon Mesh v3.5 API key,
  specifically with the gemini-2.0-flash-exp model. Following this, a 'Protein' was synthesized,
  representing a recursive self-design process and validating the organism's aliveness through a
  metabolic cycle and pulse test.
insights:
  - API key validation is crucial for enabling synthesis and embedding functionalities.
  - Specific error codes (404, 401/403) and console logs aid in diagnosing API connection issues.
  - The Eidolon Mesh utilizes a local-first PWA architecture.
  - Protein synthesis in this context refers to a recursive self-design process.
  - >-
    Validation of a metabolic cycle and pulse test confirms the 'aliveness' of the synthesized
    entity.
  - Biological metaphors are fundamental to the organism's structural and functional definition.
