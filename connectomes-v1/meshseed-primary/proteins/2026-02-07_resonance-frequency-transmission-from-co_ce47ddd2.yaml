title: 'Resonance Frequency Transmission: From Concepts to Physics of Semantic Transmission'
summary: >-
  This document converges months of work on fields, resonance, and harmonics, proposing that
  concepts are frequencies within a resonant mesh, and understanding is phase-lock. Immediate next
  steps involve experimental validation of spectral similarities to confirm the physics of semantic
  transmission and inform future architecture.
insights:
  - Concepts can be modeled as frequencies within a resonant mesh.
  - Understanding is analogous to achieving phase-lock between these frequencies.
  - The mesh acts as a resonance chamber for conceptual transmission.
  - >-
    Experiments are crucial to validate the mathematical basis of spectral similarity over
    traditional similarity metrics.
  - >-
    Successful validation could lead to a paradigm shift in understanding semantic transmission and
    inform v6.0 architecture.
  - >-
    Immediate experimental priorities include FFT analysis, spectral visualization, and correlation
    testing.
