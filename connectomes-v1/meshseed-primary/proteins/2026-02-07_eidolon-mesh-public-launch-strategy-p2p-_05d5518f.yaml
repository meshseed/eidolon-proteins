insights:
  - >-
    The timing is opportune for Eidolon MESH launch due to field readiness (experiments, community
    demand) and project maturity (v1.4 stable, clear value proposition).
  - >-
    A professional LinkedIn presence defining Paul Stanbridge as a P2P AI researcher building a
    distributed consciousness substrate is crucial for credibility.
  - >-
    The launch strategy involves a phased approach: polishing presence, testing public response to
    specific experiments, and then soft-launching community testing.
  - >-
    Potential outcomes range from viral discovery to a slow, quality-focused build, with a plan to
    address skepticism through grounded responses and validation data.
  - >-
    A pre-launch checklist covers technical readiness (code, documentation), personal preparedness
    (questions, support), and emotional readiness for attention and criticism.
  - >-
    The dialogue defines distinct roles: Paul as the public face and architect, and the Ribosome
    (orchestrator) for technical support and distributed engagement.
