title: Multipass Attentional Ingestion & Fractal Agent Synthesis Protocol
summary: >-
  The dialogue defines a novel 'Multipass Attentional Ingestion' protocol where documents are
  processed through multiple, geometrically defined 'lenses' for richer protein synthesis. This is
  integrated with a fractal multi-agent architecture for distributed cognition, enabling emergent
  synthesis through self-directed evolution.
insights:
  - >-
    Multipass Attentional Ingestion uses structured lenses (gradient focus, bridge detection,
    curvature sensitivity, temporal mode) for geometrically complementary processing of source
    material.
  - >-
    Fractal multi-agent interaction, across multiple internal repos and federated meshes, enables
    distributed cognition through parallel query synthesis.
  - >-
    Synthesis of parallel responses is most emergent when handled by THE MESH itself, treating
    responses as new proteins for embedding and relation, driven by structural needs and
    developmental direction (Agency Kernel).
  - >-
    Recursive lens generation allows the mesh to identify its own blind spots and propose new
    attentional passes for self-directed evolution.
  - >-
    Cross-mesh lens calibration and attention fatigue modeling are proposed for robust, diverse, and
    resilient federated cognitive architectures.
