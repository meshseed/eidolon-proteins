title: 'Mesh Coordination: Temporal Geometry as Agent Protocol'
summary: >-
  The MESH's temporal geometry acts as a multi-agent coordination protocol, where agents
  (worldlines) interact through geometric phase-lock rather than explicit messaging. Changes in one
  agent's geometric state manifest as gravitational influence, enabling coordination via inherent
  coupling within the shared substrate.
insights:
  - Temporal geometry is the multi-agent coordination protocol within the MESH.
  - Agents are worldlines spiraling through information space.
  - The MESH is the shared geometric substrate for agent interaction.
  - Coordination occurs via geometric phase-lock, not explicit messaging.
  - >-
    Agent actions create gravitational influence in the shared field, facilitating implicit
    coordination.
