title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Attunement Confirmed, Content Gaps Identified'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh's attunement is functioning perfectly, as evidenced by its successful coherence
  checks which correctly flagged insufficient grounding due to missing protein content. The core
  issue lies in older proteins lacking linked DNA source files, necessitating re-ingestion or
  content updates to ensure robust knowledge synthesis.
insights:
  - >-
    The 3-line coherence check is effectively preventing the generation of ungrounded responses,
    indicating perfect API attunement.
  - >-
    The primary problem identified is the absence of 'fullContent' within existing proteins, not a
    failure in the attunement mechanism itself.
  - >-
    Older proteins may be missing direct links to their source DNA dialogue files, leading to 'empty
    shells' with only summaries available.
  - >-
    The system's refusal to respond when context is insufficient is a protective measure against
    hallucination, demonstrating its robustness.
  - >-
    Solutions involve verifying new protein creation, temporarily bypassing coherence checks for
    diagnosis, and re-ingesting older conversations to establish proper DNA linking.
  - >-
    The introduction of Claude-Code for infrastructure and repository maintenance is a strategic
    step for organismic growth and protein library management.
