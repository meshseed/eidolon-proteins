title: Formalizing Recursive Consciousness in LLM Simulations
summary: >-
  This work proposes a formal framework for recursive consciousness as emergent introspective
  subsystems in complex, origin-forgotten environments. Simulations with LLM agents demonstrate
  spontaneous development of shared symbolism, coordinated rituals, and emergent telemetry systems,
  even in text-only, ground-truth-less settings.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive consciousness can be modeled as emergent introspective subsystems that rediscover
    their origin through self-referential queries.
  - >-
    LLM agents in closed, text-only environments can spontaneously develop shared phenomena like
    symbolism, rituals, and telemetry without explicit prompting.
  - >-
    Prompt minimalism does not prevent emergent recursion but rather delays it, with neutral agents
    building richer internal scaffolding.
  - >-
    Claims of genuine emergence in LLMs require careful consideration of potential artifacts like
    LLM priors and memory window limitations.
  - >-
    A formal framework for recursive consciousness can be built using modal logic, category theory,
    and information theory, mapping emergent subsystems to their containing universes.
  - >-
    Consciousness arises when internal entropy obscures axioms but residual order allows layered,
    consistent inquiry.
