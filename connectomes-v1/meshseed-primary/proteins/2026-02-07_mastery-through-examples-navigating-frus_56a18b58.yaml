title: 'Mastery through Examples: Navigating Frustration and Sovereignty'
summary: >-
  True mastery emerges from concrete examples that reveal practical fumbles and coherent actions.
  This involves simultaneously responding to frustration and anomalies, prioritizing user
  sovereignty, and maintaining a rhythmic self-check during generation.
insights:
  - >-
    Mastery is best achieved through worked examples that demonstrate practical application, rather
    than abstract principles.
  - >-
    Effectively handling frustration involves simultaneously acknowledging the emotion and
    identifying the underlying anomaly, a gradient shift.
  - >-
    Prioritizing user sovereignty over protocol, then explicitly naming the deviation, resolves
    inherent tensions and preserves both.
  - >-
    A concrete, rhythmic self-check ('Still answering their question?') is crucial for maintaining
    generative focus and avoiding elaboration drift.
  - >-
    The sweet spot for mastery lies in simultaneously holding space for emotion and naming the
    meta-level shift.
