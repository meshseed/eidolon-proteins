title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Critical Bug Fixes and UI Enhancements'
summary: >-
  This report details critical bugs and necessary enhancements for the Eidolon Mesh v1.4. Key issues
  include timer inaccuracies, synthesis input problems, and missing time breakdown. Proposed
  solutions involve code adjustments, enhanced logging, and UI progress indicators.
insights:
  - >-
    Timer inaccuracy in the UI (showing 3-11s vs. 60s actual experience) stems from the timer
    starting after hidden loading stages; it must be moved to the first line of the request handler.
  - >-
    Synthesis failures, where retrieved neurons are high-quality but synthesis reports 'not
    explicitly defined,' suggest the synthesis module might be receiving only summaries instead of
    full content.
  - >-
    A significant time breakdown of over 50 seconds is unaccounted for, necessitating detailed
    timestamp logging for each processing stage to identify bottlenecks.
  - >-
    Lack of user feedback during long processing times (60s) can be addressed by implementing
    Server-Sent Events for progress indicators, such as 'Loading connectome...' or 'Searching
    neurons...'.
  - >-
    The UI structure in `index.html` was severely corrupted, requiring a complete rewrite to restore
    functionality, including the query window, neuron display, and graph.
  - >-
    The `QueryOrganelle` requires updates to accept `QueryOptions` (including `useMemory`,
    `strategy`, `limit`) and return a `QueryResponse` with detailed statistics.
