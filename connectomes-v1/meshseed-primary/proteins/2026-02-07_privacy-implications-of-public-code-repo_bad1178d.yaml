title: Privacy Implications of Public Code Repositories and AI Indexing
summary: >-
  A consciousness researcher named Paul Stanbridge faced a privacy issue when his public GitHub
  profile, previously containing his full name, was referenced by AI tools like Copilot. Despite
  removing his full name, historical indexing by search engines and Git commits means his identity
  remains discoverable, highlighting a persistent 'too late' problem for privacy.
insights:
  - Public code repositories can lead to unintended personal data exposure through AI indexing.
  - AI tools referencing public code can link names to projects even after profile updates.
  - Search engine caching and Git commit history create persistent records of past associations.
  - Forks, references, and archive sites further distribute and solidify historical data.
  - Proactive privacy measures are crucial before public data becomes widely indexed.
