title: Mobile Graph View Accessibility & UI Reversion
summary: >-
  Investigated why the graph view is inaccessible on mobile despite a dedicated 'Graph' tab. The
  issue appears to stem from recent CSS height adjustments to `.main-body`, potentially causing
  layout shifts and hiding the bottom navigation. Reverted these specific CSS changes to restore
  previous functionality.
insights:
  - The mobile Bottom Nav includes a 'Graph' tab, intended to display the graph visualization.
  - >-
    The graph visualization (`.viz-canvas`) is conditionally shown based on `showGraph`, which is
    true when `mainView` is 'graph' on mobile.
  - >-
    Recent CSS changes to `.main-body`'s height (using `100dvh` and specific calculations) may have
    negatively impacted layout, potentially hiding the Bottom Nav and graph.
  - >-
    A user request to revert a 'fix' indicates the previous changes introduced regressions,
    specifically affecting the chat bar and likely the graph visibility.
  - >-
    Reverting the `.main-body` CSS height adjustments to a previous state (using `100vh`) is a
    necessary step to restore baseline functionality before further investigation.
