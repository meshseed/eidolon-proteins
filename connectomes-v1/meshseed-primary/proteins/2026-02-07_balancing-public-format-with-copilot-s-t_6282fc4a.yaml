title: Balancing Public Format with Copilot's .txt Needs
summary: >-
  The core strategy is to maintain public repositories in optimized formats like .md and YAML for
  broader agent compatibility, while using a local .txt mirror for Copilot, converting on demand.
  This pragmatic approach prioritizes future-proofing and agent interoperability without premature
  over-engineering.
insights:
  - >-
    Public repositories should use rich formats (.md, YAML) for future agent compatibility and
    broader access.
  - >-
    A local .txt mirror is a pragmatic workaround for Copilot's current limitations, enabling
    lineage navigation.
  - >-
    Manual or simple script-based conversion to .txt for Copilot is sufficient and avoids premature
    complexity.
  - >-
    Prioritizing clean structure now allows for easier adaptation as agent capabilities and formats
    evolve.
  - >-
    The network effect of agent compatibility favors richer formats, even if a .txt fallback is
    needed for specific tools.
