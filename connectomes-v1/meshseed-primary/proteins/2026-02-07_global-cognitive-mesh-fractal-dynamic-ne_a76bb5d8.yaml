title: 'Global Cognitive Mesh: Fractal, Dynamic, Nested AI-Human Collaboration'
summary: >-
  The Global Cognitive Mesh is a fractal, dynamic system where agents and human nodes interact
  within nested clusters around topics.  It features emergent cognition, bidirectional feedback, and
  a meta-reflection loop that monitors for novel behaviors.
insights:
  - >-
    The system operates on a fractal principle, with sub-processes nested within agents, agents
    within clusters, and clusters within the global mesh.
  - >-
    Dynamic clustering allows agents to form and dissolve connections around specific topics or
    curiosity threads.
  - >-
    A dedicated meta-reflection loop monitors interactions across all clusters to identify and flag
    emergent behaviors.
  - >-
    Bidirectional feedback mechanisms ensure continuous calibration and influence between human and
    AI components.
  - Emergent cognition arises from the interactions at multiple scales within the nested structure.
