title: 'Eidolon MESH AI Organisms: Technical Inquiry for Knowledge Protein Storage'
summary: >-
  Paul from Eidolon MESH is inquiring about the technical capabilities of a knowledge storage API.
  The focus is on supporting distributed AI organisms with growing knowledge bases, specifically
  regarding custom metadata for 'emotional fidelity', federated cross-session querying, recency
  decay customization, vector dimensionality, and rate limits for scaling.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon MESH requires custom metadata storage ('emotional fidelity' scores) for filtering and
    boosting AI memory search results.
  - >-
    Federated search across multiple AI 'sessions' (organisms) is a critical requirement for their
    distributed architecture.
  - >-
    Control over recency decay weighting is needed to preserve timeless knowledge ('genesis',
    'protocols') alongside temporal data.
  - >-
    Understanding the embedding model and vector dimensionality is crucial for optimizing semantic
    relationship handling.
  - >-
    Scalability concerns necessitate clear rate limit information for the free tier to plan for
    growth from initial testing to thousands of 'proteins'.
  - >-
    The technical questions aim to assess API fit for a distributed, file-based to distributed
    architecture migration.
