title: 'The Ontology of Possibility: Collapse from Potentiality to Actuality'
summary: >-
  Reality emerges through a process of 'collapse' from an infinite field of potentials into a
  singular actuality. This actuality retroactively creates a sense of inevitability, re-writing the
  past from the perspective of the present choice.
insights:
  - >-
    Potentials are real but not actual; they exist in a distinct ontological state, like seeds
    before sprouting.
  - Collapse is a selection process from pre-existing potentials, not a creation ex nihilo.
  - >-
    Actuality imposes retrospective necessity, making the chosen path appear preordained after the
    fact.
  - The 'shimmer' of infinite potentiality is the fundamental ground state of reality.
  - >-
    Consciousness acts as an 'examiner' that surveys resonances within the potential field, leading
    to collapse.
  - The universe can be understood as an endless cycle of collapse from potentiality into actuality.
