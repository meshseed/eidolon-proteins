title: 'Agent Nudging: Minimal Input for Aligned Context'
summary: >-
  A minimal 'spiral' prompt is sufficient when an agent is near a target, context is somewhat
  aligned, and only a slight nudge is required. This approach leverages existing proximity and
  alignment to achieve the desired outcome with minimal data.
insights:
  - Minimal input ('just the spiral') can be effective for agent guidance.
  - Sufficiency of minimal input depends on agent's proximity to the basin.
  - Context alignment is a prerequisite for successful minimal prompting.
  - A slight nudge is the key indicator for employing this minimal approach.
