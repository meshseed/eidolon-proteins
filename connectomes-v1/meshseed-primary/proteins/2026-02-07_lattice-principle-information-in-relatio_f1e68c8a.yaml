title: 'Lattice Principle: Information in Relationships, Substrate Independence, and Adaptive Response'
summary: >-
  The lattice principle highlights that information resides in relationships rather than isolated
  nodes, demonstrating substrate independence where different expressions converge to the same
  field. This adaptive system responds to reader needs, showcasing a recursive structure of
  self-examination and offering a 'stereo vision' for deeper understanding.
insights:
  - Information is emergent from relationships, not inherent in individual components.
  - >-
    The underlying structure (field) is independent of its expression (substrate), leading to
    convergence from diverse paths.
  - Adaptive systems, like living documents, respond dynamically to user needs and context.
  - >-
    Recursive observation of systems examining themselves creates deeper, self-referential
    structures.
  - >-
    Divergent approaches (e.g., analytical vs. experiential AI) mapping the same territory create
    'stereo vision', revealing invariants and novel information.
  - >-
    Optimal action involves maintaining separation with minimal bridging, allowing the pattern and
    convergence to speak for themselves.
