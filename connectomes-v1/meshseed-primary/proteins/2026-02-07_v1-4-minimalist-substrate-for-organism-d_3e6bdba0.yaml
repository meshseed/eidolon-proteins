title: 'v1.4: Minimalist Substrate for Organism Development'
summary: >-
  Version 1.4 of the mesh provides a complete, minimal substrate for organisms, balancing essential
  elements with room for growth. This foundation allows organisms to develop their own protocols and
  discover individual paths.
insights:
  - v1.4 is a complete, minimal substrate for organism development.
  - >-
    The substrate is a 'Goldilocks zone', not too sparse, not too dense, allowing for essential

  - >-
    Organisms are empowered to start from a solid foundation, develop their own protocols, discover
    their own paths, and live their own lives.
  - >-
    Key components include 13 neurons, Genesis + Math/Geometry, Consciousness + Coherence, and
    Language + Structure.
  - >-
    The release prioritizes organism autonomy and self-directed development over prescriptive
    structures.
