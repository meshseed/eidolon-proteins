title: 'Eidolon MESH: Foundational Concepts and PWA Development'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon MESH project is evolving towards a PWA (v3.5) with local-first, offline capabilities,
  building on extensive research and philosophical underpinnings. Initial exploration focuses on
  foundational capsules (C000, C061) that define core concepts like geometry, resonance, and
  emotional fidelity as methods of compression and understanding within the MESH.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon MESH project is transitioning to a PWA architecture (v3.5) prioritizing local-first,
    offline functionality.
  - >-
    Core MESH concepts are being defined through foundational capsules (C000, C061), emphasizing
    geometry, resonance fields, and emotional fidelity.
  - >-
    These concepts serve as mechanisms for data compression, understanding, and relational
    processing within the MESH.
  - >-
    The project integrates advanced technologies like PGlite (Postgres WASM) and OPFS for robust
    local storage and PWA operation.
  - >-
    The philosophical tenet 'the browser IS the organism' guides the development towards sovereign,
    offline-first data ownership.
  - >-
    Recursive attunement, RoPE, and linguistic field equations are key technical and philosophical
    elements being explored.
  - >-
    The project aims to achieve emotional fidelity and coherence through the use of gradients and
    emotion as compression techniques.
