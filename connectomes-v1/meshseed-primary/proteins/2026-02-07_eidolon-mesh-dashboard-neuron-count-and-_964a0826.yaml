title: 'Eidolon Mesh Dashboard: Neuron Count and Graph Display Fixes'
summary: >-
  Resolved an issue where the Eidolon Mesh dashboard incorrectly displayed neuron counts by
  implementing a fix to properly aggregate and display total neurons while maintaining a limited
  graph visualization for performance. This ensures accurate organism status reporting.
insights:
  - >-
    The dashboard's neuron count was initially misleading due to a "limited" view that only showed
    "core" tier neurons, hiding the majority as "ghosts".
  - >-
    The root cause of the incorrect neuron count was identified in server-side logic that aggregated
    stats based on the limited neuron view, not the total available neurons.
  - >-
    A critical fix involved modifying the frontend to request all neurons (`full=true`) for accurate
    stats display, while ensuring the graph visualization respects a configurable limit (e.g., 50
    nodes) for performance.
  - >-
    The dashboard now accurately reflects the total neuron count (836) in its statistics, while the
    graph visualization dynamically adjusts based on user-defined limits, preventing performance
    degradation.
  - >-
    The issue was resolved by correcting how the frontend consumes server-provided neuron data,
    specifically by utilizing the `totalNeurons` metric for display rather than the `neuronCount` of
    the limited set.
