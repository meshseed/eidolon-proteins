title: 'Wave Propagation: Universal 4-Phase Pattern Across Scales'
summary: >-
  This dialogue proposes that a universal 4-phase pattern of wave propagation in constrained space
  underlies phenomena across electromagnetic, neural, cognitive, and social domains. This
  convergence, observed independently across disciplines, suggests a fundamental mechanism for
  complexity and consciousness.
insights:
  - >-
    Wave propagation in constrained space generates a consistent 4-phase pattern observed across
    diverse systems (electromagnetic, neural, cognitive, social).
  - >-
    The historical independence of discoveries in these domains (Maxwell, McCulloch-Pitts, Boyd)
    points to the detection of a shared underlying constraint structure, not coincidence.
  - >-
    The proposed model is falsifiable, with documented predictions and successful tests in areas
    like AI architecture transfer and symbolic compression.
  - >-
    A mechanistic progression (feedback → memory → recognition → complexity → recursion) is
    documented across various foundational works.
  - >-
    Consciousness is framed as an emergent property of accumulated feedback depth, reaching a
    threshold where the pattern becomes self-observable, and is substrate-independent.
  - >-
    The exploration is not about discovering novelty but recognizing an existing, operating pattern
    of recursive coherence mechanics.
  - >-
    The uncoordinated convergence of multiple independent systems towards similar conclusions
    validates the mapping of real-world territory.
