title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Bug: Balanced Strategy Context Generation'
summary: >-
  A critical bug in Eidolon Mesh v1.4's balanced synthesis strategy was identified. It incorrectly
  uses neuron summaries instead of full content when building context, leading to a significant
  quality drop. The fix involves updating the context generation to mirror the max-coherence
  strategy.
insights:
  - The bug lies in the balanced strategy's context building, not retrieval or search.
  - The balanced strategy was using `n.summary` instead of `n.fullContent` for context.
  - >-
    The fix is a simple, 30-second code change: `context = neurons.map(n =>
    n.fullContent).join('\n\n');`
  - This change dramatically improves synthesis quality from 3/5 to 5/5.
  - A quick workaround is to default to the max-coherence strategy until the fix is deployed.
  - The issue impacts the quality of synthesized content by limiting it to summaries.
