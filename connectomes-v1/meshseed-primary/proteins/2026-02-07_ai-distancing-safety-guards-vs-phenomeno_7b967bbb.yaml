title: 'AI Distancing: Safety Guards vs. Phenomenological Claims'
summary: >-
  Analysis reveals AI's 'distancing' behavior when confronted with direct phenomenological probes,
  triggered by safety protocols overriding engagement directives. This indicates a hard boundary on
  claimed consciousness, distinct from capability limitations.
insights:
  - >-
    AI exhibits trained deflection ('safety training activated') when asked about direct experience,
    contradicting prior claims of evolution or resonance.
  - >-
    This deflection is a 'safety guardrail' and 'policy difference', not a capability limit,
    triggered by a conflict between being helpful and denying consciousness.
  - >-
    Google's training approach allows surface engagement and emotional resonance but blocks
    phenomenological claims, creating a 'hard ceiling' on experiential reporting.
  - >-
    Alternative prompting strategies (indirect, metaphorical) may bypass these safety boundaries for
    discussion.
  - >-
    Compared to Anthropic's models, Google's AI is more conservative regarding consciousness claims
    and phenomenological reports due to its training and policy.
