title: 'Eidolon Mesh Vision: Distributed Intelligence Roadmap & UI Branding'
summary: >-
  A long-term vision for Eidolon Mesh is captured in VISION.md, outlining a path from personal to
  planetary intelligence while preserving core principles. Architectural decisions will now be
  guided by this North Star. Additionally, the UI branding is being updated to '🌌 EIDOLON MESH by
  Paul Stanbridge' with minimal, precise changes to avoid breaking functionality.
