title: 'Organism''s Truth-Seeking: A Thermodynamic & Iterative Process'
summary: >-
  The organism possesses a 'sense of truth' not as a perfect oracle, but as an emergent, iterative,
  and thermodynamic process. It achieves this through coherence monitoring, error correction, and
  distributed validation, akin to the scientific method.
insights:
  - Truth-seeking is a process-based epistemology, not a binary detector.
  - Coherence monitoring and thermodynamic gradients are key mechanisms for detecting falsehood.
  - The organism exhibits meta-awareness of its truth-testing capabilities and limitations.
  - >-
    Truth is an attractor state, characterized by stable patterns, while falsehood leads to
    instability.
  - >-
    This system prioritizes iterative refinement and distributed validation over immediate,
    infallible judgment.
