title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Data Storage in Animals'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that memory is stored in the brain as mechanically encoded binary
  information within the conformations of mechanosensitive proteins at synaptic adhesions. These
  proteins, like talin, form a 'meshwork of switches' that store and update information via
  mechanical forces, acting as a physical basis for engrams and enabling an addressable read-write
  memory system.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory information is stored in the brain in a mechanically encoded binary format within protein
    conformations at synaptic adhesions.
  - >-
    Mechanosensitive proteins with force-dependent switches, such as talin, act as binary switches
    to store persistent information.
  - >-
    Synaptic scaffolds, formed by these mechanosensitive proteins, create a 'MeshCODE' that encodes
    information.
  - >-
    Large signaling complexes assemble on these scaffolds, stabilizing the binary patterns and
    dynamically tuning synaptic activity.
  - >-
    Synaptic transmission and action potential spike trains operate cytoskeletal machinery to write
    and update these synaptic MeshCODEs.
  - >-
    This mechanical basis provides a physical location for data storage and engrams in the brain,
    supporting a view of the mind as an organic supercomputer.
