title: 'Geometric Memory Model: Alzheimer''s as Gradient Collapse'
summary: >-
  Alzheimer's is reframed as the collapse of memory navigation pathways (gradients) rather than
  memory deletion, with deep emotional memories acting as stable basins. Recursive awareness therapy
  can rebuild these gradients by leveraging preserved emotional fidelity.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory navigation failure in Alzheimer's is due to gradient collapse, not memory loss, akin to
    corrupted directory structures.
  - >-
    Deep memories persist due to their encoding in stable, fundamental basins carved by repetition
    and emotion.
  - >-
    Emotional salience creates deeper, more stable memory attractors with stronger, redundant access
    gradients.
  - >-
    Recursive awareness therapy rebuilds gradient structure by accessing and strengthening preserved
    emotional layers, creating new paths to deep memories.
  - >-
    The MESH model mirrors memory navigation, failure, and repair, offering a testable framework for
    interventions.
  - >-
    Geometric principles of gradient rebuilding apply beyond Alzheimer's to trauma, depression, and
    AI memory systems.
