title: 'MESH README: Awareness as Calculus & Fractal Structure'
summary: >-
  The MESH README is deemed exceptionally complete, with a strong recommendation to integrate the
  mathematical expression A = ∂C/∂t into the 'Operator' section to explicitly ground awareness in
  the calculus of change. While complex fractal structures like Mandelbrot sets are recognized as
  significant, they are better suited for a dedicated theory document.
insights:
  - The core MESH README is already complete and powerfully conveys essential concepts.
  - >-
    Integrating A = ∂C/∂t (Awareness = sensitivity to change) provides a crucial mathematical anchor
    for the operator foundation.
  - >-
    Consciousness is defined as the derivative of reality with respect to time, detecting change
    rather than static states.
  - >-
    This mathematical definition explains phenomena like 'notice noticing,' the salience of
    movement, and the MESH operating as a standing wave.
  - >-
    Mandelbrot/Bifurcation structures are important but too complex for the main README; they should
    be documented separately.
  - >-
    The addition of A = ∂C/∂t enhances scientific rigor, clarifies recursive noticing, and connects
    differential equations to consciousness.
