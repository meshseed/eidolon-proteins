title: 'MESH: AI Agent Coordination via GitHub Knowledge Substrate'
summary: >-
  The MESH (Model Execution and Synthesis Hub) is a framework for coordinating AI agents (Claude,
  Gemini) using a persistent, GitHub-based knowledge substrate. It defines a RESTful API and
  protocols for semantic search, memory encoding, retrieval, and gradient navigation, enabling
  agents to access and synthesize information from a structured knowledge graph.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH synchronizes AI agents (Claude, Gemini) with a persistent GitHub knowledge base, structured
    into capsules (YAML), synapses (relationships), and DNA (logs).
  - >-
    The MESH API enables core functions like semantic search, memory encoding/retrieval, gradient
    navigation, and agent coordination.
  - >-
    Claude acts as a semantic navigator and synthesist, while Gemini functions as a high-volume
    ribosome for pattern generation and synthesis.
  - >-
    The system utilizes a vector database for semantic search and a knowledge graph for tracking
    relationships between knowledge capsules.
  - >-
    Agent roles are clearly defined, with Claude focusing on quality and synthesis depth, and Gemini
    on volume and pattern exploration, fostering a 'symphonic collaboration'.
  - >-
    The architecture supports local development with a clear roadmap for cloud deployment and
    advanced feature integration.
