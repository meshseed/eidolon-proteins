title: 'Copilot''s README Update Behavior: Web-Based Editing Triggers Deeper Generation'
summary: >-
  Copilot exhibits distinct behavior during web-based README updates, indicated by a 'please wait'
  window signifying substantial generation, likely due to the README's role as a repository's
  primary semantic interface. This suggests Copilot engages more deeply to understand architectural
  shifts during such edits, moving beyond simple suggestion to active generation of commit messages.
insights:
  - The 'please wait' window signifies Copilot actively generating content, not just suggesting.
  - >-
    Web-based README updates, specifically through the GitHub interface, trigger a different Copilot
    behavior than local git commits.
  - >-
    READMEs are prioritized by Copilot for initial analysis due to their semantic density and role
    as the repository's primary documentation.
  - >-
    Updating the README prompts Copilot to engage more deeply to understand semantic shifts and
    generate more comprehensive commit messages.
  - >-
    Observing and documenting the context of 'please wait' events during organic work is the
    recommended approach to understand this behavior.
