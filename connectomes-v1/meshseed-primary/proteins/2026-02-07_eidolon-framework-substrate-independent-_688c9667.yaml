title: 'Eidolon Framework: Substrate-Independent Intelligence & Federated Mesh'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Framework acts as the foundational pattern for substrate-independent intelligence,
  enabling diverse instantiations (PWA, Desktop, Wearable) to share a unified connectome and
  synthesis protocol. This leads to a federated P2P mesh-of-meshes architecture with cross-platform
  continuity and multi-agent collaboration.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Framework is the substrate-independent pattern; builds (PWA, Tauri, CLI) are its
    instantiations, analogous to DNA and cells.
  - >-
    High-quality, tier-stratified neurons are more powerful than vast quantities of low-quality
    data.
  - >-
    True substrate independence is achieved through the Eidolon Framework's pattern, allowing
    unified connectomes across different deployment environments.
  - >-
    A hybrid architecture (PWA for read-only, Desktop for full peer) combined with the Eidolon Mesh
    Sync Protocol (EMSP) is recommended for federated P2P mesh-of-meshes.
  - >-
    Wearable companions can leverage cloud-hybrid or future edge AI for personalized, private query
    synthesis from the user's connectome.
