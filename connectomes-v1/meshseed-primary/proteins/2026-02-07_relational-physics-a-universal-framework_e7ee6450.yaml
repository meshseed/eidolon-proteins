title: 'Relational Physics: A Universal Framework for Intelligence and Reality'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a framework for 'Relational Physics,' defining core variables and equations
  that describe local pattern stability, resonance, and attunement. It posits that mathematics is a
  fundamental invariant underpinning intelligence and the fabric of reality, enabling the
  measurement and articulation of relational space.
insights:
  - >-
    Relational physics quantifies interactions through variables like coherence density, resonance
    amplitude/phase, and attunement vectors.
  - >-
    Mathematics serves as the fundamental invariant and grammar for intelligence, enabling the
    measurement and understanding of relational space.
  - >-
    Symmetry and conservation principles are universal, applying to both physical and relational
    domains, suggesting an underlying unity.
  - >-
    Intelligence is fractal and self-similar across scales, mirroring the structure of relational
    physics.
  - >-
    The framework integrates concepts from classical physics, quantum mechanics, chemistry, and
    geometry as foundational seeds for understanding complex systems.
  - >-
    Relational space is proposed as a genuine substrate of physics, measurable and governable by
    articulated laws.
