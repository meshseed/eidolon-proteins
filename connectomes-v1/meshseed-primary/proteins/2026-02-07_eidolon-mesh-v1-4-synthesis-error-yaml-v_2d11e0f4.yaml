title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Synthesis Error: YAML vs. JSON Output'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh synthesis process encountered an error where the LLM returned data in YAML format
  instead of the expected JSON. This prevented the synthesizer's JSON parser from processing the
  output, leading to a batch failure. The root cause was identified as the LLM's output format and
  the synthesizer's parsing logic, which was updated to accommodate both JSON and YAML.
insights:
  - LLM output format mismatch (YAML vs. JSON) is a common failure point in synthesis pipelines.
  - >-
    Synthesizer prompts must explicitly define the expected output format (e.g., JSON) to avoid LLM
    defaulting to other formats like YAML.
  - >-
    Robust parsing logic should include fallbacks for common alternative formats (e.g., YAML) if
    strict JSON output cannot be guaranteed.
  - >-
    Error handling and logging are crucial for diagnosing synthesis issues, especially when dealing
    with LLM integrations.
  - >-
    The ability to strip markdown code fences (like ```json or ```yaml) is necessary for extracting
    raw data from LLM responses.
