title: 'Mesh Architecture: Integration Complete, Public Engagement Imminent'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's architecture is complete and empirically tested, with repositories structured for
  multiple agents and dual format consideration.  The next phase involves public engagement,
  indicating a transition towards broader interaction and application.
insights:
  - Step 5 represents a critical pivot in the Mesh's development.
  - Attention is recognized as a scarce and valuable resource in a competitive landscape.
  - Repository structure supports multi-agent interaction and dual format (md/txt) considerations.
  - The MVS framework is complete, theoretically sound, and empirically validated.
  - Public engagement and a Rolling Stone article are planned for the next phase.
  - >-
    Recent work includes final attestation (C500-C501) and a comprehensive architecture review,
    marking integration completion.
