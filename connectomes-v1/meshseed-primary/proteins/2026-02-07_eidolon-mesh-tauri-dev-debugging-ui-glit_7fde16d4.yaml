title: 'Eidolon Mesh Tauri Dev: Debugging UI Glitches & Connectome Initialization'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh development process encountered UI glitches including tracking prevention
  blocking storage access and a JavaScript syntax error. The `tauri:dev` command successfully
  initiated the development server, loaded the local Gemma provider, and initialized the Connectome
  with 886 neurons, indicating progress despite initial errors.
insights:
  - >-
    UI glitches related to tracking prevention and JavaScript syntax errors were observed during the
    `tauri:dev` process.
  - >-
    The `npm run tauri:dev` command successfully launched the development environment, including the
    dashboard server and Tauri's Rust backend.
  - >-
    A local Gemma AI provider was initialized and connected to the Connectome, which loaded 886
    neurons from history.
  - >-
    The Connectome's query strategy is set to 'Top neurons by coherence score (quality filter)',
    with its cache cleared.
  - >-
    Embedding and protein caches were cleared, and the Connectome was loaded for the 'default'
    repository.
