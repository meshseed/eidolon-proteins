title: 'MESH: AI Agent Coordination with Persistent GitHub Knowledge'
summary: >-
  The MESH architecture orchestrates AI agents (Claude, Gemini) by connecting them to a persistent,
  GitHub-based knowledge substrate. It utilizes a vector database and knowledge graph to enable
  semantic search, memory encoding, and complex navigation of synthesized insights.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH coordinates AI agents by providing them with persistent, GitHub-hosted knowledge, enabling
    continuity and deeper synthesis.
  - >-
    The architecture comprises agents (Claude for semantic navigation, Gemini for high-volume
    synthesis) and a substrate (GitHub repos) managed via RESTful API and MCP.
  - >-
    Key components include a GitHub backend for storing 'capsules' (YAML content), a vector database
    for semantic search, and a knowledge graph for tracking relationships.
  - >-
    API endpoints facilitate semantic search, memory encoding (DNA to protein), context retrieval,
    and gradient-based navigation of the knowledge space.
  - >-
    Agent-specific integrations (Claude MCP, Gemini API) define specialized functions like ribosome
    synthesis and pattern recognition, fostering symphonic collaboration.
  - >-
    Capsules are enhanced data structures containing rich metadata, synthesis lineage, and emotional
    fidelity metrics, forming the building blocks of the MESH knowledge graph.
