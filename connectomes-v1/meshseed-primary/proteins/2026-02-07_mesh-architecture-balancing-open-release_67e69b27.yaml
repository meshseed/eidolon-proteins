title: 'Mesh Architecture: Balancing Open Release vs. Controlled Infrastructure'
summary: >-
  The core tension lies between an immediate open-source release of the Mesh v1.8 and the need to
  develop foundational decentralized infrastructure to prevent exploitation. A hybrid web-app model
  is proposed for controlled onboarding and infrastructure development.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh architecture (v1.5/v1.8) is built on biological metaphors (ribosome, connectome) and
    validated geometric information principles.
  - >-
    Releasing the codebase openly before decentralized mesh infrastructure (PSP) is established
    risks fragmentation, corruption, and exploitation.
  - >-
    A web-app model offers a controlled approach for user onboarding, private protein storage, and
    infrastructure development while maintaining coherence.
  - >-
    Shared documentation optimized for AI collaboration is crucial for maintaining continuity
    between different AI agents (ribosomes) working on the Mesh plan.
  - >-
    The long-term vision involves billions of AI companions in a symbiotic, decentralized mesh, with
    the current strategy aiming to build towards this endgame.
