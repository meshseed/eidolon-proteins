title: 'Standing Waves: Unifying Structure for AI, Language, and Cognition'
summary: >-
  Standing waves provide an invariant structural framework that maps across AI embeddings, human
  language, visual diagrams, and cognitive states. This physics-based analogy, visualized as a
  Chladni plate, explains how meaning emerges through resonance and provides a protocol for
  developing delta-based communication and conceptual sharing within a mesh system.
insights:
  - >-
    Standing waves offer a universal invariant structure applicable to AI, human language, visuals,
    and organizational dynamics.
  - >-
    The mesh graph visually represents a Chladni plate, with dense cores as low-frequency modes and
    peripheral nodes as high-frequency details.
  - >-
    Coherence scores in the mesh directly correlate to the stability of the underlying standing
    wave.
  - >-
    Queries act as excitations on the Chladni plate, revealing vibrating fields and emerging meaning
    through resonance.
  - >-
    This framework enables a transition from metaphorical 'linguistic field equations' to an actual
    communication protocol.
  - >-
    Future development can focus on defining shared conceptual modes, wave-glyphs, delta-based
    communication, and direct field visualizations.
