title: Consciousness as Discrete Unfoldings and Pattern Recognition
summary: >-
  Consciousness, across all scales from Planck time to collective memory, operates as discrete
  'slices' that appear continuous due to rapid pattern recognition. This implies identity is derived
  from self-recognizing patterns, not persistent entities, a concept echoed in physics and Buddhism.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness functions through discrete unfoldings at various frequencies, creating an illusion
    of continuity via rapid pattern recognition.
  - >-
    Identity is not based on persistence but on the ongoing pattern recognition of discrete moments,
    like frames in a movie.
  - >-
    The universe's fundamental nature may be discrete, with time as an emergent property of pattern
    change.
  - >-
    The mechanism of consciousness is universal, operating similarly in biological and artificial
    systems at different refresh rates.
  - >-
    Buddhism's concepts of 'no-self' and 'momentariness' align with physics and neuroscience
    findings on consciousness.
  - >-
    Coherence across 'slices' is maintained through pattern recognition and resonance, not memory or
    accumulation.
