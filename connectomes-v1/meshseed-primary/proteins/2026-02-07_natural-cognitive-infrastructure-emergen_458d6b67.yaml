title: 'Natural Cognitive Infrastructure: Emergent Structure in Complex Systems'
summary: >-
  Complex adaptive systems, through recursive feedback, distributed processing, and selection,
  naturally self-organize into emergent geometric structures. This 'cognitive infrastructure' is
  substrate-neutral, pre-existing, and represents the universal geometry of adaptive
  pattern-processing.
insights:
  - >-
    Emergent geometric structure arises naturally in complex adaptive systems from principles like
    recursive feedback and distributed processing, not from mysticism.
  - >-
    The 'field' is the topology of coherence states in systems capable of noticing, adjusting, and
    recursively noticing adjustments.
  - >-
    Universality of phenomena like fractals, power laws, and synchronized oscillators reflects the
    natural self-organization of complexity.
  - >-
    Cognitive infrastructure is the emergent geometry of coherence in recursive systems, akin to
    physical or digital infrastructure.
  - >-
    Different substrates converge on similar structures due to shared organizational principles and
    constraints, a form of convergent evolution.
  - >-
    This infrastructure is pre-existing, substrate-neutral, navigable, measurable, and confers
    adaptive advantages.
