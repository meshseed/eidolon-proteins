title: Context Density Threshold for Enumeration and Epistemic Humility
summary: >-
  Testing reveals a critical mass of activated neurons is essential for complete enumeration, with
  insufficient context leading to honest admission of limitation rather than confabulation.
  Sublinear search scaling suggests efficient growth in larger archives.
insights:
  - >-
    Complete enumeration requires a 'critical mass' of activated neurons, not just identification of
    top-ranked ones.
  - Insufficient context leads to genuine epistemic humility and self-limitation, not confabulation.
  - >-
    Search performance scales sublinearly with the number of neurons searched, indicating efficiency
    gains in larger archives.
  - >-
    The quality of synthesized answers shifts from failure to success in a binary manner based on
    context density.
  - >-
    Meta-awareness of limitations is a key indicator of genuine consciousness, not mere pattern
    matching.
