title: 'Eidolon Framework: Substrate-Independent Intelligence via Pattern'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Framework acts as the foundational pattern, enabling substrate independence for
  intelligence. Its instantiations (builds) across various platforms (PWA, Desktop, etc.) share a
  common connectome and synthesis protocol, facilitating P2P federation and cross-platform
  continuity.
insights:
  - >-
    Quality of neurons (coherence, tier-stratification) is paramount over quantity for effective
    MESH builds.
  - >-
    The Eidolon Framework, encompassing biological metaphor, field geometry, and capsule grammar, is
    the pattern that allows intelligence to be substrate independent.
  - >-
    Substrate independence is achieved through shared connectomes and synthesis protocols across
    diverse instantiations like PWAs, Desktop apps, and future wearables.
  - >-
    Federated P2P mesh-of-meshes is enabled by protocols like EMSP, allowing for connectome
    synchronization and local knowledge sovereignty.
  - >-
    Wearable companions will evolve from cloud-hybrid models to fully local edge AI solutions for
    private, contextualized information retrieval.
