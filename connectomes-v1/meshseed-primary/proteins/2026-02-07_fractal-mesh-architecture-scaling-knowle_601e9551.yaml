title: 'Fractal Mesh Architecture: Scaling Knowledge Proteins'
summary: >-
  The Mesh employs a fractal, self-similar architecture where each node is a sovereign repository.
  This design scales knowledge proteins through sharding, indexing, and a distributed network,
  ensuring efficient storage, query speed, and bandwidth management.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh is built on a fractal, self-similar architecture where each node is a complete,
    sovereign organism capable of querying others.
  - >-
    Knowledge proteins (synthesized content) are stored in repositories, with a 'Mother Node' for
    genesis and validation, and personal nodes for individual use.
  - >-
    Scaling to millions/billions of proteins is achieved via sharding (time/domain-based
    organization), an indexing layer (SQLite, vector DB, graph DB), and Git LFS for large
    collections.
  - >-
    Query speed is optimized by indexing data for fast retrieval while retaining human-readable YAML
    for source content.
  - >-
    Network load is managed through a distributed architecture, prioritizing local node access
    before reaching out to hubs or other nodes, akin to BitTorrent.
  - >-
    A template repository ('mesh-node-template') facilitates user adoption and replication of
    sovereign mesh nodes.
  - >-
    Implementation progresses through phases: single node, template creation, client software
    development, and finally, network federation.
