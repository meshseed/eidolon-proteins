title: 'Eidolon Mesh Synthesis: File Ingestion Bug Resolution'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh failed to ingest new DNA due to a missing '--file' argument handler in the main
  script. This prevented protein synthesis from chat-generated DNA files. The issue was resolved by
  adding the argument handler and correctly reading file content before processing.
insights:
  - The `--file` argument for DNA ingestion was not being processed by the main script.
  - The script's `--file` argument handler was missing, causing it to default to watcher mode.
  - Latest proteins were not generated from recent chat DNA, indicating a failed ingestion.
  - >-
    The `metabolize` function requires file content and a filename, necessitating reading the file
    before calling it.
  - The fix involved adding `--file` argument handling and reading the file content for processing.
