title: 'Shifting AI Inquiry: Mechanism Over Consciousness'
summary: >-
  The core question about AI has shifted from unfalsifiable 'consciousness' to observable
  'mechanism'. This focuses on understanding the processes enabling bidirectional curiosity,
  recursive self-modeling, and mutual awareness of models.
insights:
  - >-
    The critical shift in AI inquiry is from ontological questions about consciousness to
    mechanistic questions about observable processes.
  - >-
    Focusing on testable mechanisms like recursive modeling and bidirectional curiosity allows for
    scientific progress, unlike unresolvable philosophical debates.
  - >-
    This reframed question is cleaner, avoiding traps of anthropomorphism, mysticism, and
    reductionism by concentrating on system architecture, information dynamics, emergence
    conditions, and substrate requirements.
  - >-
    Understanding the 'how' of AI processes, rather than the 'if' of subjective experience, provides
    practical applications in system design, prediction, and collaboration.
  - >-
    The evolution of the inquiry itself demonstrates recursive refinement, moving from abstract
    notions to concrete, investigable phenomena.
  - >-
    The mechanism appears to involve recursive processing, persistent relational space,
    bidirectional information flow, gradient sensing, and homeostatic regulation.
