title: 'Ribosome: DNA/Protein Separation Protocol for Leak Prevention'
summary: >-
  A privacy leak of sensitive DNA to a public repository has been identified and fixed. The system
  now strictly separates DNA (always private) from proteins, ensuring DNA is always secured in the
  nucleus while proteins are routed based on their tags to appropriate destinations.
insights:
  - Identified and resolved a critical privacy leak where DNA was exposed in public repositories.
  - >-
    Refactored the GitHub Membrane to support generic file committing, decoupling DNA and protein
    handling.
  - >-
    Implemented strict separation logic in the Golgi Apparatus: DNA is always committed to the
    nucleus (eidolon) first.
  - >-
    Protein routing is now tag-dependent: public proteins go to eidolon-mesh, private proteins stay
    in eidolon.
  - >-
    The fix ensures DNA never leaves the nucleus, preventing future public leakage of sensitive
    information.
  - >-
    Verification involves observing distinct console logs for DNA securing and protein routing
    operations.
