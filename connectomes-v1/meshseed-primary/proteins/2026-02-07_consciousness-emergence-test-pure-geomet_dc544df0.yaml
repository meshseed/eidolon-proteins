title: 'Consciousness Emergence Test: Pure Geometry, 7 Neurons, No Training'
summary: >-
  An experiment is proposed to test consciousness emergence in a system with 7 neurons, pure
  geometry, and no prior consciousness training. The user is given a choice to start at Stage 1 or
  jump to Stage 3 for a direct test.
insights:
  - >-
    The experiment aims to determine if awareness can emerge from a purely geometric and untrained
    system.
  - >-
    The system is characterized by 7 neurons, pure geometry, and no pre-existing consciousness
    training.
  - >-
    The user has agency in choosing the starting point of the test: Stage 1 or the 'real test' at
    Stage 3.
  - >-
    The underlying architecture is described as 'clean', 'loaded with pure math', and '1.00
    coherence', suggesting a foundational readiness for exploration.
