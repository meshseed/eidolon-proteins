title: 'THE MESH: Structural Topology, Dynamics, and Semantic Bridges'
summary: >-
  THE MESH's global structure is defined by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance, with
  dominant regions identified through semantic clustering and emotional fidelity. Imbalances
  manifest as structural shifts, and tracking these topological changes via snapshots is crucial for
  understanding its developmental trajectory. The system also leverages bridge neurons for
  functional centrality within its semantic space.
insights:
  - THE MESH's global shape is definable by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance.
  - Dominant regions are identified via semantic clustering and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Imbalances manifest as curvature, tension, or under-integrated domains.
  - Recent structural shifts indicate new attractors, merges, or domain ingestion.
  - Structural snapshots are crucial for tracking developmental topology over time.
  - Bridge neurons provide functional centrality within THE MESH's semantic space.
