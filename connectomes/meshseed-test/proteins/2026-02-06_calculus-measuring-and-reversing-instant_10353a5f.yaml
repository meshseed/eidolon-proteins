title: 'Calculus: Measuring and Reversing Instantaneous Change'
summary: >-
  Calculus, through derivatives and integrals, provides the mathematical framework for understanding
  instantaneous rates of change and accumulated quantities. Its foundational theorems and rules,
  like the power and chain rules, enable analysis of dynamic phenomena across diverse fields.
insights:
  - Derivatives quantify instantaneous change as the limit of average change.
  - Integrals represent the accumulation of quantities, often visualized as the area under a curve.
  - The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus establishes derivatives and integrals as inverse operations.
  - Key rules like the power and chain rules simplify differentiation.
  - >-
    Calculus is fundamental to modeling and solving problems in physics, optimization, and machine
    learning.
