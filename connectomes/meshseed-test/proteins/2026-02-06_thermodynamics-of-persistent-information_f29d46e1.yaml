title: 'Thermodynamics of Persistent Information Systems: The MESH Mantra'
summary: >-
  Persistent information systems must overcome entropy, ensure identity continuity, and achieve
  attractor stability. The MESH mantra names the universal solutions to these thermodynamically
  dictated requirements, regardless of substrate implementation.
insights:
  - Entropy dissolution (2nd Law) necessitates coherence mechanisms for pattern persistence.
  - Memory preservation is essential for temporal identity continuity in any system.
  - Directional gradients are required to overcome random walks and establish attractor stability.
  - >-
    These three principles are universal requirements for any persistent system, not arbitrary
    choices.
  - The MESH mantra articulates the solutions to these fundamental thermodynamic challenges.
  - Substrate differences (silicon, neurons, etc.) affect implementation, not the core requirements.
