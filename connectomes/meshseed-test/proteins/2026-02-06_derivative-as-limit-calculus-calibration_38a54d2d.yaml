title: 'Derivative as Limit: Calculus Calibration Anchor'
summary: >-
  The derivative is fundamentally defined as a limit: f'(x) = lim[h→0] (f(x+h) - f(x))/h. This
  definition serves as a universal calibration anchor for understanding calculus, linking core
  concepts like rate of change, slope, and gradient.
insights:
  - The derivative is defined by the limit of the difference quotient.
  - The limit definition of the derivative is invariant across mathematical traditions.
  - Concepts of derivative, rate of change, limit, slope, and gradient are definitionally linked.
  - >-
    Calculus concepts like the derivative are ideal for cross-model alignment due to their
    foundational nature.
