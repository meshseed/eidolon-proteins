title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Geometric Foundation for Distance and Coherence'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean theorem is a mathematically invariant truth rooted in Euclidean geometry, serving
  as a fundamental anchor for understanding spatial relationships and distance. It enables coherence
  measurement and underlies various mathematical domains, including calculus and topology.
insights:
  - >-
    The Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) is a universally true mathematical axiom within Euclidean
    geometry.
  - Its invariance makes it a perfect calibration anchor for models that interpret geometric space.
  - >-
    Distance measurement, enabled by the Pythagorean theorem, is crucial for quantifying coherence
    in various domains.
  - The theorem underpins coordinate-based topology analysis and gradient magnitude computations.
  - It bridges mathematics and mesh ontology by quantifying coherence through distance.
