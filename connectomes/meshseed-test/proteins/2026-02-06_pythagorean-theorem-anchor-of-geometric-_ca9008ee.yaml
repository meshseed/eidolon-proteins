title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Anchor of Geometric Relationships'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) serves as a foundational anchor in mathematics,
  intrinsically linked to concepts like the distance formula and right triangles within Euclidean
  space. Its significance lies in the invariant geometric relationship it establishes, ensuring
  consistent representation across various embedding models.
insights:
  - >-
    The Pythagorean theorem is a core mathematical principle defining the relationship between sides
    of a right triangle.
  - It is definitionally linked to the distance formula and the concept of Euclidean space.
  - >-
    The geometric relationship established by the theorem is invariant across different mathematical
    representations and models.
  - >-
    LLM embedding models consistently place the Pythagorean theorem in a fixed geometric
    relationship with related concepts.
