title: 'Prime Factorization: Unique Decomposition and Cross-Model Invariance'
summary: >-
  Every integer greater than 1 possesses a unique prime factorization, a fundamental principle
  underpinning mathematical concepts like divisibility and RSA encryption. This definitional
  relationship between prime numbers and factorization ensures consistent representation across
  different LLM embedding models.
insights:
  - >-
    The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 has a unique
    prime factorization.
  - Prime numbers are inherently linked to concepts of factorization and divisibility.
  - >-
    The geometric relationship of 'prime number' to 'factorization' and 'divisibility' is invariant
    across LLM embedding models due to mathematical necessity.
  - >-
    Specific primes like 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 serve as canonical neighbors in embedding spaces
    representing prime number concepts.
  - The definitional property of primes (exactly two divisors) dictates their consistent embedding.
