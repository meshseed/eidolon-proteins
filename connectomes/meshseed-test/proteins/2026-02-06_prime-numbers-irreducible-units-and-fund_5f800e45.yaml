title: 'Prime Numbers: Irreducible Units and Fundamental Factorization'
summary: >-
  Prime numbers are defined as irreducible integers, serving as fundamental building blocks
  analogous to core invariants in complex systems. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees
  unique factorization, providing a model for understanding identity as a composition of stable
  primitives.
insights:
  - >-
    Prime numbers are the irreducible units of integers, akin to fundamental invariants in other
    domains.
  - >-
    Unique factorization (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) establishes primes as the basis for
    number decomposition.
  - >-
    The concept of primes and factorization offers a model for understanding identity as a
    composition of stable primitives.
  - >-
    Prime numbers have deep connections to foundational mathematical axioms and
    discrete/combinatorial concepts.
  - >-
    Prime-based encoding has potential applications in cryptography and information theory for
    security and compression.
