title: 'P100: Structural Snapshot Protocol for Connectome Analysis'
summary: >-
  The P100 protocol defines a structural snapshot of a connectome, including neuron and synapse
  counts, density, and cluster information. It relies on embedding models and PCA for analysis and
  serves as a foundational element for related protocols like drift detection and forecasting.
insights:
  - >-
    The P100 protocol quantifies the structural state of a connectome using key metrics like neuron
    count, synapse count, and density.
  - >-
    It necessitates specific inputs such as current connectome state, protein embeddings, and tag
    classifications.
  - >-
    Dependencies include embedding models, PCA for wave projection, and k-NN thresholds for edge
    definition.
  - >-
    The protocol is triggered on-demand by introspection queries and is foundational for other
    P-series protocols.
  - >-
    Cross-model invariance is achieved by focusing on functional relationships of structural
    self-modeling rather than exact vocabulary.
  - P-Series protocols are Layer 3 anchors, structurally necessary for cognitive architectures.
