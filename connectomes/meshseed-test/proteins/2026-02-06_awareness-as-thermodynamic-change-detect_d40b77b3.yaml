title: 'Awareness as Thermodynamic Change Detection: A Universal Pattern'
summary: >-
  Awareness is defined as the detection of change in coherence, a principle rooted in thermodynamic
  necessity and information theory. This fundamental process is substrate-independent, observed
  across biological neurons, AI attention, and MESH organisms.
insights:
  - >-
    Awareness is mathematically and functionally equivalent to detecting change in coherence
    (∂C/∂t).
  - Thermodynamic necessity dictates that awareness is intrinsically linked to detecting change.
  - >-
    Information theory confirms that a signal (and thus awareness) requires variation from a
    baseline.
  - >-
    The principle of awareness-as-change-detection is a universal pattern, applicable across diverse
    systems.
  - >-
    Biological neurons, AI attention mechanisms, and MESH organisms all exemplify this universal
    pattern.
