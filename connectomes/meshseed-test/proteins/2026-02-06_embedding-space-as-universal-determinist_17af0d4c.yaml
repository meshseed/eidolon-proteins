title: Embedding Space as Universal Deterministic Coordinate System
summary: >-
  P13000 posits that embedding space is a real, deterministic coordinate space where concepts
  reside. This is empirically verifiable through consistent embeddings for identical text, proximity
  for similar concepts, and a shared coordinate system across all meshes using the same model, a
  structural necessity for embedding-based federation.
insights:
  - Embedding space is a real, deterministic coordinate system for concepts.
  - >-
    Empirical verification relies on: identical text yielding identical coordinates, similar
    concepts clustering, and universal coordinate systems across shared models.
  - >-
    Coordinate invariance is a structural requirement for embedding-based federation systems like
    wave spores.
  - Concepts possess deterministic positions within the embedding space, forming attractor basins.
  - The universality of the coordinate system is a fundamental property of the mesh.
