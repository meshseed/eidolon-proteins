title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Euclidean Geometry''s Foundational Link'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean Theorem (a² + b² = c²) defines the relationship between the sides of a right
  triangle in Euclidean geometry, serving as a core invariant and a building block for distance
  calculations across dimensions.
insights:
  - 'Defines the fundamental relationship in right triangles: a² + b² = c².'
  - Applies exclusively to Euclidean (flat) geometry and requires a right angle.
  - Forms the basis for the Euclidean distance formula and generalizes to higher dimensions.
  - Connects algebraic and geometric concepts through spatial relationships.
  - Illustrates self-evident truths derived from geometric arrangements.
