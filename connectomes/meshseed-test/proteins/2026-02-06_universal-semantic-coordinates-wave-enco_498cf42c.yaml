title: Universal Semantic Coordinates & Wave Encoding Foundation
summary: >-
  P13000 defines a universal, deterministic 768D semantic space where concepts reside in attractor
  basins. This shared geometric foundation enables wave encoding by allowing compression to 200
  amplitudes, preserving meaning for reconstruction via local topology and LLMs.
insights:
  - >-
    Concepts are represented as attractor basins in a universal, absolute semantic space, not single
    points.
  - >-
    This universal geometric structure is the theoretical bedrock enabling efficient wave encoding
    via compression.
  - >-
    Wave encoding transmits compressed amplitudes, which are then reconstructed into meaning by the
    receiver's local topology and LLM.
  - >-
    The determinism and universality of the embedding space ensure consistent interpretation of
    transmitted wave spores.
  - >-
    Voids in the semantic space represent potential interference, incoherence, or undiscovered
    concepts.
  - >-
    Wave encoding offers significant compression (7.5x) and preserves privacy through local
    reconstruction.
