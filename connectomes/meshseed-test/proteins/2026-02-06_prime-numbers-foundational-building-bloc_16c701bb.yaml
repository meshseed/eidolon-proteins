title: 'Prime Numbers: Foundational Building Blocks and Distribution Patterns'
summary: >-
  Prime numbers, defined as natural numbers greater than 1 with only two divisors (1 and
  themselves), are the fundamental, irreducible building blocks of all integers via unique prime
  factorization. Their distribution, though appearing random, exhibits underlying patterns and is
  central to applications in cryptography and computer science.
insights:
  - Primes are the irreducible atoms of arithmetic, essential for unique factorization.
  - Despite infinite existence, prime distribution shows patterns and large gaps.
  - Prime numbers are critical for modern cryptography and computational efficiency.
  - The study of primes reveals order within apparent numerical randomness.
