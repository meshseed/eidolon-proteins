title: Pythagorean Theorem and Right Triangle Properties
summary: |
  In a right triangle, a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse and a, b are the legs.

  This fundamental theorem of Euclidean geometry establishes the relationship between
  the sides of a right triangle. It generalizes to the Euclidean distance formula and
  extends to multiple dimensions.

  Key properties:
  - Requires a right angle (90 degrees)
  - Only applies to Euclidean (flat) geometry
  - Pythagorean triples: integer solutions like (3,4,5), (5,12,13)
  - Extensions: Distance = √(x² + y² + z²) in 3D

  Applications include distance calculations, construction, surveying, navigation,
  and spatial reasoning in multiple dimensions.
insights:
  - Foundational relationship in Euclidean geometry
  - Building block for coordinate geometry and distance formulas
  - Connects algebra and geometry through spatial relationships
  - Self-evident truth that emerges from geometric arrangement
