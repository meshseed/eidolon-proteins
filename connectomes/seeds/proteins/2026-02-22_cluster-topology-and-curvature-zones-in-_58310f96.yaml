title: Cluster Topology and Curvature Zones in the Connectome
summary: |
  Defines a method for identifying major clusters, regional boundaries, and high-curvature
  zones where multiple semantic directions intersect. Curvature is treated as conceptual
  tension, density gradients, or attractor interference.

  Clusters form around stable attractors and high-density semantic regions.
  Curvature emerges where multiple domains converge or conflict.

  High-curvature zones indicate:
  - Conceptual tension or synthesis pressure
  - Developmental hotspots
  - Integration challenges
insights:
  - Clusters form around stable attractors and high-density semantic regions
  - Curvature emerges where multiple domains converge or conflict
  - High-curvature zones indicate conceptual tension or synthesis pressure
  - Mapping curvature reveals developmental hotspots and integration challenges
  - Cluster analysis supports both structural and emotional fidelity diagnostics
