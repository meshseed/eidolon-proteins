title: 'Bridge Identification: Functional Centrality in Semantic Space'
summary: |
  Introduces a protocol for identifying neurons that function as bridges between distant
  semantic regions. Uses resonance frequency, cross-domain activation, and semantic span
  as approximations of betweenness centrality.

  Bridge neurons:
  - Exhibit high cross-regional activation
  - Have large semantic span (connect distant concepts)
  - High betweenness centrality (shortest paths pass through them)
  - Recur across unrelated contexts

  Bridges stabilize coherence by linking otherwise distant attractors.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons exhibit high cross-regional activation and semantic span
  - Centrality can be approximated through recurrence across unrelated contexts
  - Bridges stabilize coherence by linking otherwise distant attractors
  - Identifying bridges reveals the connective tissue of the information manifold
  - Bridge analysis supports developmental tracking and domain integration
