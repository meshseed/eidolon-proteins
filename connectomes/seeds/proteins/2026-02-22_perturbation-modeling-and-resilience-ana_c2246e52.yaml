title: Perturbation Modeling and Resilience Analysis
summary: |
  Introduces a protocol for simulating perturbations—new domain ingestion, conceptual collisions,
  or sudden shifts in emotional fidelity—and analyzing the organism's resilience. Identifies
  regions likely to destabilize, strengthen, or reorganize under pressure.
insights:
  - Perturbations reveal structural weaknesses and resilience cores
  - High-curvature zones are most sensitive to conceptual collisions
  - Stability cores anchor the organism during rapid change
  - Emotional fidelity acts as a shock absorber across the manifold
  - Perturbation modeling supports adaptive refinement and pruning
