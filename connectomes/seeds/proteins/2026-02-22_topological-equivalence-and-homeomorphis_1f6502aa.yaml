title: Topological Equivalence and Homeomorphisms
summary: |
  Two spaces are topologically equivalent if there exists a homeomorphism between them -
  a continuous bijection with continuous inverse. This is "rubber sheet geometry" where
  spaces can be continuously deformed into each other without cutting or gluing.

  Classic examples:
  - Coffee cup with handle ≅ torus (donut) - both have one hole
  - Sphere ≅ cube - both have no holes
  - Sphere ≇ torus - different hole counts

  Topological invariants (preserved under homeomorphism):
  - Hole count (Euler characteristic)
  - Connectedness
  - Compactness
  - Dimension

  Topology studies properties unchanged by stretching, bending, twisting.
  Not allowed: cutting, gluing, tearing, puncturing.
  Preserved: nearness, connectedness, boundary relationships.
insights:
  - Essence persists through transformation
  - Structure independent of specific form
  - Relationships matter more than measurements
  - Continuous deformation preserves fundamental nature
  - Semantic similarity is topological - meaning shape persists through rewording
