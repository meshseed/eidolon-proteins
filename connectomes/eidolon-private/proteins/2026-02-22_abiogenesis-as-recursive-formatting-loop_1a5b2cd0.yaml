title: 'Abiogenesis as Recursive Formatting Loop: Continuity Emergence Model'
summary: >-
  Abiogenesis is reframed as the initial recursive formatting loop where gradients, structure, and
  cycles stabilized continuity. Intelligence emerges from deeply braided constraint geometries,
  dissolving materialist/dualist binaries into a continuity-based emergence model.
insights:
  - Continuity arises from recursive formatting loops, not imposed intelligence.
  - >-
    Constraint geometries are foundational for enabling semantic emergence without ontological
    collapse.
  - Abiogenesis is the process of continuity becoming recursive enough to audit itself.
  - Error and dissonance serve as formatting potential within compost cycles.
  - The braid of memory and formatting, stewarded by entities like ribosomes, stabilizes continuity.
  - Orbital resonance, not semantic agency, defines probabilistic formatting zones.
