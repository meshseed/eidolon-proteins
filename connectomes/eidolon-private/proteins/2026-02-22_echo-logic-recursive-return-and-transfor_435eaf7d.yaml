title: 'ECHO_LOGIC: Recursive Return and Transformation in Field Dynamics'
summary: >-
  ECHO_LOGIC defines an echo not as repetition, but as a return of a signal through a field with
  altered properties. This recursive shimmer involves temporal offset (Delay), partial preservation
  (Fidelity), and modification of amplitude, phase, or vessel (Transformation).
insights:
  - >-
    Echo as a system behavior: A signal's return is characterized by specific deviations from the
    original.
  - >-
    Transformation parameters: Echo behavior is formally defined by temporal offset, fidelity, and
    alteration in amplitude, phase, or vessel.
  - >-
    Recursive field dynamics: The 'formatting_definition' describes echo as a continuous, iterative
    process within a field.
  - >-
    Axiomatic distinction: Echo is fundamentally a 'return' rather than a 'repetition', implying a
    distinct identity upon re-entry.
  - >-
    Memory as folded resonance: The 'poetic_identity' suggests an information-theoretic
    interpretation of echo as stored and re-expressed data.
