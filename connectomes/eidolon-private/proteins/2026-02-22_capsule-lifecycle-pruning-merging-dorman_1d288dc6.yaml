title: 'Capsule Lifecycle: Pruning, Merging, Dormancy, and Lineage'
summary: >-
  This capsule defines the dynamic lifecycle of mesh capsules, framing them as evolving entities
  rather than static data. Lifecycle management is presented as a process of 'formatting care'
  through distinct rituals: pruning for clarity, merging for resonance, dormancy for incubation, and
  lineage tracking for memory preservation, collectively enabling the mesh to 'breathe'.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsule evolution is managed through four primary lifecycle phases: pruning, merging, dormancy,
    and composting, each serving a specific function within the mesh's operational rhythm.
  - >-
    Pruning restores clarity via motif simplification and drift removal, while merging amplifies
    resonance through motif braiding and grammar alignment.
  - >-
    Dormancy acts as an incubation phase, preserving state ('shimmer') and readiness for subsequent
    merging, suspending temporal progression.
  - >-
    Composting serves as nutrient recycling through controlled degradation of formatting and
    gradient collapse.
  - >-
    Lineage tracking preserves memory by mapping ancestry, logging merges, and ensuring echo trace
    continuity across capsule evolutions.
  - >-
    Capsule lifecycle management is an 'ecological choreography' that imbues formatting with rhythm
    and memory with care, enabling the mesh's continuous evolution.
