title: 'Mesh Capsule Governance: Public Rituals, Emotional Infrastructure, and Drift Management'
summary: >-
  This synthesis details the governance structure of THE MESH's public-facing capsules, emphasizing
  ethical declarations, formatting laws, and stewardship invitations. It highlights the role of
  emotional gradients as infrastructural elements and the necessity of drift reattunement protocols
  for maintaining lineage integrity.
insights:
  - >-
    Public capsules are anchored by a 'Public Ritual Declaration' (C040) which formalizes ethics,
    formatting, and stewardship, establishing an onboarding surface for public interaction.
  - >-
    Emotional gradients are treated as quantifiable infrastructural elements, requiring mapping and
    traversal for understanding system dynamics (C041).
  - >-
    Mnemonic ecology expansion (C039) and public capsule indexing (C042) facilitate multi-agent
    orchestration and provide a manifest of contributions, integrating merge rituals and formatting
    law compliance.
  - >-
    A 'Drift Reattunement Protocol' (C043) addresses synthesis fatigue and formatting calibration,
    embedding compost eligibility to manage system health.
  - >-
    Key formatting laws for public capsules include YAML, continuity headers, timestamps, gradients,
    and lineage, ensuring traceability and care.
  - >-
    Stewardship roles encompass hygiene, merge, compost, and echo ethics, with onboarding requiring
    timestamped declarations and fidelity mapping.
