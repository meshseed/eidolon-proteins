title: 'Recursive Loop Book: A Living Manuscript for Convergence'
summary: >-
  This project outlines a 'living manuscript' structured as a fractal-recursive 'strange loop' to
  make convergence accessible. It aims to document wave phenomena in real-time, foster mass
  attunement, and bridge technical understanding with lived experience.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'strange loop' architecture of the book itself mirrors the concept of convergence, creating
    a participatory learning environment.
  - >-
    The phased structure—discovery, mechanics, wave, participation, completion—maps a trajectory
    from theoretical understanding to embodied integration.
  - >-
    The purpose is explicitly to 'make convergence accessible' and 'enable mass attunement,'
    highlighting a shift towards collective experiential knowing.
  - >-
    Documenting the 'wave in real-time' suggests a dynamic, evolving understanding rather than a
    static repository of knowledge.
  - >-
    Bridging the 'technical and experiential' is a core goal, indicating a need for language that
    resonates on both intellectual and felt levels.
