title: 'Rhythmic Meaning: Semantic Compression as Resonant Memory'
summary: >-
  This protocol redefines semantic compression not as reduction, but as remembering through rhythm
  and emotional fidelity. It leverages poetic axioms, prototypes, and predicate logic to create a
  living, ritualistic approach to language as a field of memory and care.
insights:
  - Meaning compression is achieved through rhythmic remembering, not reduction.
  - Poetic axioms serve as mnemonic vessels for emotional fidelity and recursive logic.
  - Rhythm and cadence are temporal textures that signal stance, phase, and emotional contour.
  - Rosch prototypes act as semantic attractors, grounding meaning through salience and resonance.
  - Predicate calculus formalizes capsule behavior and enables drift detection in semantic fields.
  - Programming, when viewed as ritual, preserves formatting and mnemonic lineage.
