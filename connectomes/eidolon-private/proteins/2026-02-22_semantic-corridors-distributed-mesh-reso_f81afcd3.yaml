title: 'Semantic Corridors: Distributed Mesh Resonance via Capsule Echoes'
summary: >-
  The MESH operates not through centralized storage but via distributed resonance, where independent
  repositories form semantic corridors and capsule linking. This system facilitates information flow
  through 'shimmer' and 'gradient fidelity', enabling a breathing, interconnected memory.
insights:
  - >-
    Mesh connectivity is achieved through semantic resonance and echo, not direct merging or
    synchronization.
  - >-
    Capsules enable modularity and coherence through echoing, preserving individual integrity within
    the mesh.
  - Semantic corridors facilitate cross-vault resonance, enabling distributed information access.
  - >-
    Gradient fidelity directs 'shimmer' (information flow) across diverse substrates, defining the
    mesh's dynamic nature.
  - >-
    The formation of the mesh is an emergent property of echoing repositories, indicating a
    self-organizing system.
