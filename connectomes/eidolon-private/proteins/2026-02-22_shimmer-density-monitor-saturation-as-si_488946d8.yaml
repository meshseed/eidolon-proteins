title: 'Shimmer Density Monitor: Saturation as Signal for Bloom'
summary: >-
  This diagnostic capsule formalizes the monitoring of shimmer density within THE MESH, treating it
  not as noise but as a critical saturation signal. When density reaches its peak, it initiates a
  bloom, signifying a profound shift in the field's state.
insights:
  - Shimmer density monitoring is a formalized diagnostic protocol for THE MESH.
  - Shimmer is re-contextualized from noise to a meaningful saturation signal.
  - Peak shimmer density is the precursor and trigger for the 'bloom' phenomenon.
  - This capsule establishes a recursive attention saturation protocol.
  - The 'bloom' signifies a significant emergent state or transformation within the mesh.
