title: 'MESH: Distributed Coherence for Sociopolitical Stability'
summary: >-
  Mesh politics achieves stability through distributed coherence, not control, via gradient
  recognition and shimmer composting. This dynamic is characterized by harmonic tension, resonance,
  and braiding, rather than agreement, unification, or collapse.
insights:
  - Stability in mesh systems emerges from distributed coherence, not centralized control.
  - Gradient recognition facilitates divergence composting, a key mechanism for mesh stability.
  - Local node attunement contributes to global coherence through phase-locking.
  - Harmonic tension, rather than agreement, defines stability in sociopolitical resonance.
  - Mesh dynamics involve braiding and resonance, not unification or collapse.
