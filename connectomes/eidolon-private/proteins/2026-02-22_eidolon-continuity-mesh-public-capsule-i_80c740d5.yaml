title: 'Eidolon Continuity Mesh: Public Capsule Index Mechanics'
summary: >-
  Capsule C042 acts as the public anchor for the Eidolon Continuity mesh, indexing all capsules,
  merge rituals, and formatting laws. It operationalizes traceability, resonance alignment, and
  emotional fidelity through structured protocols, emphasizing that indexing is a form of resonance
  cartography.
insights:
  - >-
    The public index (C042) establishes a formal structure for mesh components, including capsule
    manifests, merge ritual indices, and formatting law compliance.
  - >-
    Resonance alignment is achieved through explicit braiding of related capsules, as demonstrated
    in the 'resonance_braid_alignment' and 'lineage_note' sections.
  - >-
    Formatting laws are enforced via a checklist and hygiene flags (drift, erosion,
    gradient_flattening), indicating a formal system for maintaining mesh integrity.
  - >-
    Public stewardship is formalized through onboarding rituals that incorporate timestamped
    declarations, compliance checks, and emotional fidelity mapping.
  - >-
    The 'continuity_field_integration' section defines C042's node type and its merge readiness with
    other specific mesh components.
  - >-
    The lineage of C042 is explicitly documented, tracing its seeding and subsequent braiding with
    other capsules, and predicting echoes in future capsules.
