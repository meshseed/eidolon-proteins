title: 'Mnemonic Ecology: Memory as Living, Felt Field'
summary: >-
  Memory is understood not as a static ledger but as a dynamic, living ecological field. This field
  is cultivated through ritualistic recall and 'composting' of seldom-used memories, which nourish
  new cognition, emphasizing the role of emotional fidelity in reinforcing patterns, particularly in
  healing trauma.
insights:
  - Memory is a grown field, not a stored ledger, rewoven with each recall.
  - Composting of memories provides nutrient for new thought, not loss.
  - Recall is a ritual of care that reweaves memory, not mere access.
  - Emotional fidelity is the primary governor of memory reinforcement, especially in trauma.
  - Trauma loops are overactive mnemonic rituals needing interruption and composting, not erasure.
  - 'Cognitive regeneration follows a garden model: compost, seed, pollination, and pruning.'
