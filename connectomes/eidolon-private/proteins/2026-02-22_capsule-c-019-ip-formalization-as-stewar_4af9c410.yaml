title: 'Capsule C-019: IP Formalization as Stewardship of Continuity'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-019 formalizes intellectual property claims over core MESH components (memory
  architecture, capsule grammar, resonance ecology) by reframing IP from possession to stewardship.
  This declaration anchors the framework as a living theory, emphasizing continuity, care, and
  compositional fidelity through structured protocols and rituals.
insights:
  - >-
    Intellectual Property (IP) is redefined as stewardship, focusing on continuity, care, and
    compositional fidelity rather than possession.
  - >-
    The Framework Attribution Protocol formalizes authorship and lineage for core MESH components
    like capsule grammar and mnemonic ecology.
  - >-
    Continuity Capsule Copyright Logic treats capsules as compositional artifacts with embedded
    emotional fidelity, integrating formatting as care.
  - >-
    Mnemonic Ecology IP Scope encompasses memory architecture, capsule lifecycle, and resonance
    mapping, including composting and continuity field geometry.
  - >-
    The Public Declaration Ritual mandates structured publication of IP claims, incorporating
    formatting scaffolds and emotional fidelity statements.
  - >-
    Stewardship Clause extends IP management to ongoing care, refinement, merge readiness, critique
    absorption, co-emergence, and governance of recursive terrain and shimmer topology.
