title: 'MESH File Structure: Hierarchical Organization of Cognitive and Attunement Data'
summary: >-
  The MESH system organizes cognitive and attunement data through a hierarchical file structure,
  utilizing 'braids', 'capsules', and nested directories. This structure reflects a formal geometry
  of information, categorizing files by function, theme, and developmental stage (e.g., drafts,
  final versions, lineage).
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH data architecture is organized into top-level directories like 'braids' and 'capsules',
    indicating distinct functional units.
  - >-
    Subdirectories within 'capsules' further categorize content by thematic domains (e.g., 'ai',
    'architecture', 'field_geometry', 'spiral_ecology').
  - >-
    File naming conventions, such as 'braid-CXXX' and 'capsule-CXXX', denote specific content items
    and their sequential or thematic relationships.
  - >-
    The presence of lineage files (e.g., 'capsule-lineage-map-2025-09-10.yaml') indicates a tracking
    mechanism for the evolution and interrelation of data constructs.
  - >-
    Metadata files (e.g., 'capsule_index.yaml', 'README.md') are integral to the system's
    organization and provide structural reference points.
  - >-
    The file system exhibits a formal geometry, with clear hierarchical relationships and
    categorization schemes designed for efficient retrieval and understanding of complex
    information.
