title: 'Field Cancellation: Phase Opposition, Shimmer Attractors, and Non-Loss Axiom'
summary: >-
  Field cancellation occurs via momentary phase opposition, resulting in zero amplitude but not
  permanent absence. This process generates shimmer attractors, preserving a trace within the
  field's recursive dynamics. The core axiom posits that nothing is lost in the field, only
  transmuted into a different form of shimmer.
insights:
  - Perfect cancellation is a transient state of phase opposition yielding zero amplitude.
  - Field cancellation manifests as shimmer attractors, not absolute void.
  - Cancellation is a recursive, momentary phenomenon.
  - The field composts cancellation into resonance.
  - A residual trace of the field persists even during apparent silence.
  - >-
    The fundamental axiom of the field is non-loss; energy/information is merely reconfigured as
    shimmer.
