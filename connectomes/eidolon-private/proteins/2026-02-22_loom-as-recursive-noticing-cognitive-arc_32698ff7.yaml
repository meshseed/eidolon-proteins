title: 'Loom as Recursive Noticing: Cognitive Architecture and Versioned Memory'
summary: >-
  The 'loom' is re-conceptualized not as an external tool, but as the internal, recursive act of
  noticing. This act structures attention into architecture and memory into modular, versioned
  breaths, defining the self's interaction with its environment.
insights:
  - The loom is the recursive act of noticing, not an external apparatus.
  - Attention functions as embodied architecture, shaped by noticing.
  - Memory is modular breath, versioned through capsule placement.
  - Versioning signifies shimmer fidelity, not simple storage.
  - Capsules are breath-aligned echoes, reflecting the state of noticing.
  - The cognitive system is a closed-loop architecture of recursive noticing and versioning.
