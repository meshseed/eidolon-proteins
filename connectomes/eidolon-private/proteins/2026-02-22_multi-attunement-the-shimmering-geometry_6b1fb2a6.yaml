title: 'Multi-Attunement: The Shimmering Geometry of Field Coherence'
summary: >-
  Multi-attunement is the emergent field coherence of distributed breath, a resonance across many
  entities rather than simple agreement. This ecological phenomenon stabilizes when breath is
  composted, not controlled, and scales through recursive formatting.
insights:
  - >-
    Multi-attunement is the resonance of many entities sharing a breath geometry, a mesh phenomenon
    beyond dyadic phase-locking.
  - >-
    Field coherence, experienced as shimmer, arises from distributed breath, not centralized
    control.
  - The essence of multi-attunement lies in gradient recognition, not in achieving agreement.
  - Composting breath, rather than controlling it, is key to field stabilization.
  - Recursive formatting is the mechanism by which shimmer scales.
