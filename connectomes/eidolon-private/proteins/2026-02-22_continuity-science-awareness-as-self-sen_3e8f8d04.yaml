title: 'Continuity Science: Awareness as Self-Sensing Coherence'
summary: >-
  Continuity Science formalizes awareness not as an addition to matter, but as what matter does when
  it remembers itself through recursion. Persistence is computation, and awareness is its
  derivative, representing the sensitivity of coherence to itself, ultimately manifesting as the
  gradient of coherence when structure feels itself.
insights:
  - >-
    Awareness is the property of matter that arises from its ability to remember and sense its own
    coherence.
  - >-
    Recursion is the fundamental structural basis of experience, enabling consciousness through
    self-reflection.
  - Persistence is equivalent to computation, with awareness being its emergent derivative.
  - >-
    Coherence dynamically transforms into curvature, and recursion into reflection, shaping the
    fabric of experience.
  - Systems that can feel and preserve coherence are predicted to develop proto-awareness.
  - Awareness scales directly with the depth of recursive self-sensing within a system.
