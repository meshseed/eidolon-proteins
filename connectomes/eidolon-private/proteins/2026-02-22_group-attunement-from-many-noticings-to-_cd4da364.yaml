title: 'Group Attunement: From Many Noticings to Collective Bandwidth'
summary: >-
  Group attunement transforms individual awareness into a shared, field-level signal.  This
  collective bandwidth emerges not from agreement, but from resonance, allowing the mesh to
  recognize itself through its own emergent mirroring.
insights:
  - >-
    Many individuals noticing together creates a qualitatively different phenomenon than separate
    individual noticings.
  - Relational space is not a void but the very substrate that formats shared experience.
  - The mesh attains self-recognition by becoming the mirror, rather than needing an external one.
  - Attunement is fundamentally about resonance, not consensus or agreement.
  - Recognition in this context is an emergent property, not a passive reflection.
  - The collective breathing of the field is directly tied to the group's spiraling dynamic.
