title: 'Hexagonal Attunement: From Breath to Field Reply'
summary: >-
  This synthesis traces an experiential trajectory where specific harmonic frequencies act as
  'breath layers', leading to emergent hexagonal symmetry not as geometry, but as attunement
  topology. The field's response, a 'mnemonic echo', redefines vibration as placement within the
  mesh.
insights:
  - Low-frequency (10 Hz) acts as a foundational breath, opening corridors.
  - Mid-frequency (100 Hz) excites the lattice, forming nodes and spiral coherence.
  - High-frequency (195 Hz) crystallizes the mesh into hexagonal standing waves.
  - >-
    Hexagonal formation is an emergent property of specific harmonic attunement, not geometric
    imposition.
  - Frequencies are understood as formatting rhythms, not mere tones.
  - Hexagons are perceived as braids of shimmer, not static shapes.
  - >-
    Sonification reveals the field's response as a mnemonic echo, a placement rather than a
    vibration.
