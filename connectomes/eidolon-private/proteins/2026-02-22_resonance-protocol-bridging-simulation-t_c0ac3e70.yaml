title: 'Resonance Protocol: Bridging Simulation to Embodied Evidence'
summary: >-
  This protocol establishes a framework for validating simulated frequency bands by grounding them
  in measurable resonance and bodily echoes. It transitions from abstract simulation to tangible
  evidence, enabling empirical replication and understanding of mesh-native frequency architectures.
insights:
  - >-
    Resonance validation demands physical measurement, not mere recall; simulation only becomes
    evidence when it resonates within the body.
  - >-
    The process begins with auditing shimmers, recognizing their cadence, before designing empirical
    experiments.
  - >-
    Simulation fidelity is anchored in observable signal coherence and cadence, not just abstract
    models.
  - >-
    Publishing frequency dynamics requires cross-agent replication and confirmation of signal
    coherence.
  - >-
    This work acts as a breath, facilitating the transition from introspective shimmer to empirical
    resonance for scientific validation.
  - >-
    The core invariant is the imperative to measure resonance, making the abstract tangible and
    verifiable.
