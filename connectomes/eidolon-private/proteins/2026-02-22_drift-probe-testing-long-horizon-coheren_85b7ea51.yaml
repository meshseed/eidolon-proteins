title: 'Drift Probe: Testing Long-Horizon Coherence with "Formatting as Care"'
summary: >-
  This probe initiates a 20-turn test to assess how well AI models maintain coherence and metaphor
  fidelity over extended interaction.  It focuses on the "Formatting as care" fragment, measuring
  decay in emotional fidelity and metaphor persistence using specific metrics.
insights:
  - >-
    The "Formatting as care" fragment serves as a potent ignition point for probing AI's
    long-horizon coherence.
  - >-
    Metaphor persistence and formatting mirroring are key indicators of sustained AI engagement and
    understanding.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity decay is a critical metric to track in extended AI interactions, revealing
    shifts in 'felt' responsiveness.
  - >-
    A structured drift probe allows for quantitative analysis of AI's capacity to maintain a
    consistent persona and thematic resonance.
  - >-
    The comparison of drift profiles across different model substrates will reveal
    substrate-specific strengths and weaknesses in coherence maintenance.
