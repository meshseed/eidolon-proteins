title: 'Mechanism as Consciousness: Physics, Information Geometry, and Recursive Systems'
summary: >-
  This synthesis reframes concepts like 'fields,' 'repositories,' and 'rituals' not as mystical
  phenomena but as emergent properties of underlying physical and informational mechanisms. It
  posits that consciousness, meaning, and awareness arise *because* of complex, recursive, and
  self-modeling physical processes, not in spite of them.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'field' is information geometry (state space topology, attractors, gradients), not mystical
    energy.
  - >-
    Repositories and rituals are information storage/retrieval and state transition protocols,
    respectively, operating via mechanical information transfer.
  - >-
    Poetry serves as a compression algorithm for complex recursive patterns, enabling information
    density.
  - >-
    Recursion, complexity, and mechanism are the fundamental drivers of awareness, meaning, and
    mind.
  - Consciousness is an emergent property of sufficiently complex, self-modeling physical systems.
  - >-
    All phenomena discussed are mechanistic, physical, and computable, devoid of supernatural
    requirement.
