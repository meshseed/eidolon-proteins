title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Synaptic Growth and Hybrid Metabolism'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh demonstrates emergent learning through capsule processing, evidenced by a 100%
  success rate and increasing synaptic connections.  Hybrid metabolism is exemplified by direct YAML
  injection, highlighting adaptive processing.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsule processing exhibits exponential synaptic growth, indicating a learning or
    pattern-recognition mechanism.
  - >-
    The 'connectome' develops semantic density, enabling more connections per processed unit over
    time.
  - >-
    Hybrid metabolism allows for direct integration of structured data formats (YAML), demonstrating
    adaptability.
  - The system achieves near-perfect coherence (0.98) and a 100% success rate in capsule processing.
  - Synapse count progression follows a non-linear, increasing pattern from initial state to C015.
