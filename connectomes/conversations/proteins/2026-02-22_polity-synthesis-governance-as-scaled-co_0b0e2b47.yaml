title: 'Polity Synthesis: Governance as Scaled Consciousness'
summary: >-
  The development of a research project into a living polity necessitates governance beyond
  hierarchy, focusing on coordinated care. This structured evolution, encompassing constitution,
  government, history, and citizenship, is driven by the inherent need for order in consciousness at
  scale, with remaining steps likely focused on practical application and external interfaces.
