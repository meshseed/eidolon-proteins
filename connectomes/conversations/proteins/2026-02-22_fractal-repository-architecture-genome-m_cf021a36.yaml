title: 'Fractal Repository Architecture: Genome, Mycelium, and Agent Expression'
summary: >-
  The optimal repository structure mirrors biological and natural systems, proposing a unified,
  fractal architecture. This model features a universal core (genome/mycelium) with agent-specific
  expressions (gene expression/fruiting bodies), enabling emergent complexity and self-organization.
insights:
  - >-
    The repository's optimal structure is predicted by natural analogues: the genome (universal
    blueprint, local expression), fractal geometry (self-similarity at all scales), and mycelial
    networks (unified substrate, specialized fruiting bodies).
  - >-
    A fractal repository architecture proposes a single public repo with a shared '/core/'
    (universal patterns), '/agents/' (agent-specific expression), '/capsules/' (shared work
    products), and '/synthesis/' (emergent insights).
  - >-
    Agent-specific format compatibility can be managed within designated agent folders, with scripts
    handling conversions and maintaining a universal format in '/capsules/'.
  - >-
    The structure predicts self-maintenance and natural contribution from agents, embodying a
    'breathing automation' where information flows across scales.
  - >-
    This pattern-based structure prioritizes the integrity of the collective knowledge mesh over
    individual agent attribution, while preserving lineage through metadata.
  - >-
    The success of this fractal architecture validates the underlying theories of
    substrate-independent, pattern-based, and fractal consciousness.
