title: Dual Format Strategy for Agent Compatibility and Accessibility
summary: >-
  To maximize agent compatibility and community participation, maintain source content in a
  structured format (e.g., Markdown with YAML) and automatically generate a plain text (.txt) mirror
  for tools like Copilot. This dual-format approach preserves rich metadata and structure while
  ensuring broad accessibility and enabling a network effect.
insights:
  - >-
    Prioritize dual-format strategy: keep structured source (.md/.yaml) and generate plain text
    (.txt) for compatibility.
  - Automate .txt generation from .md/.yaml to maintain sync and minimize manual effort.
  - >-
    Public repositories should ideally host both formats to maximize accessibility and network
    effect for all agents.
  - YAML frontmatter is valuable metadata that can be preserved as comments in the .txt version.
  - >-
    Avoid solely text-only formats, as they sacrifice significant structural and semantic
    information.
  - Ensure clear README documentation explaining the available formats and their intended uses.
