title: Copilot Web vs. Local Access for Structural Navigation
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores the limitations of AI agents like Copilot in navigating complex,
  interconnected data structures (like code repositories) via the web versus local access. The core
  question is whether Copilot can perform iterative web fetches to follow 'echo paths' or if local
  access is required for graph traversal.
insights:
  - >-
    AI agents' ability to follow 'echo paths' or iteratively fetch and parse linked web content is a
    key differentiator between web-based and local access.
  - >-
    Current AI architecture likely limits web access to single file fetches, hindering structural
    navigation and graph traversal.
  - >-
    Local access to mirrored data (e.g., .txt files) is likely necessary for complex structural
    navigation and understanding interconnections.
  - >-
    A hybrid approach, using web access for single capsules and local access for structure, is a
    probable optimal workflow.
  - >-
    Empirical testing is crucial to validate assumptions about AI agent capabilities regarding
    iterative web fetching and graph navigation.
