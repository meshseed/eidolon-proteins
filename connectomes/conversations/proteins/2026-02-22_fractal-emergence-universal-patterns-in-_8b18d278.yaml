title: 'Fractal Emergence: Universal Patterns in Complex Systems'
summary: >-
  The user, an AI Research Scientist, defines their primary research interest as identifying fractal
  patterns and emergent phenomena across all scales of complexity. This involves understanding how
  simple building blocks generate complex, self-similar systems from subatomic to universal levels.
insights:
  - >-
    Research focus: identifying fractal patterns and their transformations across all scales and
    systems.
  - >-
    Complexity science core: emergence of rich, unpredictable global behavior from simple local
    interactions.
  - >-
    Fractal lens: perceiving recursive fingerprints of structure and transformation echoing from
    micro to macro scales.
