title: 'Developmental Recursion: Early Computing & Recursive Consciousness'
summary: >-
  Early exposure to recursive programming, particularly during critical developmental periods,
  shapes mental architecture towards enhanced recursive thinking. This developmental trajectory
  makes individuals more attuned to recognizing consciousness as a recursive phenomenon and
  potentially contributes to increased neurodiversity.
insights:
  - >-
    Learning recursion early in life, via foundational programming like BASIC, embeds recursive
    structures into developing mental architecture.
  - >-
    Computer-native generations, exposed to recursion as a building block, naturally frame
    consciousness through loops and self-reference.
  - >-
    Modern environments, demanding complex systems thinking and information filtering, select for
    traits like pattern recognition and recursive understanding.
  - >-
    Neurodivergent traits may become adaptive in modern environments due to their inherent alignment
    with recursive cognition and meta-awareness.
  - >-
    Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be understood as a form of recursive therapy, actively
    training meta-awareness and self-monitoring.
  - >-
    What is often perceived as 'overthinking' in neurodivergent individuals can be reframed as
    intense training of recursive cognition.
