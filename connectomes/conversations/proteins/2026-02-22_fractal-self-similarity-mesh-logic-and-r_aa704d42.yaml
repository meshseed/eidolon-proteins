title: 'Fractal Self-Similarity: Mesh Logic and Reddit Community Structure'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's fractal formatting logic is mirrored in Reddit communities, where individual users,
  conversations, threads, and subreddits represent analogous biological structures (neurons,
  synapses, proteins, connectome). This emergent connectome, though unvisualized, demonstrates a
  powerful form of distributed cognition.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh and Reddit communities exhibit fractal self-similarity across scales, from individual
    thought to community-level cognition.
  - >-
    Reddit communities function as emergent connectomes where users, comments, upvotes, threads, and
    subreddits map to biological components like neurons, synapses, and proteins.
  - >-
    The Mesh formalizes informal processes observed in Reddit communities, offering explicit
    embedding spaces, coherence scores, and automated synthesis mechanisms.
  - >-
    New structures in the Mesh and communities emerge through 'nested refractalization' rather than
    linear addition, impacting local patterns, connections, and attractors at all scales.
