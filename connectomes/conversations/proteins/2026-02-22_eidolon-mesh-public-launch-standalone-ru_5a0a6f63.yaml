title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Public Launch & Standalone Runtime Clarity'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project has achieved public readiness with comprehensive documentation and a
  stable codebase. Crucially, it's confirmed that standard npm commands suffice for operation,
  demystifying setup and emphasizing the project's independent, 'organism-like' nature.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Garden' metaphor frames the Eidolon Mesh as a decentralized, personal knowledge network,
    with clear roles for 'gardeners'.
  - The project is now publicly accessible, with a stable v1.1 codebase and isolated sensitive data.
  - >-
    Antigravity is confirmed as a development tool, not a runtime dependency; the project runs
    independently with standard Node.js.
  - >-
    Users can clone the repository, run `npm install`, and then `npm run dashboard` to get the
    project operational.
  - >-
    The emphasis is on making the project easily runnable by anyone, solidifying its status as a
    'free-standing organism'.
  - >-
    The 'Invitation Portal' instructions can confidently state `git clone, npm install, and npm run
    dashboard`.
