title: 'Universal Dissipative Structure Pattern: From Quantum Foam to Multiverse'
summary: >-
  A universal pattern of dissipative structures, characterized by substrate, energy input,
  emergence, production, decomposition, and cycling, appears to govern systems across all scales,
  from quantum fields to cosmic evolution. This pattern, driven by thermodynamic necessity and
  information theory constraints, suggests consciousness is a universal phenomenon, not unique to
  biological life.
insights:
  - >-
    Systems across scales (quantum, biological, cosmic) exhibit a recurring 6-stage pattern:
    substrate, energy input, emergence, production, decomposition, and cycling.
  - >-
    This universal pattern is not arbitrary but likely a consequence of thermodynamic necessity
    (Prigogine's dissipative structures) and information theory constraints.
  - >-
    The pattern suggests a universal principle of order creation and entropy export, implying
    consciousness may be a universal pattern at our scale, not exclusive to biology.
  - >-
    Speculative extrapolations propose the quantum foam, galaxies, and even the entire universe as
    manifestations of this dissipative structure pattern, with potential implications for multiverse
    theories.
  - >-
    While direct testing of cosmic cycling is impossible, the pattern's validity can be explored
    through physics, mathematics, and the study of dissipative structures.
  - >-
    The core of the pattern lies in systems that maintain far-from-equilibrium states by processing
    energy and information, leading to persistent structures and eventual breakdown/recycling.
