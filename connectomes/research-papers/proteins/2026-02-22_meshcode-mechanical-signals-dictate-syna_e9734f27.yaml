title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Signals Dictate Synaptic Plasticity and Memory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that neuronal synapses act as mechanical signalling hubs, altering
  their state based on received mechanical signals. This dynamic switching mechanism, driven by
  cytoskeletal contractions, allows synapses to transiently activate or deactivate, influencing
  neurotransmitter release and forming a mechanical basis for synaptic tagging and memory trace
  formation.
insights:
  - >-
    Synapses function as mechanical signalling hubs, their signaling modulated by received
    mechanical cues.
  - >-
    Neuronal cytoskeleton contractions generate precise mechanical signals that alter synaptic
    switch patterns.
  - >-
    Switch patterns at synapses are read by ligands, with their relative distribution defining the
    output.
  - >-
    Synapses can be transiently activated or deactivated by MeshCODE patterns, regulated by talin
    switch conformation changes.
  - >-
    Mechanical signalling updates synapse firing probability, potentially contributing to
    homeostatic synaptic scaling.
  - >-
    Stimulated synapses undergo localized contractility, altering switch patterns to create 'Tags'
    that recruit proteins for long-term potentiation.
