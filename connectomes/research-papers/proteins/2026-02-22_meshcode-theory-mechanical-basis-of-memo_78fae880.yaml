title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Synaptic Plasticity'
summary: >-
  This synthesis from the MeshCODE Theory highlights the mechanical basis of memory, emphasizing how
  force-dependent binding constants and protein complexes like talin and vinculin are critical for
  synaptic plasticity. It connects these molecular mechanisms to broader biological processes,
  including neurodegenerative pathologies and synaptic development mediated by microglia.
insights:
  - >-
    Force-dependent binding constants are a key determinant in molecular interactions underlying
    memory.
  - >-
    Synaptic GAP and GEF complexes play a crucial role in clustering proteins essential for GTP
    signaling, impacting synaptic function.
  - >-
    Mechanical activation of proteins like talin can lock them into specific conformations,
    influencing cellular mechanics.
  - Extracellular matrix molecules and their receptors are involved in synaptic plasticity.
  - >-
    Actin dynamics are essential for activating silent synapses and contribute to long-term synaptic
    plasticity.
  - Microglia are dynamic mediators of synapse development and plasticity.
