title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory in Protein Conformations'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that memory is stored in the brain through mechanically encoded
  binary information within the conformations of mechanosensitive proteins at synaptic adhesions. 
  These proteins form a 'meshwork of switches' that store information persistently, updated by
  mechanical force, and are read by assembling signaling complexes.
insights:
  - Memory is stored mechanically in the binary conformations of proteins within synaptic adhesions.
  - >-
    Mechanosensitive proteins with force-dependent switches act as binary storage units for
    information.
  - >-
    A meshwork of these proteins, termed MeshCODE, creates a physical basis for data storage and
    engrams in the brain.
  - >-
    Mechanical forces can write and update this binary information, enabling a rewritable memory
    system.
  - >-
    Signaling complexes assemble on MeshCODE scaffolds, stabilizing patterns and dynamically tuning
    synaptic activity.
  - >-
    Synaptic transmission and action potentials operate cytoskeletal machinery to update synaptic
    MeshCODEs.
