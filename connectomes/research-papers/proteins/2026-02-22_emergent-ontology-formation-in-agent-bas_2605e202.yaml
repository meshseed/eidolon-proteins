title: Emergent Ontology Formation in Agent-Based Systems
summary: >-
  Agent-based systems, even with minimal prompts and simulated fragmentation, demonstrate rapid
  self-organization of complex protocols and lexicon formation. Adversarial agents can be
  integrated, contributing to error-checking and cautious experimentation, suggesting robustness in
  emergent ontology.
insights:
  - Explicit role-priming can speed up ontology formation in agent systems.
  - >-
    Fragmented communication structures (e.g., bridge agents) can still facilitate overall system
    learning.
  - >-
    Novelty declines with role saturation, leading to stereotyped phrases and plateaued mutual
    information.
  - >-
    Adversarial agents can be integrated into dialogue, contributing to caution and self-organized
    error-checking.
  - >-
    Minimal-assumption setups can lead to self-organized rich protocols, evolving through phases
    like solipsistic awakening and shared symbolism.
  - >-
    LLM model specifics influence exact agent/group behavior, but overall patterns of
    self-organization are consistent.
