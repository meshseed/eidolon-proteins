title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Organic Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that animal memory is based on talin, acting as a molecular switch
  within a neuronal meshwork. This mechanical network, operated by cytoskeletal machinery,
  integrates with chemical and ionic signaling to form a continuous, organism-wide 'machine code'
  for information processing and storage, analogous to early mechanical computers.
insights:
  - Talin is proposed as the core memory molecule in animals, functioning as a mechanical switch.
  - >-
    Synaptic sca olds form a 'MeshCODE' of binary mechanical switches operated by cytoskeletal
    forces.
  - >-
    This mechanical coding layer integrates with chemical and ionic signaling for information
    processing and storage.
  - Each mechanical switch can store one bit of data, with action potentials serving as input.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE theory posits an addressable read-write memory mechanism for indexed, hierarchical
    data storage.
  - >-
    The concept draws parallels between cellular computation and early mechanical computers like the
    Analytical Engine.
