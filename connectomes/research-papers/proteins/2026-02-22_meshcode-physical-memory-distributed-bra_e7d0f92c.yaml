title: 'MeshCODE: Physical Memory & Distributed Brain Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that the brain utilizes physical, binary switches (like talin) within
  synapses to store and process information, enabling rapid reaction times despite slow
  electrochemical transmission. This framework suggests the cortex functions as an array of memory
  modules, capable of storing vast amounts of data (estimated in petabytes) and performing
  distributed computation across the entire organism.
insights:
  - >-
    The brain's rapid processing is attributed to neurons and synapses being pre-primed with
    constantly updated information, a mechanism facilitated by physical binary switches.
  - >-
    MeshCODE theory posits a physical location for data storage in the brain, enabling an
    addressable read-write memory system.
  - >-
    The cortical structure, arranged in ordered columns, supports the hypothesis of the brain cortex
    acting as an array of memory modules.
  - >-
    Each synapse, potentially containing numerous talin molecules, could encode significant amounts
    of data, leading to a massive global brain memory capacity (e.g., 10 petabytes).
  - >-
    Computation is predominantly performed in the brain but distributed across the entire organism,
    leveraging this physical data storage.
