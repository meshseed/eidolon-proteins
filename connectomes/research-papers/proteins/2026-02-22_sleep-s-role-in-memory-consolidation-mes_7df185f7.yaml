title: 'Sleep''s Role in Memory Consolidation: MeshCODE Theory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits sleep is crucial for memory consolidation, acting as a data management
  system for the brain's cortical storage. Deep sleep allows for system-level data stabilization,
  while REM sleep actively processes and writes new information into the cortical MeshCODEs, akin to
  database rebuilding.
insights:
  - >-
    Sleep is essential for processing and integrating new information with existing memories in the
    cortical MeshCODEs.
  - >-
    Deep sleep may facilitate the return of the cytoskeleton and data storage to homeostasis,
    stabilizing newly formed memories.
  - >-
    REM sleep is hypothesized to be the active phase where the brain processes, moves, and writes
    new data into specific brain regions.
  - >-
    The brain's memory storage operates like a database requiring regular maintenance, with sleep
    serving this function.
