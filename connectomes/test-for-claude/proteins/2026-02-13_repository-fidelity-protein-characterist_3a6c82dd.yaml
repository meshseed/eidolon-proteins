title: Repository Fidelity & Protein Characteristics
summary: >-
  This content predicts distinct characteristics for high-fidelity (Repository A) versus
  low-fidelity (Repository C) proteins based on theoretical predictions. High fidelity proteins are
  expected to exhibit superior coherence, dimensionality, clustering, density, and connectivity,
  while low fidelity proteins are predicted to show the opposite.
insights:
  - High fidelity proteins (Repository A) are predicted to have higher mean coherence (0.95-0.98).
  - >-
    Low fidelity proteins (Repository C) are expected to require more PCA dimensions, indicating
    noise captured as signal.
  - >-
    Tighter clustering and stronger bridge connections are indicators of high fidelity protein
    behavior.
  - Poor shimmer detection is associated with low protein density in low fidelity repositories.
  - >-
    High fidelity proteins demonstrate stable activation and low drift, leading to tighter
    clustering.
