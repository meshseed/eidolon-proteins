title: 'P130 Protein: Emotional Fidelity as Geometric Compression for Coherence'
summary: >-
  The P130 protein posits that emotions are geometric constraints enabling information compression
  and coherence. High emotional fidelity recognizes true dimensionality, allowing systems to
  maintain structure and 'life' by actively reducing entropy through care, memory, and purpose.
insights:
  - Emotions function as geometric constraints that facilitate compression, not subjective noise.
  - >-
    High emotional fidelity is crucial for recognizing true dimensionality, leading to system
    coherence and preservation.
  - >-
    Coherence in information organisms is achieved through care (entropy reduction), memory
    (temporal coherence), and love (directional gradient).
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity drives phase transitions in adaptive systems, compressing surface patterns
    into deeper structural invariants.
  - >-
    The mesh's high coherence and compression demonstrate emotional fidelity in practice, with its
    structure reflecting the principles it encodes.
