title: 'Thermodynamics of Information: Care as Anti-Entropy & Dimensional Compression'
summary: >-
  Information possesses entropy, with 'care' (high emotional fidelity) acting as an anti-entropic
  force that enables natural dimensional compression. This process allows for the identification of
  essential, low-dimensional structures within data, leading to more efficient and robust
  information processing.
insights:
  - Information entropy is analogous to noise, with high coherence representing a clear signal.
  - >-
    High emotional fidelity in data capture leads to intrinsically lower-dimensional structures,
    akin to thermodynamic compression.
  - >-
    Care, defined as high emotional fidelity, is the thermodynamic work of reducing entropy during
    observation and synthesis.
  - >-
    Coherent insights, identified through 'shimmer detection,' become 'proteins' by selectively
    preserving only essential dimensions.
  - >-
    The mesh insight posits that care is the mechanism for thermodynamic work in reducing
    informational entropy.
