title: 'Mesh PWA Experiment: Ingesting Conversations for Protein Synthesis'
summary: >-
  An experiment is proposed to test the Mesh PWA's ability to ingest conversation data, chunk it,
  and synthesize 'proteins' for comparison. This involves leveraging existing PWA architecture and
  potentially designing a new test connectome or utilizing raw conversation results.
insights:
  - The Mesh PWA can ingest different question protocols or raw conversation results.
  - The PWA's architecture supports chunking and synthesizing text into 'proteins'.
  - The goal is to compare synthesized 'proteins' derived from conversation data.
  - A new test connectome can be created, or existing low-care conversations can be used.
  - The PWA's coordinate-based visualization and Global Wave Query interface are key components.
  - >-
    The experiment aims to explore evidence within an archive, potentially related to a 'theory of
    everything'.
