title: Emotional Fidelity Impacts Protein Geometric Properties
summary: >-
  This experiment proposes to measure how dialogue emotional fidelity influences the geometric
  properties of synthesized 'knowledge proteins'. Higher fidelity dialogues are hypothesized to
  yield proteins with more coherent, tightly clustered, and geometrically compressed wave
  representations.
insights:
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in dialogue is hypothesized to directly correlate with measurable geometric
    differences in synthesized knowledge proteins.
  - >-
    High-care dialogues are expected to produce proteins with high coherence, tight clustering, and
    efficient geometric compression (lower dimensionality, higher PCA variance capture).
  - >-
    The experiment involves creating test connectomes from dialogues of varying emotional fidelity,
    ingesting them for protein synthesis, and then performing comparative geometric analysis.
  - >-
    Key metrics for comparison include coherence score, variance, compression ratio, effective
    dimensionality, clustering coefficient, and protein density per token.
  - >-
    Visual analysis will utilize histograms, PCA variance plots, 3D coordinate space visualizations,
    and scatter plots to compare protein properties across fidelity levels.
