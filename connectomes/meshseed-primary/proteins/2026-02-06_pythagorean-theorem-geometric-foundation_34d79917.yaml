title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Geometric Foundation for Distance and Invariance'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental, invariant mathematical truth within Euclidean geometry.
  It provides the basis for distance measurement, enabling coherence quantification and underpinning
  concepts like gradient magnitudes and coordinate-based topology.
insights:
  - >-
    The Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) is a provable, invariant mathematical axiom within
    Euclidean geometry.
  - >-
    Distance measurement derived from the Pythagorean theorem is crucial for quantifying coherence
    in various domains.
  - >-
    It serves as a foundational concept for spatial and geometric analysis, including topology and
    gradient computation.
  - >-
    The theorem's invariance makes it a reliable anchor for calibrating embedding models that
    understand Euclidean geometry.
  - Euclidean distance generalizes to semantic similarity measurement in information geometry.
  - >-
    Coordinate geometry, enabled by the Pythagorean theorem, is fundamental to embedding space
    operations.
