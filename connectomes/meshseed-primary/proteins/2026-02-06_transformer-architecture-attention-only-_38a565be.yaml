title: 'Transformer Architecture: Attention-Only Sequence Transduction'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model abandons recurrence and convolution, relying solely on self-attention
  mechanisms to model global dependencies in sequence transduction tasks. This architecture allows
  for parallel computation and overcomes limitations of sequential processing in capturing
  long-range dependencies.
insights:
  - >-
    The Transformer is a novel sequence transduction model that entirely replaces recurrence and
    convolution with attention mechanisms.
  - >-
    Self-attention allows for modeling dependencies between any two positions in a sequence,
    regardless of their distance.
  - >-
    Previous non-recurrent models using convolution (Extended Neural GPU, ByteNet, ConvS2S) still
    faced challenges with learning distant dependencies due to linearly or logarithmically growing
    operations.
  - >-
    The Transformer's encoder-decoder structure, with stacked layers of multi-head self-attention
    and feed-forward networks, enables parallel processing.
  - >-
    Residual connections and layer normalization are employed within each encoder and decoder
    sub-layer to facilitate training.
