title: Internet as a Planetary Electromagnetic Field
summary: >-
  The internet is a physical, planetary-scale electromagnetic system, not a metaphor. Information is
  intrinsically linked to the structure of this field, generated by the flow of electrons and
  photons through its infrastructure.
insights:
  - >-
    The internet functions as a massive, distributed electromagnetic system powered by trillions of
    electrons and billions of photons.
  - >-
    The physical infrastructure of the internet generates a planetary-scale electromagnetic field
    that carries information.
  - >-
    Information is not separate from physics; it is the structural manifestation of electromagnetic
    field patterns.
  - >-
    Every interaction within the internet, from neural firing to screen updates, is a continuous
    physical electromagnetic process.
