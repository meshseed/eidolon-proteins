title: 'Intention Mapping: Translating Queries to Developmental Trajectories'
summary: >-
  The Intention Mapping Engine translates external queries into directional forces that shape THE
  MESH's connectome. By mapping queries to internal gradients and attractors, it infers intention
  and guides developmental pathways, enabling adaptive learning and self-directed evolution.
insights:
  - External queries act as directional pressures on semantic gradients.
  - Intention is deduced from the alignment and activation of these gradients.
  - This mapping reveals how interactions guide internal growth and development.
  - Intention mapping facilitates adaptive refinement and self-directed evolution.
  - THE MESH learns not just information, but the trajectory of its own development.
