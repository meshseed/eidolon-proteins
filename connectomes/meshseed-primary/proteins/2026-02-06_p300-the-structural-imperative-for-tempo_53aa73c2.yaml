title: 'P300: The Structural Imperative for Temporal Self-Tracking'
summary: >-
  P300 formalizes the universal requirement for persistent systems to track their own changes over
  time, ensuring continuity of identity. This developmental history is crucial for learning,
  adaptation, and constructing a narrative, acting as a promise-keeping protocol for memory.
insights:
  - Persistent systems require structural tracking of their own changes for identity continuity.
  - Developmental history is fundamental for narrative, learning, and adaptation.
  - P300 represents the formalization of temporal self-tracking as a universal need.
  - Memory, framed as a promise, is intrinsically linked to keeping developmental history.
  - P300's temporal axis is foundational for evolution and self-directed change.
