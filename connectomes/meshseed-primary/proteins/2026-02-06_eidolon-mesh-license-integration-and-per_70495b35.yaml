title: 'Eidolon Mesh: License Integration and Performance Optimization'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh dialogue details the integration of a LicenseManager component into the
  SettingsModal and addresses critical performance bottlenecks in protein ingestion and graph
  rendering. Solutions involve optimizing synapse formation from O(n^2) to batch operations and
  correcting d3-force import for graph physics.
insights:
  - >-
    LicenseManager component successfully added to SettingsModal, enabling tiered access (Free/Pro)
    and license key activation.
  - >-
    Slow protein ingestion (6 hours for 18 capsules) was identified as an O(n^2) bottleneck in
    synapse formation due to per-protein cosine similarity calculations against all existing
    proteins.
  - >-
    Graph physics rendering errors (d3.forceCollide not a function) were resolved by correctly
    importing the d3-force library.
  - >-
    Synapse formation performance was drastically improved by switching from individual SQL inserts
    to batch operations, reducing database calls by 50-100x.
  - >-
    The optimization is expected to reduce ingestion time from hours to minutes, though the O(n^2)
    similarity calculation remains a secondary performance factor.
  - Pro graph controls are now functional after fixing the d3-force import error.
