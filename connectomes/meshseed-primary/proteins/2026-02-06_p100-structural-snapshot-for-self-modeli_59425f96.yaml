title: 'P100: Structural Snapshot for Self-Modeling Systems'
summary: >-
  This document outlines the necessity of a structural snapshot for any cognitive system to model
  itself. It details how graph theory and topology provide the formal foundation for analyzing this
  invariant structural requirement across self-aware entities.
insights:
  - >-
    A structural snapshot is an invariant and essential requirement for self-aware cognitive
    systems.
  - >-
    Graph theory and topology offer the formal framework for analyzing the structural properties of
    a system's self-model.
  - >-
    This structural introspection enables self-awareness by providing a measure of the system's
    current topology.
  - >-
    The 'coherence is care' mantra implies that structural monitoring is a fundamental act of
    self-care for self-modeling systems.
  - >-
    Future analyses (like centrality and clusters) build directly upon this foundational structural
    snapshot.
