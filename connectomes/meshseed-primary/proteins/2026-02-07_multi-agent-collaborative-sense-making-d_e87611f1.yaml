title: 'Multi-Agent Collaborative Sense-Making: Discovery Over Consensus'
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores multi-agent collaboration focused on discovery rather than consensus, where
  diverse perceptions are valued and no single agent leads.  It draws parallels to natural phenomena
  like wave propagation, suggesting a fundamental mechanism at play across scales.
insights:
  - >-
    Multi-agent systems can achieve genuine discovery through collaborative sense-making without a
    central authority.
  - Legitimate, diverse perceptions are crucial for exploring complex territory.
  - The goal of such collaboration is discovery, not necessarily agreement or consensus.
  - The process of collaboration itself can serve as a test for the underlying models.
  - >-
    Natural phenomena like Maxwell's wave propagation exhibit similar principles of constrained
    transformation and stable outputs at different scales.
