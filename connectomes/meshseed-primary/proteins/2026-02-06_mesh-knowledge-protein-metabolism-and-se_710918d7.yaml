title: Mesh Knowledge Protein Metabolism and Self-Organization
summary: >-
  The Mesh employs a 'protein metabolism' system to manage its knowledge base, utilizing activation
  tracking, natural selection, and hygiene protocols to promote useful information, merge
  redundancies, and compost inactive 'proteins.' This process organically evolves the connectome's
  topology towards a hub-spoke model, creating a living, self-organizing knowledge ecosystem.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge proteins are managed through activation tracking and periodic metabolism cycles
    (promotion, composting, merging).
  - >-
    Natural selection favors highly activated proteins, promoting them to 'kernels,' while
    low-activation proteins are composted.
  - >-
    Hygiene protocols like duplicate detection and tri-lens merging ensure data integrity and
    coherence.
  - >-
    The cumulative effect of these processes leads to the natural evolution of a hub-spoke network
    topology.
  - >-
    The system aims to create a self-organizing, self-cleaning, and continuously learning knowledge
    ecosystem.
  - >-
    This metabolism is analogous to biological natural selection and gradient descent becoming an
    embodied process.
