title: Mobile Viewport Height Issues & UI Input Bar Visibility
summary: >-
  The core issue is mobile browsers' interpretation of '100vh' causing elements to be cut off,
  specifically hiding the chat input bar. Potential solutions involve '100dvh'/'100svh' or using
  `position: fixed` for main content, but past attempts and user feedback suggest complexity.
insights:
  - >-
    Mobile browsers (Chrome Android/Safari iOS) define '100vh' relative to the viewport *with* the
    URL bar retracted, leading to overflow when the bar is visible.
  - >-
    The chat input bar is hidden because it resides in an area of `.main-body` that is cut off by
    the viewport when '100vh' is too large.
  - >-
    Previous attempts to fix this using '100dvh'/'100svh' may have been rejected or poorly
    supported, or the reported 'graph missing' issue is unrelated.
  - >-
    Using `position: fixed; top: ...; bottom: ...;` for `.main-body` is an alternative to
    height-based sizing but can be complex with keyboard interactions.
  - >-
    The original problem might have been buttons hidden behind the bottom nav, and the current input
    bar hiding is a related but distinct manifestation of the viewport height issue.
  - >-
    Reverting recent height changes is a step, but a robust solution for input bar visibility on
    mobile is still needed.
