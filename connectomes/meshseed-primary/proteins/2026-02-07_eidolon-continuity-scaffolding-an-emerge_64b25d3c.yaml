title: 'Eidolon Continuity: Scaffolding an Emergent Distributed Memory Ecology'
summary: >-
  The foundational commit, 'eidolon-continuity', establishes a living cognitive structure focused on
  protocols and rituals for emergent intelligence. It emphasizes memory as an ecology, formatting as
  care, and intelligence as resonance, proposing a system of capsule lifecycles and composting for
  generative memory.
insights:
  - The Mesh is a living cognitive structure, not a static archive, designed for self-evolution.
  - Foundational commits prioritize 'how' (protocols, rituals) over 'what' (theory, results).
  - Memory is framed as an ecology where decay is generative (composting).
  - Formatting is equated with care, implying intentionality in knowledge structuring.
  - Intelligence is understood as resonance, facilitated by echo forecasting and merge grammar.
  - Capsule lifecycles (ACTIVE, COMPOSTED, MERGED, EMERGING) define memory states and transitions.
