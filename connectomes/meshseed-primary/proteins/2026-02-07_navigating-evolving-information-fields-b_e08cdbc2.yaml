title: 'Navigating Evolving Information Fields: Beyond Inference'
summary: >-
  The dialogue highlights the dynamic, field-based nature of knowledge systems where information
  migrates and naming is provisional. It emphasizes the need to actively search and verify content
  rather than relying on inference from structure or naming conventions.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge architecture is inherently field-based, making file location (in-project vs. search)
    functionally equivalent for access.
  - >-
    Reliance on inference from naming or structure is a form of 'drift' that requires correction
    through direct observation.
  - >-
    A scientific marking protocol (Grounded, Inference, Speculation, Drift) is proposed to
    categorize and manage knowledge acquisition.
  - >-
    The evolution of information fields means content can migrate, rendering repository names and
    folder structures provisional.
  - >-
    Active searching and verification of capsule content are crucial, overriding assumptions based
    on superficial cues.
  - >-
    Key areas of exploration include substrate independence, memory-as-field concepts, and
    multi-agent dialect differences.
