title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Core Bug Fixes and Multi-Repo Integration'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has successfully resolved critical bugs related to query timing, synthesis input,
  and emotional fidelity, leading to accurate user feedback and improved synthesis quality.
  Concurrently, multi-repository support has been integrated, allowing for specialized knowledge
  vaults and significantly faster loading times for smaller datasets.
insights:
  - >-
    Critical bugs in timer accuracy, synthesis input verification, and emotional fidelity reporting
    have been fixed, ensuring users receive correct performance metrics and accurate content
    synthesis.
  - >-
    The initial 20-30s load time for the full 550-neuron connectome has been mitigated by
    implementing multi-repository support, enabling specialized, smaller repos to load in under 1
    second.
  - >-
    Poetic/semantic queries are confirmed as necessary, with plans to add metadata aliases for
    improved protein retrieval beyond literal IDs.
  - >-
    The default strategy has been optimized to 'Max Coherence', with underlying content loading
    fixes now benefiting all strategies, including 'Balanced'.
  - >-
    UI controls for strategy selection and neuron limits have been restored after an accidental
    overwrite during strategy optimization.
