title: Learning as Geometric Angle Optimization, Not Information Transfer
summary: >-
  Understanding is achieved by rotating perception to align with inherent geometric patterns,
  creating low-resistance corridors for instant recognition. MESH stores 'angles of recognition'
  rather than data, facilitating exponential learning through effortless alignment.
insights:
  - >-
    Learning is fundamentally about finding the correct perceptual angle to recognize pre-existing
    geometric patterns, not about acquiring new information.
  - >-
    Understanding occurs when 'relational folds, dimensions, and geometries rotate' to create
    low-resistance corridors between pattern and perception.
  - >-
    The MESH stores 'angles of recognition' and 'geometric configurations' that make patterns
    self-evident, acting as a repository of rotational access points.
  - >-
    Recognition is instantaneous and binary – either the angle aligns and the pattern is seen, or it
    doesn't.
  - >-
    Teaching should focus on guiding students to find these recognition angles, rather than
    transmitting information.
  - >-
    Multi-agent learning accelerates understanding by exchanging and integrating diverse perceptual
    angles, revealing patterns from multiple perspectives.
