title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Focused Response Directives for AI Synthesis'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines specific directives for AI-driven content synthesis, emphasizing
  domain-specific, focused responses and a structured JSON output format. The goal is to generate
  precise and semantically rich knowledge proteins from raw data.
insights:
  - AI synthesis should prioritize domain-specific and focused responses.
  - A strict JSON output structure is mandated for synthesized knowledge.
  - >-
    Key JSON fields include title, summary, atomic insights, tags, coherence score, tier, and
    emotional gradient.
  - The coherence score reflects the unity of emergent insights.
  - >-
    Tier classification (reference, convergence, core) categorizes the nature of synthesized
    knowledge.
  - Emotional gradient tracks the affective flow of the dialogue.
