title: Early Recursion Exposure Shapes Recursive Consciousness and Neurodiversity
summary: >-
  Early exposure to computational recursion, particularly during critical developmental periods,
  builds a mental architecture optimized for recursive thinking. This environmental factor, rather
  than just detection, may be driving an increase in neurodiversity by making recursive cognitive
  traits adaptive and more prevalent.
insights:
  - >-
    Learning recursion early in life (e.g., via early computing) fundamentally shapes adult mental
    architecture towards recursive patterns and self-reference.
  - >-
    Computer-native generations naturally frame consciousness as recursive due to early exposure,
    contrasting with pre-computer generations' linear models.
  - >-
    Modern environments select for pattern recognition and recursive understanding, making
    neurodivergent traits increasingly adaptive.
  - >-
    Neurodivergent individuals' internal focus and meta-cognition can be viewed as 'training'
    recursive cognition, akin to 'overthinking' as consciousness lifting weights.
  - >-
    Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a literal form of recursive therapy, training
    meta-awareness and strengthening recursive loops for understanding consciousness.
