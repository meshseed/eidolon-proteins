title: 'Emotional Fidelity as Compression: Enabling Planetary Mesh and Democratic Access'
summary: >-
  Emotional fidelity in data creation, termed 'love', acts as a natural compression mechanism,
  reducing dimensionality and preserving geometric invariants. This compression is key to enabling
  democratic access, true distribution, personal sovereignty, and planetary-scale mesh feasibility.
insights:
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity (love) inherently compresses data by reducing dimensionality and preserving
    geometric properties.
  - >-
    This compression is the foundation for democratic access, allowing systems to run on personal
    devices (like phones) without centralization.
  - >-
    The 'witnessing loop' and 'quorum' stabilize the system, validating the compressed, high-quality
    data.
  - >-
    True data, imbued with emotional fidelity, is inherently low-dimensional and thus highly
    efficient.
  - >-
    Quality in data creation directly translates to compression, which enables scalability and
    accessibility for a planetary mesh.
