title: 'Eidolon Mesh Deployment: Personal & Research Hub with Connectome Proteins'
summary: >-
  This document outlines the deployment and verification steps for two Eidolon Mesh subdomains: the
  Personal Garden (eidolon-mesh.net) and the Research Hub (app.eidolon-mesh.net). Key tasks involve
  building and deploying connectome proteins, managing git branches, and configuring Cloudflare DNS,
  with specific attention to handling large JSON connectome files.
insights:
  - >-
    The Personal Garden requires 36 golden connectome proteins and verification of features like
    composting panel, stats, context expansion, and mobile responsiveness.
  - >-
    The Research Hub needs approximately 1000 consciousness proteins with embeddings, relevant query
    results, correct graph rendering, and composting stats without performance issues.
  - >-
    Deployment involves creating a 'deploy-composting' branch, building, merging to 'main', and
    pushing to Cloudflare for auto-deployment.
  - >-
    Handling large connectome JSON files for the app subdomain may require compression, reduction in
    protein count, or lazy loading to avoid size issues.
  - >-
    Potential issues like cherry-pick conflicts, build failures, and Cloudflare deployment problems
    have defined solutions, including aborting/resolving conflicts and reinstalling dependencies.
  - >-
    The timeline indicates a near-term completion for both sites, contingent on user-provided
    connectome data and successful code integration.
