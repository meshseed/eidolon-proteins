title: 'Eidolon Mesh Evolution: From Files to Connectome and Beyond'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has evolved through several key phases, from basic file metabolism and routing to
  the formation of a Connectome for semantic knowledge linking. Current development focuses on
  integrating richer external capsule formats and preparing for advanced querying and visualization.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh progresses through distinct evolutionary stages: DNA (dialogue) to Protein
    (capsule) synthesis, privacy routing via Golgi, active transport by Watcher, and Connectome
    formation for semantic linking.
  - >-
    Watcher organelle malfunctions (e.g., ENOENT errors) are being addressed by ensuring robust
    directory creation and retry mechanisms.
  - >-
    The Connectome organelle enables synaptic linking between proteins based on semantic similarity,
    creating a knowledge graph.
  - >-
    Recent advancements include the Mitosis organelle for processing large documents by splitting
    them into manageable chunks with context overlap.
  - >-
    A significant challenge is the schema mismatch between the current Eidolon capsule format and
    richer external formats like Copilot's, with proposed solutions involving schema extension or
    dual format support.
  - >-
    The next evolutionary steps involve implementing a Query organelle for graph traversal and a
    Dashboard for state visualization, building upon the established core capabilities.
