title: 'Curvature Diagnostics: Identifying Synthesis Pressure Points'
summary: >-
  P600 Curvature Diagnostics protocol identifies high-curvature regions as indicators of conceptual
  tension and synthesis pressure. These zones, arising from gradient interference and attractor
  overlap, signal where integration and targeted refinement are needed.
insights:
  - High curvature in conceptual space signifies areas of conceptual tension and required synthesis.
  - >-
    Curvature emerges from the intersection of multiple semantic directions, including gradient
    interference and attractor overlap.
  - >-
    Boundary surfaces identified by curvature mark where different domains meet and necessitate
    integration.
  - >-
    Curvature diagnostics enable targeted refinement by pinpointing zones of pressure and potential
    growth.
  - These diagnostic maps are dynamic and evolve with the ingestion of new information.
