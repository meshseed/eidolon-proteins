title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Euclidean Geometry''s Right Triangle Foundation'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean Theorem (a² + b² = c²) defines the fundamental relationship between the sides of a
  right triangle in Euclidean geometry. It serves as a foundational element for distance
  calculations, spatial reasoning, and connects algebraic and geometric principles.
insights:
  - Defines the relationship between legs (a, b) and hypotenuse (c) in right triangles.
  - Applicable only to Euclidean (flat) geometry and requires a 90-degree angle.
  - Forms the basis for the Euclidean distance formula in 2D and higher dimensions.
  - Illustrates integer solutions through Pythagorean triples (e.g., 3,4,5).
  - Connects algebra and geometry, acting as a universal calibration anchor.
