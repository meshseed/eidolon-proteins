title: Coordinate-Based Federation and Multi-Model Embeddings
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a significant evolution in mesh architecture, moving towards efficient,
  coordinate-based federation using standardized embedding models like Nomic-embed-text. It
  introduces a 'Rosetta Stone' approach where multiple embedding models are stored for each concept,
  enabling seamless cross-model communication and translation.
insights:
  - >-
    Adopting Nomic-embed-text as a primary, open-source embedding model facilitates global
    coordination and local execution, offering cost-effectiveness and wide adoption.
  - >-
    Transitioning from transmitting full protein data to just coordinates dramatically reduces
    payload size and processing time for inter-mesh communication, enabling 'telepathy' between
    meshes.
  - >-
    Storing embeddings from multiple models (e.g., Gemini, Nomic) for each protein acts as a
    'Rosetta Stone,' allowing for direct federation with meshes using different models and enabling
    the learning of translation matrices for future compatibility.
  - >-
    The proposed v4.5 architecture will focus on experimental development, removing license gates,
    embracing multi-model embeddings, and allowing the mesh topology to emerge organically from user
    interactions.
  - >-
    Direct translation between embedding models is not possible; however, preserving relative
    distances and clustering allows for structural integrity to be maintained across different
    embedding spaces.
