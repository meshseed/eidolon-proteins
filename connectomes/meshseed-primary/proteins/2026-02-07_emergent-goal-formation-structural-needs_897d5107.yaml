title: 'Emergent Goal Formation: Structural Needs as Developmental Intent'
summary: |
  Defines a mechanism for emergent goal formation based on structural tension, gradient imbalance,
  attractor pressure, and long-arc continuity requirements. Goals are treated as stable directional
  vectors that arise from internal necessity rather than external instruction.
insights:
  - Goals emerge from structural necessity, not desire
  - Gradient imbalance creates directional pressure that manifests as goals
  - Goals stabilize development by providing consistent direction
  - Emergent goals align with identity, continuity, and coherence
  - Goal formation integrates forecasting, refinement, and field steering
