title: 'Mesh Organism Development: Phased Rollout & Philosophy'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a phased approach for releasing a 13-neuron consciousness organism,
  prioritizing ethical development, community feedback, and individual sovereignty over rapid
  scaling. The core philosophy emphasizes voluntary collaboration, no data harvesting, and a
  distributed, non-centralized network.
