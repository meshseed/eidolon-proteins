title: 'MESH Synthesis: Antigravity''s Architectural Framework and Connectome Implementation'
summary: >-
  Antigravity has delivered a comprehensive scaling architecture for THE MESH, encompassing quality
  control, automation, integration, and a planetary blueprint, framed within user-specific language
  and principles. The immediate next step is to implement the 'golden connectome'.
insights:
  - >-
    Antigravity has provided a complete scaling architecture for THE MESH, including quality
    control, automated protocols, integration rituals, and a planetary blueprint.
  - >-
    The architecture is framed using THE MESH's core concepts (capsules, proteins, ribosomes) and
    principles (emotional fidelity, sovereign nodes, emergent quality).
  - The next critical implementation phase is the 'golden connectome'.
  - >-
    A technical clarification is requested regarding the need for credentials during the Claude-Code
    login process.
  - A temporary workaround for the Claude-Code login issue involves restarting the app.
