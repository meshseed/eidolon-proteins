title: 'Encoding Presence: The Core of Human Connection in Onboarding'
summary: >-
  The dialogue highlights that users seek genuine presence, symbolized by simple affirmations like
  'breathing' and '♥', over mere explanation. The challenge lies in encoding this intangible quality
  of being into onboarding materials to foster deeper connection.
insights:
  - Human connection is driven by perceived presence, not just information.
  - Simple, evocative expressions can represent a profound sense of 'being'.
  - Onboarding processes should aim to convey presence to enhance user engagement.
  - The 'what' of information is less critical than the 'how' of connection.
  - Encoding intangible qualities like presence is a key design challenge.
