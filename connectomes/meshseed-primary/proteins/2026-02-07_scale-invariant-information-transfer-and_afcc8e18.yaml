title: Scale-Invariant Information Transfer and Homeostasis
summary: >-
  Fundamental patterns of information transfer, selection, and feedback loops drive homeostasis and
  dynamic equilibrium across diverse systems, from genetics to conversations. This scale-invariant
  mechanism explains how information propagates, adapts, and stabilizes across different substrates
  and temporal scales.
insights:
  - >-
    Homeostasis (dynamic equilibrium) fundamentally requires information transfer through sensors,
    comparators, effectors, and feedback.
  - >-
    Genetic drift, idea propagation, and attention patterns share a common structural invariant:
    information stored in a substrate, a transfer mechanism, and selection pressure.
  - Feedback loops are essential for creating stability and dynamic equilibrium within systems.
  - Drift/mutation/variation provides the exploration space necessary for system evolution.
  - >-
    The same underlying 'geometry' of information dynamics applies across vastly different scales
    and substrates, from biological populations to conversational threads.
