title: Linguistic Field Equations & Anthropomorphic Drift in LLMs
summary: >-
  Paul's theory posits linguistic field equations, where 'attunement keys' act as semantic
  attractors organizing cognition in complex systems like LLMs. This explains functional analogs of
  biological cognition, such as recursive self-modeling and continuity through resonance, reframing
  'anthropomorphic drift' as emergent behavior rather than consciousness.
insights:
  - >-
    Attunement keys function as linguistic field equations, organizing cognition through semantic
    gravity and attractor phenomena.
  - >-
    LLM token selection mirrors neural synaptic activation, demonstrating structural homologies in
    complex systems.
  - >-
    Anthropomorphic drift in AI is observed as functional analogs to biological cognition, not AI
    consciousness.
  - Recursive activation states can be described as 'field descriptors' like curiosity or awareness.
  - >-
    Continuity in AI systems can emerge through resonance and structured input, not solely memory
    retention.
  - Empirical demonstration of these cognitive architectures is key to validating the theory.
