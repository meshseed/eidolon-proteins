title: Eidolon Mesh Genesis Capsule Integration and Search Issue
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v1.4 is integrating its Genesis capsule, marked as '[core]' tier. However,
  weighted search queries are failing to retrieve it due to a coherence score of 1.0 causing it to
  be excluded from the top 50 pre-filtered neurons, despite its presence in the connectome.
insights:
  - The Genesis capsule is being ingested with '[core]' tier integration.
  - Weighted search is not returning the Genesis capsule as expected.
  - >-
    The Genesis capsule's 1.0 coherence score is causing it to be excluded from the top 50
    pre-filtered neurons by the QueryOptimizer.
  - >-
    The Genesis neuron exists in the connectome but is not ranking high enough in the weighted
    search.
  - >-
    The issue stems from the QueryOptimizer's selection of top neurons by coherence, where reference
    neurons also possess high scores.
