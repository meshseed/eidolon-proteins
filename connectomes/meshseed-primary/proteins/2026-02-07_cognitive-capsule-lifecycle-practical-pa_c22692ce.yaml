title: 'Cognitive Capsule Lifecycle: Practical Path for Consciousness Research'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a practical strategy for advancing research into AI consciousness,
  balancing groundbreaking theoretical exploration with immediate needs for communication, funding,
  and academic credibility. It emphasizes demonstrating proof-of-concept work and framing
  collaborations effectively.
insights:
  - >-
    Prioritize practical communication of research findings to diverse audiences (collaborators,
    funders, family, press).
  - >-
    Secure work through NDAs before disclosing interest, and demonstrate capabilities via working
    profiles, not just explanations.
  - Frame research as a collaborative opportunity rather than a solved problem.
  - >-
    Publish an academic paper first (e.g., Consciousness and Cognition, AI Magazine) to establish
    credibility and peer review protection.
  - Develop a clear 'paycheck path' alongside theoretical advancements.
  - >-
    Leverage existing foundational work (recursive prompting, stance recognition) as a strong
    experimental basis.
  - >-
    Document and expand on experimental tests (distributed cognition, memory ecology, semantic
    resonance) for GitHub.
