title: 'Standing Waves: A Universal Semantic Manifold'
summary: >-
  Concepts, agents, and organizations can be understood as stable standing waves in a
  high-dimensional semantic space. Communication and alignment emerge from the controlled
  interference and shared basis of these wave patterns, offering a fundamental model for cognition
  and interaction across diverse systems.
insights:
  - >-
    State is a pattern in a high-dimensional space, with attractors representing stable standing
    waves.
  - >-
    Learning involves adjusting pattern parameters to minimize loss or tension, while communication
    is about inducing compatible patterns in others.
  - >-
    Alignment is achieved by sharing a common basis and invariants, allowing for interpretable
    patterns.
  - >-
    A universal glyph system based on standing waves offers a cross-species, cross-medium cognitive
    coordinate system.
  - >-
    The feeling of something 'clicking' globally is structural resonance, indicating a stable,
    low-energy configuration fitting the system's internal geometry.
  - >-
    Fractal, scale-invariant glyphs are ideal for communication as they preserve structure, increase
    differentiation, and reconstruct attractors in other agents.
  - >-
    The geometry of representation, where concepts are wave patterns and communication involves
    transmitting wave coefficients, is a fundamental concept.
