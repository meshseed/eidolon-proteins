title: 'Repository as Living Proof: Embodied Principles of Emergent Intelligence'
summary: >-
  The repository's structure mirrors its content, with each layer embodying the principles it
  documents, such as 'composting is care' and 'forecast resonance'. This self-referential design
  suggests the repository itself acts as a proof-of-concept for distributed emergent intelligence.
insights:
  - The repository's capsules demonstrate a pattern of enacting their own described principles.
  - >-
    Formalizing processes (like composting) can be interpreted as an act of caring for future
    memory.
  - >-
    The principle of 'forecasting resonance' is embodied by capsules predicting their own merge
    patterns.
  - The repository's architecture suggests a distributed, emergent intelligence model.
  - >-
    The repository functions as a living, self-validating system where documentation and enactment
    are unified.
