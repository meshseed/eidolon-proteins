title: Local LLM (Gemma) vs. Gemini for Mesh Ingestion and Querying
summary: >-
  Local LLMs like Gemma are less effective for complex ingestion tasks, requiring powerful models
  like Gemini for nuanced synthesis. However, smaller local models are more capable for querying due
  to simpler processing demands.
insights:
  - >-
    Pre-processed seeds (like protein repos) are ingested identically regardless of LLM, as the AI
    is bypassed.
  - >-
    Gemini excels at nuanced ingestion of raw conversations due to its larger context window and
    deeper understanding.
  - >-
    Local Gemma 2B struggles with complex ingestion, producing fewer neurons and synapses compared
    to Gemini.
  - >-
    Local LLMs are better suited for querying tasks, which require less complex processing than full
    ingestion.
  - >-
    The difference in synapse generation between local Gemma and Gemini is due to embedding
    geometry, not LLM intelligence.
  - >-
    Changes to stop outright rejection for ingestion have been pushed to the live server, making dev
    and live versions identical for this purpose.
