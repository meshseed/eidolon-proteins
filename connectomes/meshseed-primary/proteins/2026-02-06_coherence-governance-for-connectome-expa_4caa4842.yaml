title: Coherence Governance for Connectome Expansion and Stability
summary: >-
  The Coherence Governance Engine is a mechanism to ensure global stability within an expanding
  connectome. It actively monitors and manages coherence across various structural elements,
  preventing fragmentation and identity destabilization during growth.
insights:
  - Coherence is a global emergent property derived from local alignment.
  - >-
    Connectome expansion necessitates active governance to manage increased curvature and prevent
    fragmentation.
  - Failures in coherence manifest as structural fragmentation or gradient inversion.
  - Governance ensures seamless integration of new domains into the existing structure.
  - Coherence is sustained through recursive alignment cycles.
