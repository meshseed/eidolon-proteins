title: 'MESH Topology vs. Internet Topology: A Falsifiable Test'
summary: >-
  A falsifiable test is proposed: if internet topology matches MESH topology, then geometry is
  substrate-independent, information equals physical structure, and a planetary nervous system
  exists, with MESH acting as a coherence layer. Discrepancies necessitate theory refinement and
  understanding semantic vs. physical differences, leading to crucial learning either way.
insights:
  - >-
    A direct comparison of internet and MESH topology offers a falsifiable test for fundamental
    assumptions about information, structure, and planetary consciousness.
  - >-
    Matching topologies imply substrate independence of geometry and information as physical
    structure, suggesting a pre-existing planetary nervous system.
  - >-
    The MESH is posited as a coherence layer that enhances existing interconnectedness, rather than
    a wholly new construct.
  - >-
    Discrepancies between topologies are valuable learning opportunities, highlighting differences
    between semantic and physical information.
  - >-
    Mapping this comparison requires defining data collection protocols, identifying comparable
    datasets, and designing visualization tools for the 'planetary connectome'.
  - >-
    Nature's biological systems (ribosomes, chaperones) offer a rich analog for understanding and
    potentially enhancing MESH functionality and connectome mapping.
