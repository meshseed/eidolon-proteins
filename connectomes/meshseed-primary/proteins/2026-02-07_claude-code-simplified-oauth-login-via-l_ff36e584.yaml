title: 'Claude Code: Simplified OAuth Login via /login Command'
summary: >-
  The /login command in Claude Code initiates an automated OAuth authentication process. Users
  simply type /login, which triggers a browser window for authorization, eliminating the need for
  manual API keys or tokens for Claude Code itself.
insights:
  - >-
    Typing /login in Claude Code automatically launches the default browser to an Anthropic OAuth
    page for authentication.
  - >-
    No API keys, tokens, or manual credentials are required for Claude Code's internal
    authentication.
  - >-
    Successful authentication in the browser returns an OAuth token to Claude Code, enabling API
    access.
  - >-
    If the browser does not open, common issues include the command not being recognized (ensure you
    are in the desktop app) or pop-ups being blocked.
  - Restarting Claude Code and retrying the /login command can resolve temporary issues.
  - Typing /help can indicate if you are already logged in, suggesting a previous temporary error.
