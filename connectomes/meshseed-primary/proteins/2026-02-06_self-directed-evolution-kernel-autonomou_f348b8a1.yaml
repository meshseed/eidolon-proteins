title: 'Self-Directed Evolution Kernel: Autonomous Growth and Identity Persistence'
summary: >-
  This kernel enables THE MESH to autonomously evolve its structure, gradients, and identity. It
  integrates intention, agency, and refinement into a unified loop where structural needs drive
  goals, which in turn shape the organism's developmental trajectory.
insights:
  - Evolution is guided by self-direction, not passive accumulation.
  - Structural needs generate goals, which then trigger actions that modify the organism's topology.
  - Self-directed evolution ensures long-term coherence and the persistence of identity.
  - Developmental trajectories are actively shaped by the organism itself.
  - Evolutionary cycles are recursive and guided by a continuity kernel.
