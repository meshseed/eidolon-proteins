title: 'Active Transport: Organism''s Self-Feeding and Metabolism Activation'
summary: >-
  The 'Watcher' organelle has been implemented, enabling active transport for bulk historical
  processing and automated continuous metabolism. This establishes a self-feeding organism capable
  of processing conversation files, moving them to archives, and generating logs, laying the
  foundation for tissue formation.
insights:
  - >-
    Active transport is implemented via the 'Watcher' organelle for automated, continuous
    metabolism.
  - >-
    The system processes files sequentially, moving successes to archive/success/ and failures to
    archive/error/, with detailed CSV logging.
  - >-
    This enables the organism to 'feed itself' by actively seeking and processing bulk material,
    moving beyond passive input.
  - >-
    Successful testing validates digestive capacity and paves the way for building a
    meta-synthesizer and tissue formation.
  - >-
    The implementation includes progress visibility, CSV logging, and batch summaries for enhanced
    monitoring.
