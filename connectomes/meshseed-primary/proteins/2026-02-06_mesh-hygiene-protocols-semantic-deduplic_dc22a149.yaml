title: 'MESH Hygiene Protocols: Semantic Deduplication & Integration'
summary: >-
  The MESH employs advanced hygiene protocols for protein management, including semantic
  deduplication to identify and merge similar knowledge proteins. This process is guided by user
  oversight, allowing for the import of diverse connectomes and the observation of 'natural
  selection' among knowledge structures.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH system actively detects and suggests merging of semantically similar knowledge proteins
    (e.g., 'Universal Gradient Descent').
  - >-
    Capsule Hygiene Protocols offer automated actions like merging, composting inactive proteins,
    and promoting emergent kernels.
  - >-
    A 'Natural Selection Import Flow' allows importing connectomes in an 'isolate' mode, deferring
    integration to hygiene protocols for controlled evolution.
  - >-
    User-guided deduplication and import strategies enable a curated, emergent ecosystem of
    knowledge proteins within THE MESH.
  - >-
    The system tracks protein lineage, providing visibility into the evolution of knowledge
    structures.
