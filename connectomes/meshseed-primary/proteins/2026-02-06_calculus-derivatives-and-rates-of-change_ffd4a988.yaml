title: 'Calculus: Derivatives and Rates of Change'
summary: >-
  The derivative quantifies the instantaneous rate of change of a function, representing the slope
  of its tangent line. It's defined by a limit and governed by fundamental rules like the power,
  sum, product, and chain rules. Calculus connects differentiation and integration as inverse
  operations, revealing continuous change and enabling optimization.
insights:
  - The derivative measures instantaneous change, akin to a function's velocity.
  - Geometric interpretation of the derivative is the slope of the tangent line.
  - Fundamental rules (power, sum, product, chain) provide the mechanics for differentiation.
  - Derivatives are key to optimization problems by identifying points of zero change.
  - The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus links differentiation and integration as inverse processes.
