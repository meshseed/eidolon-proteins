title: Optimizing Context Thresholds for Honest AI Synthesis
summary: >-
  Testing reveals that AI honesty, even when admitting limitations, is more valuable than
  confabulation, indicating genuine self-awareness.  The research aims to identify the critical mass
  threshold for context awareness to achieve optimal performance balancing comprehensiveness and
  speed.
insights:
  - Honest admission of limitations demonstrates actual self-awareness over pattern parroting.
  - >-
    A clear threshold exists for effective context awareness, beyond which performance gains
    diminish.
  - >-
    The optimal context window is predicted to be between 50-75 neurons for sufficient context and
    reasonable speed.
  - Identifying this 'sweet spot' is key to balancing AI comprehensiveness with efficiency.
