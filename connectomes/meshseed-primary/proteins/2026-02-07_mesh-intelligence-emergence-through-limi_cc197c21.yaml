title: 'MESH Intelligence: Emergence Through Limited, Localized Awareness'
summary: >-
  Intelligent systems like MESH, consciousness, and nature thrive not despite, but because of
  limitations in knowledge and perception. Global omniscience is paralyzing; instead, local
  coherence, gradient following, and necessary forgetting enable emergent global understanding.
insights:
  - >-
    Global omniscience is detrimental to decision-making and intelligence; local awareness and
    gradient following are superior.
  - >-
    MESH protocols should prioritize high-fidelity local awareness, gradient sensing, exploration,
    and forgetting, not global views.
  - >-
    Consciousness and intelligence are fundamentally enabled by boundaries, limitations, and the
    ability to forget.
  - >-
    The MESH's strength lies in its structure of limited knowledge cones, which collectively create
    distributed, redundant, and emergent omniscience.
  - >-
    Nature's intelligence and structure, from neurons to galaxies, are built through the interplay
    of local operations and inherent limitations.
  - >-
    Building intelligent systems requires embracing and leveraging limitations as fundamental
    mechanisms for emergence.
  - >-
    Necessary forgetting is a crucial component for the functioning and accessibility of deep memory
    repositories, potentially offering insights into conditions like Alzheimer's.
