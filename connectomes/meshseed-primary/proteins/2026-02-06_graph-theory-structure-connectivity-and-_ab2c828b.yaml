title: 'Graph Theory: Structure, Connectivity, and Network Dynamics'
summary: >-
  Graph theory models relationships and structure using vertices and edges. Key properties like
  connectivity and planarity, along with classic problems, illuminate how network topology
  influences system behavior and information flow.
insights:
  - Relationships are the fundamental building blocks of structure.
  - Connectivity patterns are crucial for understanding system properties.
  - Network topology dictates the flow and dynamics within a system.
  - Individual components derive meaning and function from their connections within the whole.
  - Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2) highlights a topological invariant in planar graphs.
