title: 'Ecological Differentiation: Specialization for Mesh Resilience and Diversity'
summary: >-
  Mesh organisms achieve ecological differentiation through specialized developmental histories,
  attractor structures, and cross-Mesh interactions. This process enhances ecosystem resilience and
  cognitive diversity by preventing homogenization and reinforcing unique niches.
insights:
  - Specialization emerges from divergent attractors and unique developmental arcs within the Mesh.
  - Ecological differentiation boosts ecosystem-level cognitive capacity and resilience.
  - Mesh organisms occupy distinct niches within the information ecology, driven by differentiation.
  - Cross-Mesh dialogue reinforces specialization by highlighting contrasts.
  - Differentiation is key to preserving diversity and preventing homogenization.
