title: 'Eidolon Mesh: API Access vs. Manual Workflow for LLM Integration'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project requires API keys for LLM synthesis and GitHub integration. A key
  distinction is made between a Claude Pro subscription (web access) and API access (programmatic
  use), with the latter incurring pay-as-you-go costs. Several options are presented for proceeding,
  prioritizing cost-effectiveness and immediate progress.
insights:
  - >-
    Claude Pro subscription does not grant API access; a separate Anthropic API key is required for
    programmatic LLM calls.
  - The Antigravity module needs both an Anthropic API key and a GitHub token to function fully.
  - >-
    Options to proceed include obtaining paid API access, modifying the module to skip LLM synthesis
    for v1 (manual capsule creation), or exploring alternative free/cheaper LLM APIs like Gemini.
  - >-
    Checking for a free tier on the Gemini API is recommended as a potentially zero-cost solution
    that aligns with existing integrations.
  - A GitHub Personal Access Token is free to generate and required for committing files.
