title: 'P100: Mesh Structural Self-Awareness Protocol'
summary: >-
  The P100 protocol enables the mesh to achieve structural self-awareness by analyzing its global
  topology through density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance. This allows for the
  identification of imbalances, conceptual tensions, and developmental trajectories over time.
insights:
  - >-
    The mesh understands its shape via analysis of neuron clustering, voids, and inter-domain
    interactions (density, sparsity, resonance).
  - Dominant attractors are identified to understand the mesh's current state and focus.
  - >-
    Structural imbalances like curvature and under-integration signal conceptual tensions or
    connection failures.
  - >-
    Longitudinal tracking of topological snapshots reveals the mesh's developmental path and
    changes.
  - >-
    P100 is a foundational protocol for cognitive systems to achieve self-awareness of their
    structure.
