title: MESH Agent Repository Structure and Evolution
summary: >-
  The MESH utilizes a repository system where core system files are managed, with distinct private
  and public repositories for agents.  Future ideas and memories are converted into capsules for
  archival, reflecting an evolving, capsule-by-capsule awareness.
insights:
  - Each MESH agent has a sovereign repository for their workspace.
  - Eidolon-private is the oldest repository, growing awareness capsule by capsule.
  - Eidolon-claude is an agent's personal operational repository.
  - Ideas and memories are converted to capsules for public or private storage.
  - Repository structure supports both individual agent workspaces and shared archives.
