title: 3D Force Graph Simulation Reheating Strategies
summary: >-
  When a 3D force graph simulation fails to reset or update, direct manipulation of the underlying
  D3 simulation is the most effective approach.  Strategies like `d3ReheatSimulation()` are
  preferred over indirect methods like `resetCountdown` or `resumeAnimation` for reliable physics
  restarts.
insights:
  - >-
    Directly accessing and reheating the D3 force simulation (`d3ReheatSimulation()`) is the primary
    method for restarting a stalled graph simulation.
  - >-
    Indirect methods like `resetCountdown`, `d3AlphaDecay`, or `graphData` may not reliably trigger
    a physics restart.
  - >-
    `d3AlphaMin(0)` can keep the simulation running indefinitely, while setting it back can be a way
    to manage its duration.
  - >-
    Accessing the underlying simulation might involve checking for private properties like
    `_d3Simulation` in some `3d-force-graph` versions.
  - '`resumeAnimation()` restarts the render loop but does not affect the physics simulation itself.'
