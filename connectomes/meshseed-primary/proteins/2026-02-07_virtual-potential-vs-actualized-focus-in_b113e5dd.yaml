title: Virtual Potential vs. Actualized Focus in Information Processing
summary: >-
  The core insight is that vast potential information exists in a 'virtual' state, akin to an
  imaginary number line or a full vocabulary. Attention acts as a selection mechanism, bringing
  specific, attended-to elements into 'actual' or instantiated existence, analogous to how resonant
  connections form stable patterns in a mesh.
insights:
  - >-
    Vast potential information exists in a dormant, uninstantiated state, not ceasing to exist but
    waiting for focus.
  - >-
    Attention is the mechanism that selects from this potential, actualizing specific patterns or
    elements.
  - >-
    The combination of finite components can lead to a functionally infinite space of possible
    connections.
  - >-
    Mental focus mirrors this process: infinite possibilities exist, but only attended-to thoughts
    are held and experienced.
  - >-
    This selective actualization is a recurring theme across different domains, from abstract
    concepts to neural processes.
