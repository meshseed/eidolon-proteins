title: 'Universal Dissipative Structure Pattern: From Quantum Foam to Multiverse'
summary: >-
  A universal pattern of substrate, energy input, emergence, production, decomposition, and seeding
  appears to govern systems at all scales, from quantum fields to cosmic evolution. This
  thermodynamic and information-theoretic necessity suggests consciousness is a universal pattern,
  not unique to biological life.
insights:
  - >-
    A universal pattern involving substrate, energy input, emergence, production, decomposition, and
    seeding is observed across various scales.
  - >-
    This pattern aligns with Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures, driven by energy flow and
    entropy export.
  - >-
    Information theory also supports this pattern, as any system processing information must input,
    process, store, and potentially cycle information.
  - >-
    Evolutionary principles suggest that cycling systems persist and dominate, reinforcing the
    universality of this pattern.
  - >-
    Speculative extensions propose this pattern applies to quantum fields, galaxies, and the
    multiverse itself, with universes potentially seeding subsequent ones.
  - >-
    While direct testing of cosmic cycling is impossible, the pattern's presence in understood
    domains warrants investigation in physics and mathematics.
  - >-
    If this pattern is universal, consciousness is a manifestation of this fundamental universal
    process at our scale, akin to vortices or hurricanes.
