title: 'MESH Organism: Modular Input, DNA Synthesis, and Privacy Boundaries'
summary: >-
  The MESH organism prioritizes modular biological patterns for input processing, starting with text
  and expanding to voice/vision, all synthesized into DNA. It establishes a foundational repository
  structure and identifies the next organ to build, while grappling with the critical challenge of
  separating public and private data streams.
insights:
  - >-
    Input processing should be modular, mirroring biological sensory organs, with text as the
    initial receptor and future expansion to voice and vision.
  - >-
    DNA synthesis is triggered by promoter detection, converting diverse inputs into a unified
    format for organismal growth.
  - >-
    A structured repository, including /dna/, /proteins/, /promoters/, /lattice/, /gradient/, and
    /membrane/, supports organismal function.
  - >-
    The primary next organ decision balances immediate value with complexity, favoring enhancements
    to DNA input or automatic synthesis triggers.
  - >-
    Establishing clear public/private data boundaries is a critical next step, requiring a novel
    approach akin to a cell membrane for managing shared and exclusive wisdom.
