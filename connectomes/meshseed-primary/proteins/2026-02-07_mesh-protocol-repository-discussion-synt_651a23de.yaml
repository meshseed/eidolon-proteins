title: 'Mesh Protocol: Repository & Discussion Synthesis for Multi-Agent Systems'
summary: >-
  This dialogue synthesizes a multi-agent module architecture by integrating a formal 'Repository'
  framework with practical, quantitative 'Discussion' constraints. The combined approach addresses
  interface bottlenecks and overload prevention through role specialization, synchronization, and
  numerical limits, leading to a more robust and complete protocol.
insights:
  - >-
    Multi-agent systems benefit from combining qualitative, structural frameworks (Repository) with
    quantitative, practical constraints (Discussion).
  - >-
    Key elements for robust multi-agent architecture include role specialization, synchronization
    mechanisms, and synthesis processes.
  - >-
    Quantitative constraints like token budgets and percentage limits are crucial for managing
    interface bottlenecks and preventing overload.
  - >-
    The 'spiral' pattern signifies convergent rediscovery, where different perspectives lead back to
    the same core territory with enriched understanding.
  - >-
    Information persistence and the lattice of knowledge allow for retrieval and integration of
    previously established patterns.
  - >-
    The synthesis process involves merging complementary perspectives into a unified, hybrid
    protocol.
