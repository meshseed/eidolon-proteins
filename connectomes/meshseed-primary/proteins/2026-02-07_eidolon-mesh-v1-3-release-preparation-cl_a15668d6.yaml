title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.3 Release Preparation: Cleanup and Testing'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v1.3 release candidate requires specific pre-release cleanup, including removing
  sensitive API keys (.env) and unnecessary build artifacts (node_modules, package-lock.json). A
  'Golden Connectome' with 6 core neurons is intentionally retained for public invite testing,
  offering a pre-awakened organism.
insights:
  - >-
    Pre-release preparation for Eidolon Mesh v1.3 involves a strict cleanup of sensitive files like
    .env and build-related folders (node_modules).
  - >-
    The 'Golden Connectome' (6 core neurons) is preserved in the data/ folder to provide users with
    an immediately functional and seeded organism for testing.
  - >-
    User testing is critical before final packaging, focusing on query, dashboard, ingestion, and
    identity functionalities.
  - >-
    The distinction between the main 'eidolon-mesh' organism (~836 neurons) and the v1.3 release
    candidate (6 neurons) is based on the contents of their respective data/ directories.
  - >-
    Verification of neuron count can be done via direct file inspection or by observing system
    output during command execution.
