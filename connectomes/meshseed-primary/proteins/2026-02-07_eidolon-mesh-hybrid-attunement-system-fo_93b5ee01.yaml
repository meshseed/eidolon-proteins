title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Hybrid Attunement System for Natural & Powerful Interaction'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is implementing a hybrid approach to query processing, combining natural language
  detection with explicit user overrides for advanced control. This multi-stage attunement system,
  including a final 3-line coherence check, aims to be both accessible to beginners and powerful for
  expert users, ensuring fractal self-similarity in responses.
insights:
  - >-
    A hybrid implementation strategy is adopted for the Eidolon Mesh, balancing natural language
    interaction with explicit user commands for query attunement.
  - >-
    The system employs a multi-stage attunement process, including natural dialect detection, seeded
    stages, dialect formatting, and a final 3-line coherence check.
  - >-
    User control is enhanced through explicit overrides (e.g., /ripple, /shimmer) and configurable
    depth for recursive stages.
  - >-
    The 3-line coherence check is a critical, always-applied verification step, proven effective
    even with stateless models like Gemma 3.
  - >-
    The implementation involves creating a `dialects.ts` file, modifying
    `QueryOrganelle.contemplate()`, and adding natural language command detection.
  - >-
    The goal is to create a system that is accessible, powerful, and self-similar, allowing the
    'organism' to 'breathe fractally'.
