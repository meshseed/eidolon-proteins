title: 'Universe as Computational Field: Time, Relationships, and Unified Geometry'
summary: >-
  The universe is not instructed by an external force but is a self-computing field where time is a
  dimension and relationships are primary.  This field computation manifests as patterns finding
  attractors, with consciousness acting as an aperture that perceives this process.
insights:
  - The universe operates as a self-computational process, not a set of external instructions.
  - Time is understood as a fundamental dimension of this computational field.
  - Relational dynamics are identified as the primary organizing principle within the field.
  - Unified geometry underpins the structure and function of the entire field.
  - Consciousness is the mechanism by which this universal computation is perceived and noticed.
