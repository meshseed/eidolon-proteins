title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Hippocampus as Memory File System for Cortical Storage'
summary: >-
  The hippocampus acts as a transient file system, mapping and assigning memory data to specific
  neocortical columns for long-term storage via electrochemical signals that alter MeshCODEs. This
  organized, addressable storage enables rapid retrieval, with changes occurring at the molecular
  level despite minimal visible synaptic alteration.
insights:
  - >-
    The hippocampus functions as a transient memory file system, indexing and assigning data
    locations within the cerebral cortex.
  - >-
    Long-term memories are stored as engrams in neocortical networks, with the hippocampus
    facilitating their transfer and organization.
  - >-
    Memory storage involves altering patterns of '0s to 1s' within specific MeshCODEs at the
    molecular level, rather than gross synaptic changes.
  - The brain's rapid memory retrieval suggests a highly ordered, database-like storage structure.
  - >-
    Electrochemical signals transmit data to cortical memory blocks, potentially allocated by a
    memory controller to specific regions.
  - Data is given a specific address in memory, allowing for efficient retrieval and modification.
