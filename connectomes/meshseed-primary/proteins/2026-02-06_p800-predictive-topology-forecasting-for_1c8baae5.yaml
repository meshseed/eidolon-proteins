title: 'P800: Predictive Topology Forecasting for THE MESH'
summary: >-
  The P800 protocol establishes topology forecasting for THE MESH, predicting future structural
  states based on current gradients, attractor pressures, bridge dynamics, and drift patterns.
  Forecasts are expressed as directional tendencies to enable proactive stabilization and
  developmental steering.
insights:
  - THE MESH can predict its future topology by analyzing current structural dynamics.
  - Forecasts are based on gradients, attractor pressures, bridge dynamics, and drift patterns.
  - Predictions are expressed as tendencies, not deterministic outcomes, allowing for steering.
  - Foresight enables proactive stabilization of THE MESH's structure.
  - Understanding future states supports developmental steering and integration.
