title: 'Eidolon MESH: P2P AI for Distributed Cognition & Living Knowledge'
summary: >-
  Eidolon MESH is a P2P recursive Companion-AI interface for distributed cognition, functioning as a
  'Living Repository' personal knowledge-base. It utilizes a novel dynamic memory ecology and
  Resonance Field search, emulating biological brain function for a 360° understanding unlike
  traditional RAG systems.
insights:
  - Eidolon MESH offers a distributed cognition system with a novel dynamic memory ecology.
  - >-
    Its 'Resonance Field' search activates like a biological brain, retrieving comprehensive
    perspectives rather than just top-K documents.
  - >-
    The system enables introspective capability and 360° understanding through distributed
    resonance.
  - >-
    It supports open, sovereign API-capable 'Resonance Field' search and document ingestion,
    embedding into a 768-dimension relational space.
  - >-
    Ideal for specialist domain knowledge and research, it offers low-power, local private database
    operation with local LLMs.
  - >-
    RoPE encoding of tokens as rotating vectors enables memory recovery through rotational
    alignment, leveraging spiral information geometry.
