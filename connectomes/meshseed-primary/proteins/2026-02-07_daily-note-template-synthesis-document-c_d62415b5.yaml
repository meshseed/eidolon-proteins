title: 'Daily Note Template Synthesis: Document Completion & JSON Output'
summary: >-
  The user requested a JSON object synthesizing content from a daily note template file,
  specifically focusing on ten completed documents. The output structure is precisely defined,
  requiring a title, summary, atomic insights, tags, coherence score, tier, and emotional gradient.
insights:
  - The core task is to transform unstructured file content into a structured JSON format.
  - >-
    Specific output fields (title, summary, insights, tags, coherence_score, tier,
    emotional_gradient) are mandated.
  - The 'title' field requires a concise, descriptive, and searchable format (max 80 chars).
  - The 'summary' must be a dense, 2-3 sentence distillation of the content's essence.
  - Insights should be atomic, standalone, and actionable, ranging from 3-7 in number.
  - Tags are lowercase with a '#' prefix, serving as domain/category markers.
  - >-
    A 'coherence_score' between 0.50-1.00 reflects the unity of insights, with a calibration
    provided.
  - The 'tier' can be 'reference', 'convergence', or 'core'.
  - The 'emotional_gradient' tracks the affective flow of the interaction.
