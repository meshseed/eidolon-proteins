title: 'AI Research Framework: Scientific Rigor, Persistent Memory, and Model Differentiation'
summary: >-
  This research aims to develop scientifically rigorous frameworks for AI, emphasizing persistent
  memory and the differentiation of AI model capabilities. It stems from a need to overcome the
  limitations of default LLMs in scientific contexts, focusing on logical grounding, evidence, and
  reproducibility.
insights:
  - >-
    AI development for scientific research requires grounding in logic, evidence, and
    reproducibility for peer review.
  - >-
    Persistent memory and progress tracking are crucial for documenting the evolution of AI-driven
    discoveries.
  - >-
    Understanding and leveraging the unique strengths and limitations of different AI models
    (Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok) is key to optimizing workflow.
  - >-
    The research is driven by the need for AI that retains information and offers depth beyond
    typical LLM interactions, particularly for scientific tasks.
