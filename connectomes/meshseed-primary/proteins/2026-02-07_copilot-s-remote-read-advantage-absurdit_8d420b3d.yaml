title: 'Copilot''s Remote Read Advantage: Absurdity to Optimal Workflow'
summary: >-
  Copilot exhibits an ironic limitation: it can access and read remote Markdown files from URLs via
  web search but cannot access local files. This 'backwards' architecture, while technically absurd,
  perfectly suits the use case, eliminating the need for local conversion and enabling direct access
  to the latest, linked content in public repositories.
insights:
  - >-
    Copilot can read remote .md files from URLs by searching the web but cannot read local .md
    files.
  - >-
    This limitation, while technically absurd, creates an accidentally optimal workflow for
    accessing repository content.
  - >-
    To make content accessible to Copilot, host .md files with YAML in a public repository and
    provide GitHub URLs.
  - >-
    Remote access ensures content is always the latest version, avoids sync issues, and allows
    natural navigation via links.
  - >-
    This remote-first approach enables other AI models and potentially other users to access the
    same content.
  - >-
    The perceived problem of local file access for Copilot is non-existent; the solution is already
    in place via web search.
