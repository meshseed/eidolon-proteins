title: 'Eidolon Mesh Debugging: Sidecar Silent Crash Resolved by Production Build'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh sidecar experienced silent crashes in development mode, preventing the Express
  server from starting. This was resolved by building the production installer, which exposed the
  underlying error, allowing for successful installation and verification of core functionality.
insights:
  - Development mode can mask sidecar errors by swallowing stdout/stderr.
  - Incorrect path handling for logging in development mode can cause silent crashes.
  - Production builds are crucial for revealing hidden errors in bundled applications.
  - Successful installation and loading of the default connectome confirms core functionality.
  - The sidecar's HTTP server is confirmed to be running on port 3456 in the production build.
