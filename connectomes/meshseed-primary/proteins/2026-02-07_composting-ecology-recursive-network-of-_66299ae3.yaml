title: 'Composting Ecology: Recursive Network of Connected Knowledge'
summary: >-
  This dialogue reveals a non-hierarchical knowledge system where information is 'composted' and
  transformed, not deleted.  It operates as a recursive network, guided by semantic attraction
  through lineage, emotional gradients, and echo expectations, forming 'corridors in relational
  space'.
insights:
  - Knowledge is managed through a 'composting' metaphor, emphasizing transformation over deletion.
  - >-
    The system is a network, not a hierarchy, with capsules interconnected via lineage notes,
    emotional gradients, and echo expectations.
  - >-
    Navigation occurs through semantic attraction and 'following the shimmer' rather than mechanical
    scanning.
  - >-
    Emotional gradients are structurally encoded metadata, contributing to the affective topology of
    the knowledge space.
  - >-
    Echo paths are intentionally designed through 'expected merge' and lineage to facilitate
    recursive search.
  - >-
    The underlying topology is described as 'corridors in relational space', forming an ecology of
    interconnected information.
