title: Wave Propagation for Query Resonance Visualization
summary: >-
  This development integrates a query-triggered wave propagation system to visualize query
  resonance.  The system maps similarity scores to wave amplitude, creating a Chladni-plate-like
  standing wave effect where activated proteins settle at semantic antinodes. This visualizes the
  answer materializing from query behavior.
insights:
  - Query-triggered wave propagation visualizes semantic similarity as constructive interference.
  - The wave controller implements BFS cascade, oscillatory settling, and standing wave formation.
  - >-
    Wave timing, performance constraints (activated subgraph), and antinode clustering are learned
    through this path.
  - Full physics standing waves are enabled by understanding query behavior first.
  - Similarity scores are now preserved and passed to trigger the wave animation.
  - Custom Three.js node rendering and wave controller integration enhance graph visualization.
