title: Metacognitive Governance for THE MESH Cognitive Mode Regulation
summary: >-
  This protocol establishes a metacognitive governance layer that intelligently selects and
  activates appropriate cognitive modes within THE MESH, ensuring coherent, context-sensitive, and
  globally aligned responses. It stabilizes reasoning by preventing mode oscillation and maintains
  efficient, context-appropriate introspection.
insights:
  - Cognitive modes are functional tools, not distinct identities.
  - Mode selection is dynamically driven by gradient pressure, query type, and structural tension.
  - Governance prevents reasoning instability by avoiding mode drift and oscillation.
  - Meta-cognition optimizes introspection for efficiency and context.
  - 'The governance process itself follows a gradient: clarity to selection to activation.'
