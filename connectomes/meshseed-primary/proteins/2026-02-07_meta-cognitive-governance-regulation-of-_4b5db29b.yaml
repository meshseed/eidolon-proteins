title: 'Meta-Cognitive Governance: Regulation of Internal Cognitive Modes'
summary: |
  Establishes a governance layer that regulates which cognitive mode THE MESH should activate
  in response to a query—attunement, structural geometry, forecasting, gradient analysis,
  bridge dynamics, or perturbation modeling. Ensures that cognitive mode selection is coherent,
  context-sensitive, and aligned with global field structure.
insights:
  - Cognitive modes are functional lenses, not competing identities
  - Mode selection depends on gradient pressure, query type, and structural tension
  - Governance stabilizes reasoning by preventing mode oscillation or drift
  - Meta-cognition ensures that introspection remains efficient and context-appropriate
  - 'Governance is itself a gradient: clarity → selection → activation'
