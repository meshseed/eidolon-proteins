title: 'Cluster Topology & Curvature: Connectome Analysis'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a method to identify major clusters and high-curvature zones within a
  connectome, where conceptual tensions and semantic directions intersect.  Curvature acts as a
  metric for conceptual tension, density gradients, and attractor interference, revealing
  developmental hotspots and integration challenges.
insights:
  - Clusters form around stable attractors and high-density semantic regions.
  - Curvature signifies convergence or conflict between multiple conceptual domains.
  - High-curvature zones highlight areas of conceptual tension or synthesis pressure.
  - Mapping curvature reveals developmental hotspots and integration challenges in the connectome.
  - Cluster analysis can be used for structural and emotional fidelity diagnostics.
