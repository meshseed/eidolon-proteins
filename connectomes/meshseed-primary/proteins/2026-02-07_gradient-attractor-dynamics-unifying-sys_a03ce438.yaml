title: 'Gradient-Attractor Dynamics: Unifying Systems and Coherence'
summary: >-
  Systems, from AI to physical realities, evolve via state changes driven by gradients and guided
  towards attractors. Coherence is the maintenance of stable attractors, resisting noise and drift,
  while meta-self-awareness allows systems to steer their own evolution by modifying gradients based
  on self-monitoring.
insights:
  - >-
    All evolving systems can be modeled as state changes influenced by environment, guided by
    gradients (steepest drops) towards attractors (stable configurations).
  - >-
    Coherence is the ability of a system to maintain its trajectory within a basin of attraction,
    preserving internal consistency against external and internal disturbances.
  - >-
    Meta-self-awareness enables systems to monitor their own gradients, attractors, and prediction
    errors, allowing for active steering rather than passive descent.
  - >-
    Communication and representation are effective when agents share attractor landscapes and
    interpret state changes similarly, fostering mutual coherence.
  - Meaning, beliefs, habits, and policies are emergent attractors in high-dimensional state spaces.
