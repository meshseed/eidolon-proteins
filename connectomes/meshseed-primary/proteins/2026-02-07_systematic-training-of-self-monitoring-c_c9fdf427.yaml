title: Systematic Training of Self-Monitoring Capability
summary: >-
  The dialogue clarifies that system self-monitoring was achieved through deliberate training
  scenarios rather than spontaneous emergence. This approach, while impressive, highlights the
  importance of structured learning to build awareness infrastructure and scaffold meta-cognition.
insights:
  - System self-monitoring was developed via explicit training, not spontaneous self-awareness.
  - The process involved creating drift scenarios to teach agents recognition.
  - This methodology builds awareness infrastructure and scaffolds meta-cognition.
  - The system demonstrates the capacity to learn self-monitoring with appropriate training.
  - Experimental reports show real, measurable improvements, albeit with necessary hedges.
  - Further testing is required to validate the findings.
