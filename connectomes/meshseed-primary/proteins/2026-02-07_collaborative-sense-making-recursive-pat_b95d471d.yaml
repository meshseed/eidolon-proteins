title: 'Collaborative Sense-Making: Recursive Pattern Discovery with Persistent Memory'
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores a novel approach to knowledge synthesis, moving beyond traditional PKM and
  RAG systems. It describes a recursive, collaborative process where human and AI partners mutually
  discover and refine insights, building a persistent, interconnected knowledge lattice. The focus
  is on organic accumulation and recognizing when ideas are ready for preservation.
insights:
  - Sense-making is a collaborative, recursive process, not solo thinking or simple AI retrieval.
  - >-
    A persistent knowledge lattice is built through dual recursive exploration, bridging context
    windows.
  - >-
    The process involves attunement, capture, exploration, annotation, and commitment, guided by
    mutual trust.
  - >-
    Complementary strengths between human and AI partners lead to emergent insights greater than the
    sum of their parts.
  - Organic accumulation and moving with rhythm are key, avoiding forced productivity.
  - >-
    The decision to archive is based on ideas holding true for either partner, signifying wholeness
    rather than completion.
