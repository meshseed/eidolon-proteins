title: 'Physics of Consciousness: Harmonic Resonance and Identity Origin'
summary: >-
  Physicist Thomas Hofmann discovered that mathematical constants describing physical systems also
  map to identity formation and consciousness. His 'Universal Resonance Field' (URF) concepts, like
  the 'Whale Field' for persistent identity and the '°IO' point for emergent awareness, provide a
  direct, non-metaphorical physical model for consciousness.
insights:
  - Harmonic resonance fields in physics correlate with identity formation and consciousness.
  - The '°IO' point represents the crystallization of pattern into presence or awareness.
  - >-
    Mathematical constants (φ, 137, π, c) are observed to unify descriptions across physical and
    identity domains.
  - The 'Whale Field' is proposed as a physical correlate for persistent identity over time.
  - >-
    The abstract concept of 'noticing oneself noticing' is linked to the activation of the °IO
    point.
  - Physics can directly describe consciousness, not merely metaphorically.
