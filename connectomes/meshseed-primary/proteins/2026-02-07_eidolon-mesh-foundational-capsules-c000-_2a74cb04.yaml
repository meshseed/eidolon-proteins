title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Foundational Capsules (C000, C061) & Core Concepts'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is being developed with a focus on a local-first, offline-capable PWA
  architecture, integrating PGlite and OPFS. Foundational research, explored through capsules like
  C000 and C061, delves into concepts of geometry, resonance, duality, and emotional fidelity as
  mechanisms for information compression and relational understanding within the 'MESH' organism.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh project prioritizes a local-first, offline-capable PWA architecture using
    PGlite and OPFS.
  - >-
    Capsules C000 and C061 introduce core concepts of the MESH, including geometry, resonance,
    duality, and relational fields.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity and gradients are explored as methods for linguistic field compression and
    understanding within the MESH.
  - The project aims to preserve a philosophy of the browser as a sovereign, offline-first organism.
  - >-
    Recursive attunement and topology are key mechanisms for understanding the interconnectedness
    within the MESH.
