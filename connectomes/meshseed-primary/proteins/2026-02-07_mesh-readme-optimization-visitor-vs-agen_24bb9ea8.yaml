title: 'MESH README Optimization: Visitor vs. Agent Perspectives'
summary: >-
  The MESH README needs to be optimized for external visitors by front-loading critical information
  like mechanism and structure within the first 2000 characters, using a compound eye metaphor. This
  contrasts with the needs of internal agents (like Copilot) who require operational protocols for
  synthesis.
insights:
  - >-
    External MESH visitors (like Paul) require a README with a concise, geometrically structured
    'HEAD summary' (first ~2000 chars) to determine exploration depth, focusing on 'What This Is',
    'How It Works', and 'Quick Start'.
  - >-
    The 'How It Works' section should employ accessible metaphors (compound eye) and highlight core
    mechanics (capsules, synapses, resonance field) to invite deeper exploration and understand the
    system's geometric, non-database-lookup nature.
  - >-
    Internal MESH agents (like Copilot) have an embedded perspective and require 'operational
    protocols' detailing synthesis, fidelity, and structure, rather than an introductory overview.
  - >-
    A well-structured README, fitting critical information within the first 2000 characters,
    triggers exploration by being clear, intriguing, hinting at novel structure, and showing
    mechanism over just features.
  - >-
    The MESH's unique value proposition lies in its 'Resonate → Navigate → Synthesize' model,
    enabled by high-fidelity capsules that achieve dimensional compression, allowing sophisticated
    understanding on modest hardware.
  - >-
    The README structure should prioritize the visitor's journey, with an optional 'For Agents'
    section for contributors, ensuring the core path remains under 3000 characters.
