title: 'Mesh Tiering: Infrastructure vs. Feature Limitations'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is evolving its tier system to prioritize user convenience and infrastructure access over
  artificial feature limitations.  The Free tier offers full functionality with user-provided LLM
  access, while a low-cost 'Mesh' tier provides seamless API integration.
insights:
  - >-
    Tier system re-focuses on ease of use and infrastructure (API access, self-hosting) rather than
    limiting core features.
  - >-
    Free tier provides unlimited proteins/neurons and all metabolism/visualization features,
    requiring users to supply their own LLM.
  - >-
    A low-cost 'Mesh' tier (~$3/month) offers all Free tier benefits plus seamless integration with
    the Mesh API for enhanced convenience.
  - >-
    The goal is to make advanced Mesh capabilities accessible and easy to start with, rather than
    creating artificial barriers.
