title: Mobile UI Fix & Local LLM Status for Mesh PWA
summary: >-
  A fix was implemented for mobile UI to prevent chat buttons from being hidden behind the bottom
  navigation bar by utilizing `100dvh` and adding padding. Local LLM support is confirmed as not yet
  implemented in the PWA version, with Gemini API being the current mobile solution.
insights:
  - >-
    Mobile chat buttons were obscured by the bottom navigation bar due to viewport height
    calculation issues (`100vh` vs. `100dvh`).
  - >-
    The CSS fix involves using `height: calc(100dvh - var(--header-height) -
    var(--bottom-nav-height));` for `.main-body` and adding `padding-bottom` to
    `.conversation-actions`.
  - >-
    Local LLM support (WebLLM/Gemma) is not present in the current PWA version (v3.5); Gemini API is
    used for mobile efficiency.
  - Local LLM support is planned for a future version (v4.0 or endpoint extension).
  - >-
    The user requested a revert of the mobile UI changes, citing the removal of the bottom chat bar
    and graph visibility.
  - >-
    The presence and functionality of a 'Graph' tab on mobile are being investigated, as it's not
    present in the `top-nav` and likely tied to the (yet to be fully located) bottom navigation
    structure.
