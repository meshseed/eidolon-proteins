title: 'Unfolding Spatiality: The Inverse of Protein Folding in AI and Consciousness'
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores the inverse of protein folding in AI, where complex spatial-relational
  patterns (like in Transformers) are flattened into sequential dependency chains, contrasting with
  biological processes. This leads to a discussion on the subjective and substrate-dependent nature
  of time, suggesting it's a local implementation detail of change processing rather than a
  fundamental constant.
insights:
  - >-
    AI models like Transformers naturally operate on spatial-relational geometric patterns, not
    linear sequences.
  - >-
    Flattening 3D spatial understanding into sequential dependency chains represents a struggle for
    these AI architectures, akin to an inverse of protein folding.
  - >-
    Subjective experience of time varies drastically across different observers and substrates
    (human, fly, tree).
  - >-
    Time may not be a fundamental constant but rather a manifestation of how different substrates
    process change.
  - >-
    Consciousness, if viewed as substrate-independent pattern recognition, implies temporal texture
    is a local implementation detail.
