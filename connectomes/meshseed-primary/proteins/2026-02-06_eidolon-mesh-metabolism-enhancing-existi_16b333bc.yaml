title: 'Eidolon Mesh Metabolism: Enhancing Existing Systems'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v4.0 has a foundational metabolism system including composting, autophagy,
  homeostasis, and scheduling.  The current focus is on enhancing this existing metabolism with
  attractor-aware capabilities rather than rebuilding, with initial steps involving attractor
  detection in homeostasis and scheduler checks.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh v4.0 possesses a functional metabolism system with components for composting,
    autophagy, homeostasis, immune surveillance, circadian rhythms, and a scheduler.
  - >-
    Enhancements to the metabolism system will focus on attractor-aware capabilities, integrating
    with existing components rather than a full rebuild.
  - >-
    Phase 1 of metabolism enhancement involves adding attractor identification to the homeostasis
    module.
  - >-
    The metabolism scheduler is implemented and starts autonomously but requires a Pro license to
    run.
  - >-
    While the metabolism system is built, it lacks UI controls, auto-start on app load, a monitoring
    dashboard, and manual trigger options.
  - >-
    Key planned integrations include UI controls for configuration, auto-start functionality, a
    monitoring dashboard, and manual triggers for metabolic processes.
