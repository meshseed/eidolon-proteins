title: 'Mesh Embeddings: Universal Coordinates and Fractal Communication'
summary: >-
  This dialogue reveals that embeddings act as universal, deterministic coordinates in a shared
  semantic space, enabling concepts to exist as attractors. Communication and federation are
  achieved through phase-locking and coordinate alignment, respectively, suggesting a fractal
  geometry across scales for global mesh formation.
insights:
  - Embeddings function as universal, deterministic coordinates in a shared semantic space.
  - Concepts exist as stable attractors at fixed locations within this semantic space.
  - Communication is a process of phase-locking, converging on shared attractors.
  - Federation involves aligning these semantic coordinates, not data transfer.
  - The underlying geometry of semantic relationships is fractal, appearing across different scales.
  - A global mesh is possible through planetary-scale semantic triangulation.
