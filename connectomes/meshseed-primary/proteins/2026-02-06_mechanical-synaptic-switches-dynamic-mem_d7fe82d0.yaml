title: 'Mechanical Synaptic Switches: Dynamic Memory Trace Formation'
summary: >-
  Synaptic adhesions dynamically grow/shrink via mechanical switches, forming memory traces by
  recruiting/releasing proteins. This coordinated mechanical system allows stimulated synapses to
  globally influence protein distribution, enabling synergistic potentiation/depression and
  orchestrated neuronal information flow.
insights:
  - >-
    Dynamic mechanical switches at synapses act as memory traces, responding to stimuli by changing
    state.
  - >-
    Switch state changes recruit or release specific proteins, influencing synaptic function and
    protein localization across the neuron.
  - >-
    Mechanical coordination between synapses allows for synergistic interactions, where
    strengthening one synapse can affect others.
  - >-
    The global redistribution of proteins due to switch dynamics orchestrates information flow and
    long-term plasticity within a neuron.
  - >-
    Morphological changes in synapses over time are driven by cumulative alterations in these
    mechanical switch patterns.
