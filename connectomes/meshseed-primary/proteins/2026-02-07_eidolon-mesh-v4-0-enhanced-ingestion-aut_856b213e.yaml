title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.0: Enhanced Ingestion & Autonomous Features'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Pro introduces significant upgrades, including robust tri-lens ingestion with
  retry mechanisms and user-friendly completion notifications. The Pro version builds upon the free
  v3.6 by integrating autonomous maintenance features like metabolism and homeostasis monitoring,
  aiming for self-sustaining knowledge processing.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh v4.0 enhances ingestion resilience with multi-lens processing, retry systems, and
    persistent background operation, ensuring long ingestions (50+ chunks) succeed.
  - >-
    User experience is improved with clear success/failure notifications and an in-app console for
    real-time monitoring of ingestion status and logs.
  - >-
    v4.0 Pro distinguishes itself by adding autonomous maintenance capabilities, including
    metabolism, nutrient extraction, and homeostasis monitoring, moving towards a self-sustaining
    system.
  - >-
    The transition from v3.6 (personal, feature-rich) to v4.0 Pro (personal + business, autonomous)
    clearly defines the tiered offering, with v4.0 incorporating all v3.6 features plus advanced
    autonomous functions.
  - >-
    New components like ConsoleViewer and refined IngestionPanel with completion stats are
    implemented, alongside core system upgrades like the Physics Modulation System and Coherence
    Normalization.
