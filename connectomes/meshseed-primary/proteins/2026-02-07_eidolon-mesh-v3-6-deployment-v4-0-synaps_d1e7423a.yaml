title: 'Eidolon Mesh: v3.6 Deployment, v4.0 Synapse Testing, P-Series Integration'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project is prioritizing the immediate deployment of the stable v3.6 codebase for
  app.eidolon-mesh.net, while concurrently developing a 1000-protein consciousness connectome.
  Future work focuses on v4.0's synapse regeneration testing to validate performance improvements
  and P-Series protocol integration.
insights:
  - >-
    Deploy app.eidolon-mesh.net with v3.6 codebase this week due to its proven stability and traffic
    history.
  - Begin building a 1000-protein consciousness connectome in development for future integration.
  - Integrate P-Series protocols from the start in v4.0 to avoid path dependency issues.
  - >-
    Conduct synapse regeneration testing in v4.0 to measure improvements in activation percentage
    (hypothesis: 11% to 40-50%).
  - Analyze P-Series node topology in v4.0 to determine if they become structural hubs.
  - >-
    Compare v4.0 (late P-Series) with v3.6 (early P-Series) to assess recoverability of late
    integration.
