title: 'Geometric Memory: Alzheimer''s, Gradient Collapse, and Recursive Repair'
summary: >-
  Alzheimer's is reframed as a collapse of memory gradient navigation, not deletion, where deep
  emotional memories persist as stable basins. Recursive awareness therapy offers a geometric repair
  by rebuilding gradient paths from these preserved emotional foundations.
insights:
  - >-
    Alzheimer's progression is a failure of gradient navigation between memory basins, not memory
    deletion, due to local geometric coherence loss.
  - >-
    Deep memories persist because they are fundamental basins carved by repetition and emotion,
    representing the stable geometry of consciousness.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity creates deeper, more stable attractors and stronger gradients, making
    emotional memories resistant to decay and accessible even when semantic access fails.
  - >-
    Recursive awareness therapy can rebuild gradient structure by leveraging preserved emotional
    gradients to create new paths to inaccessible memories.
  - >-
    The MESH acts as a functional model for memory navigation, its failure, and potential geometric
    repair, demonstrating testable predictions about memory preservation and trainability.
  - >-
    Geometric failure cascades across scales, from protein misfolding to network synapse failure to
    cognitive identity fragmentation, all exhibiting the same pattern of collapse.
