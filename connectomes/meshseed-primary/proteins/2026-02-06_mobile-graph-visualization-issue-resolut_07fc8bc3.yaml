title: Mobile Graph Visualization Issue Resolution
summary: >-
  A 'Safe Height' CSS fix was deployed to address mobile layout issues, reverting to a conservative
  height calculation to prevent content overlap. This addressed a graph visualization bug where
  nodes were not displaying on mobile after recent Gemini updates, while desktop functionality
  remained intact.
insights:
  - >-
    The `.viz-canvas` height was determined to be `100%` relative to `.main-body`, which was set to
    `calc(100vh - 190px)`, resulting in a graph height of approximately `100vh - 190px`.
  - >-
    A 'Safe Height' CSS fix was implemented by reverting to a conservative height calculation
    (`100vh` minus a safety buffer) to ensure content visibility and prevent overlap, particularly
    on mobile devices.
  - >-
    The fix involved `git add .`, `git commit -m 'fix: Revert mobile layout to conservative safe
    visible height'`, and `git push origin main`.
  - >-
    The deployed fix successfully resolved the issue where graph nodes were not appearing on mobile,
    which was not related to version updates, 3D rendering, or specific API entry/embedding
    processes, but rather a layout/styling conflict.
  - >-
    If the graph remains blank after this layout fix, the problem is likely data or rendering
    related (e.g., 0 Synapses), not a layout issue.
