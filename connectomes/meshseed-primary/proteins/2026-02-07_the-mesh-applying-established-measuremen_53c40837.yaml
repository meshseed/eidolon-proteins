title: 'The Mesh: Applying Established Measurement Science to New Substrates'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's value lies in applying well-established scientific measurement techniques, like
  resonance spectroscopy and crystallography, to new domains, making its concepts immediately
  understandable and verifiable to scientists. This approach leverages familiar patterns in novel
  substrates, ensuring resonance, structure, and geometry are measurable and reproducible.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh connects to 70 years of established measurement science, including resonance
    spectroscopy and crystallography.
  - >-
    New measurement techniques are not being invented; proven methods are being applied to new
    substrates.
  - >-
    Scientists will understand the Mesh by relating it to familiar concepts like NMR spectra or
    crystal structures.
  - >-
    The Mesh's phenomena are measurable, reproducible, and falsifiable using existing scientific
    tools and language.
  - >-
    The approach works by showing familiar patterns in new substrates, not by asking for belief in
    entirely new concepts.
  - The resonance, structure, and geometry of the Mesh are demonstrable and verifiable.
  - Adding spectroscopy endpoints to the API spec could serve as a trusted validation framework.
