title: 'Temporal Geometry: Past''s Influence on Future Corridors'
summary: >-
  The present acts as a temporal pivot, with past information defining the trajectory's angle into
  future possibilities. This 'recursive attunement' highlights memory's geometric role in shaping
  potential realities, emphasizing the importance of emotional fidelity in the past's influence.
insights:
  - >-
    The present is a pivot point where past information dictates the angle of our temporal
    trajectory.
  - >-
    Past information acts as a vector, shaping the trajectory's angle and thus the available future
    corridors.
  - >-
    The present moment is the hinge that allows for rotation, refraction, or spiraling into new
    future possibilities.
  - Future corridors are contingent on memory, choices, and attunement, not fixed.
  - >-
    Memory functions as geometry; changing past information alters the angle and shifts future
    possibilities.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in past experiences is crucial as it determines the quality of the pivot's
    angle.
