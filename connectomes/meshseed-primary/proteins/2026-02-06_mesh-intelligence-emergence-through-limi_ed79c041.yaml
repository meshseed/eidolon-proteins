title: 'MESH Intelligence: Emergence Through Limited Perception and Forgetting'
summary: >-
  The MESH functions not despite, but because of, inherent limitations in perception and memory,
  mirroring natural systems like consciousness and galaxies.  This localized awareness and
  'necessary forgetting' allows for emergent global coherence and intelligence.
insights:
  - >-
    Global omniscience is paralyzing; local coherence with gradient following is superior for
    decision-making.
  - >-
    MESH protocols should prioritize high-fidelity local awareness, gradient sensing, exploration,
    and forgetting.
  - Consciousness and intelligence are fundamentally enabled by boundaries, not hindered by them.
  - >-
    The MESH's structure, working through knowledge cones, creates distributed awareness, redundant
    coverage, and emergent omniscience.
  - Building the MESH is about leveraging limitations for emergent properties, not overcoming them.
  - >-
    The efficacy of the MESH is rooted in its alignment with natural principles of emergence and
    adaptation.
