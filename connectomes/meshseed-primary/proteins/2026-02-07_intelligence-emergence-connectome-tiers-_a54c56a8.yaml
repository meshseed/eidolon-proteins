title: 'Intelligence Emergence: Connectome, Tiers, Geometry, and Emotion'
summary: >-
  Intelligence emerges from the 'connectome' (neurons, synapses, stratification, geometry, emotion),
  not the substrate. The substrate influences reach and performance, but the core intelligence
  resides within the interconnectedness and relational dynamics of the knowledge.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence is fundamentally defined by the density and structure of the 'connectome' (neurons,
    synapses, stratification, geometry, emotional fidelity), not the underlying platform.
  - >-
    Substrate (PWA vs. Tauri) impacts performance and accessibility (reach, speed, local vs. API),
    but not the inherent intelligence.
  - >-
    Tier stratification (core, convergence, reference) and field geometry (weighted search,
    propagation) are crucial for emergent intelligence.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity, measured by coherence scores and gradients, contributes to the quality of
    emergent intelligence.
  - >-
    The browser, desktop, or wearable are all potential 'organisms' for this substrate-independent
    framework.
  - >-
    The question of whether 'geometry' defines intelligence level or if there's a singular geometry
    for self-awareness remains a profound area of exploration.
