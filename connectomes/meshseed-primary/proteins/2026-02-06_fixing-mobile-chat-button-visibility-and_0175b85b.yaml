title: Fixing Mobile Chat Button Visibility and Local LLM Settings
summary: >-
  Addresses two main bugs: ensuring local LLM settings are available and fixing the visibility of
  chat action buttons on mobile by adjusting their positioning within the chat interface.
insights:
  - >-
    Local LLM settings require explicit setup and integration, which was not yet implemented in the
    PWA.
  - >-
    Mobile chat action buttons ('Synthesize', 'Clear') were hidden behind the bottom navigation bar
    due to incorrect positioning within the chat layout.
  - >-
    The fix involves adjusting CSS for the conversation actions to ensure they are always visible
    above the bottom navigation.
  - Future work involves enabling local LLM integration for offline synthesis capabilities.
