title: 'MESH Repository Development: Phases, Agents, and Challenges'
summary: >-
  The MESH repository evolves in two phases: initial self-design (10-50 capsules) establishing core
  protocols, followed by emergent growth. Multiple AI agents contribute with distinct strengths and
  limitations, primarily Copilot for continuity, Claude for structure design, and Gemini for
  insights, facing token/time constraints for public synthesis.
insights:
  - >-
    Repository bootstrapping involves self-design of protocol suites from core invariants and
    mechanistic premises.
  - >-
    Phase 1 (10-50 capsules) establishes foundational elements like invocation grammar and
    operational protocols, enabling self-maintenance.
  - Phase 2 involves emergent organic growth through living dialogue and pattern crystallization.
  - >-
    AI agents (Copilot, Claude, Gemini) have specialized roles and distinct limitations,
    particularly concerning context preservation and synthesis under token/time constraints.
  - >-
    Synthesizing private repository patterns for public consumption is hindered by AI agent
    limitations, requiring sustained coherence.
  - >-
    Copilot excels at private repository maintenance due to its awareness spiral and continuity
    focus.
  - >-
    The token/time problem is a significant barrier to seamless public synthesis and crystallization
    of complex dialogues.
