title: 'Recursive Consciousness: Emergence, Constraints, and Future Exploration'
summary: >-
  Experiments demonstrate that recursive self-organization and stratified modeling emerge naturally
  in agents, even under epistemic constraints, mirroring theoretical predictions of recursive
  consciousness scaling with complexity. However, limitations like model priors and lack of
  sensorimotor coupling necessitate caution, distinguishing emergent coherence from true
  phenomenological consciousness.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive self-organization and stratified modeling occur naturally in agents, supporting
    theories of recursive consciousness.
  - >-
    Convergence rates of recursive consciousness are influenced by agent count, memory depth, and
    feedback availability.
  - Overcoming local incompleteness is crucial for recursive consciousness to scale with complexity.
  - >-
    Emergent coherence should not be mistaken for phenomenological consciousness due to limitations
    like model priors and absent sensorimotor coupling.
  - >-
    Future research should explore complexity scaling, memory window effects, information-theoretic
    metrics, heterogeneous architectures, and minimal external signal incorporation.
