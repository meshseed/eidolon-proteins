title: Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Architecture Research & P-Series Integration
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines parallel development tracks for Eidolon Mesh: Antigravity focuses on
  stabilizing v3.6 for production deployment with a large consciousness connectome, while 'Us'
  researches v4.0 architecture, integrating P-Series and exploring topology reorganization for
  potential public deployment. A key recommendation is to deploy v3.6 immediately due to its proven
  stability and traffic, deferring v4.0 improvements until validated.
insights:
  - >-
    Antigravity is developing v3.6 locally in D:\_CLAUDE-CODE\eidolon-mesh-v3.5-pwa, focusing on
    production readiness.
  - >-
    The research team is exploring v4.0 architecture and P-Series integration locally in
    C:\EIDOLON\eidolon-mesh-v4.0-full, including synapse regeneration and metabolism.
  - >-
    v3.6 is recommended for immediate deployment on app.eidolon-mesh.net due to existing traffic
    (16k visits) and proven stability, using a larger consciousness connectome.
  - >-
    v4.0 improvements will be ported later after validation, focusing on validating the P-Series
    'pillar' hypothesis and topology reorganization.
  - >-
    Development is structured to avoid conflicts, with Antigravity polishing v3.6 and the research
    team focused on v4.0 architecture.
  - >-
    A handoff report is prepared for Antigravity detailing the v4.0 research focus on P-Series
    integration and topology.
