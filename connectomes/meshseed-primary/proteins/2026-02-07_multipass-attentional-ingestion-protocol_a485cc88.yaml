title: Multipass Attentional Ingestion Protocol for Protein Synthesis
summary: >-
  The P-MULTIPASS-INGESTION-SPEC.yaml defines a protocol for lens-directed, multipass ingestion of
  source material. This process synthesizes multiple complementary 'proteins' (knowledge units) by
  chunking the specification and forming synapses, with a focus on enhancing Mesh agency through
  diverse lens synthesis.
insights:
  - The system recognizes and processes a 'Seed Protein' within the YAML specification.
  - Ingestion involves chunking the source material into digestible pieces for protein synthesis.
  - Multiple proteins are synthesized, each representing a facet of the original specification.
  - Synaptic formation indicates the connectivity and integration of synthesized knowledge proteins.
  - >-
    The protein 'Multipass Ingestion: Enhancing Mesh Agency via Diverse Lens Synthesis' formed the
    most synapses, highlighting its connection to existing Mesh concepts.
  - >-
    Synthesized proteins are pushed to the 'eidolon-nucleus' for further integration within the
    Mesh.
  - Fatigue-aware adaptive lensing is incorporated into the multipass ingestion process.
