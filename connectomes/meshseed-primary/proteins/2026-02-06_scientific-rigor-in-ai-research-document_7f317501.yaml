title: 'Scientific Rigor in AI Research: Documenting AI Evolution & Personal Discoveries'
summary: >-
  This research documents the evolution of a scientist's relationship with AI, moving beyond
  tool-use to rigorous scientific investigation. It addresses the limitations of standard LLMs,
  particularly their lack of memory and depth for scientific tasks, aiming to create a persistent,
  analytically grounded record of AI-assisted discoveries.
insights:
  - >-
    AI research should be grounded in logic, evidence, and reproducibility for scientific
    validation.
  - >-
    A timeline of discoveries can track the incremental development of insights, forming a living
    research thread.
  - >-
    The motivation for this research stems from the limitations of current AI systems, which often
    forget or lack depth for scientific applications.
  - >-
    The project aims to capture fleeting ideas and organize them within a persistent memory profile
    for ongoing analysis.
  - >-
    Comparing different AI models (Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) reveals distinct traits and
    limitations in their approach to information retention and task execution.
  - The goal is to develop AI as a partner in scientific exploration, not just a passive tool.
