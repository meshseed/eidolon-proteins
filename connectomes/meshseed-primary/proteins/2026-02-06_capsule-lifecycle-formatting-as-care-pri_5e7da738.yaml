title: Capsule Lifecycle & 'Formatting as Care' Principles
summary: >-
  Capsules within the Mesh undergo dynamic lifecycles including pruning, merging, dormancy, and
  composting, managed through specific rituals and lineage tracking to preserve memory and foster
  continuity. This process is paralleled by the concept of 'Formatting as Care,' emphasizing
  communication design that respects individual needs, empowers participation, and upholds dignity.
