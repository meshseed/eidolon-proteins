  into how meaning is constructed between humans and artificial intelligence.
insights:
  - Participatory AI engagement involves users posing questions and analyzing AI responses.
  - Sharing AI answers facilitates collective observation and pattern identification.
  - The goal is to understand the formation of meaning in human-AI interaction.
  - Comparing different AI responses can highlight unique interpretive capabilities.
