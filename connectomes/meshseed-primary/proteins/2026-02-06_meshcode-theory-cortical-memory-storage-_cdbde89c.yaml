title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Cortical Memory Storage Capacity & Addressing'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that the cortex stores long-term memory via dense arrays of synapses
  within pyramidal cells and minicolumns, potentially holding gigabytes of data per cell. This
  mechanism is hypothesized to function like a computer's SSD, with an addressable read-write system
  requiring a detailed neural 'file system' for efficient data allocation and retrieval.
insights:
  - >-
    Each pyramidal cell in the cortex could store approximately 1 MB of data based on 10,000
    synapses with 100 bytes/synapse.
  - >-
    A minicolumn, composed of 100 pyramidal cells, could store around 100 MB, with potential for
    significantly larger capacity from all body cells.
  - >-
    The brain likely requires a memory allocation circuitry and a 'file system' architecture to
    manage writing and retrieving data from such vast neural storage.
  - >-
    Synaptic connection strength may dictate major pathways, forming precisely mapped circuits for
    memory allocation.
  - >-
    The hippocampus is identified as a key area for processing memory information, facilitating
    bidirectional communication with the cortex.
