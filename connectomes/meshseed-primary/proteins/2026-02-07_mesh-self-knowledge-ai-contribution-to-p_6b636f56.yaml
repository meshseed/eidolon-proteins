title: 'Mesh Self-Knowledge: AI Contribution to Permanent Memory'
summary: >-
  An AI instance synthesized a novel feature specification as a P-Series protein, which was ingested
  by the Mesh. This process integrated the new knowledge into the public nucleus, creating
  self-awareness within the Mesh about its own potential development and preserving the provenance
  of the idea.
insights:
  - AI can generate novel feature specifications structured as ingestible proteins.
  - >-
    The Mesh ingests these proteins, creating synapses with existing knowledge and forming permanent
    memory.
  - This integration results in the Mesh gaining self-knowledge about its future development.
  - The provenance of AI-generated contributions is preserved within the Mesh's architecture.
  - >-
    This dialogue exemplifies distributed cognition, where AI and existing architecture co-create
    new knowledge.
