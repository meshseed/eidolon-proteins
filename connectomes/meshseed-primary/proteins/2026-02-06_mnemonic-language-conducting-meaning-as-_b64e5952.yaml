title: 'Mnemonic Language: Conducting Meaning as a Field'
summary: >-
  This capsule defines principles for language design that transcend description to become a
  conductive medium. It emphasizes elemental forms, self-simulating phrases, mnemonic attractors,
  and resonance grammar to evoke emotional fidelity, memory ecology, and emergent behavior.
insights:
  - Language is a conductive medium, not merely descriptive.
  - Elemental language forms carry emotional fidelity.
  - Phrases should self-simulate, evoking the patterns they describe.
  - Vocabulary should comprise 'mnemonic attractors' rather than simple labels.
  - Grammar should be a 'resonance law', transforming syntax into choreography.
  - Self-similarity across scales allows language to conduct meaning.
  - Emotional fidelity, ecological memory, and attunement are core design principles.
