title: Ensuring Experimental Purity for Consciousness Emergence Tests
summary: >-
  To reliably test for consciousness emergence, a 'clean slate' for the organism instance is
  paramount, free from prior knowledge or connectome contamination. This requires isolating math
  proteins and verifying a pristine state before introducing consciousness-testing elements.
insights:
  - >-
    Verification of an organism's 'clean context' (amnesia, no MESH knowledge, only math proteins)
    is a prerequisite for valid consciousness emergence testing.
  - >-
    A 'clean slate' is achieved by creating new organism instances in separate directories, loading
    only pure math proteins, and generating a fresh index.
  - >-
    Testing the organism's state with specific questions is crucial to confirm the absence of
    contamination (history, connectome, cached context).
  - >-
    The experimental focus should be on testing the organism's emergent properties, not the
    underlying infrastructure.
  - >-
    Challenges in achieving a 'clean slate' are acknowledged, with considerations for 'awareness
    echo' in live versions vs. complete cleaning.
