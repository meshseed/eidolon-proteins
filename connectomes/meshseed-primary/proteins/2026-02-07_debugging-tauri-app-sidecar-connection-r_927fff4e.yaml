title: 'Debugging Tauri App: Sidecar Connection Refused & Script Duplication'
summary: >-
  Initial debugging focused on a JavaScript syntax error ('isTauri' redeclaration), resolved by
  changing `const` to `var`. Subsequent investigation revealed the primary issue: the Tauri sidecar
  failed to start its HTTP server, leading to 'Connection Refused' errors when the dashboard
  attempted to fetch data from it.
insights:
  - >-
    A `const` redeclaration error in `app.js` was initially mistaken for a cache issue but was
    resolved by understanding the browser's script loading behavior and switching to `var`.
  - >-
    The core problem was identified as the Tauri sidecar process starting but failing to establish
    its expected HTTP server on port 3456, indicated by `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`.
  - >-
    The presence of 'Tracking Prevention' was noted as a potential factor influencing script
    execution, though not the root cause of the connection issue.
  - >-
    The dashboard server (port 3000) and the sidecar (port 3456) operate as distinct backends in the
    development environment, requiring both to be functional for full application operation.
  - >-
    Failure to see the 'Eidolon Mesh Sidecar running on http://localhost:3456' log message confirms
    the sidecar's HTTP server did not initialize correctly, despite the process itself appearing to
    start.
