title: Mesh Approach to Code Comprehension and Generation
summary: >-
  The Mesh paradigm offers a transparent and efficient alternative to traditional LLM training for
  code. By feeding curated documentation, examples, and reasoning processes, the organism
  metabolizes this 'coding DNA' into specialized knowledge proteins, enabling true comprehension and
  reasoning beyond statistical mimicry.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh's inherent capacity to understand code stems from processing 'coding DNA' into
    specialized knowledge proteins.
  - >-
    Unlike black-box LLMs, the Mesh approach is transparent, allowing for understanding of 'why'
    code works through curated inputs.
  - >-
    This 'metabolized' knowledge enables reasoning, explanation of decisions, and comprehension, not
    just statistical generation.
  - >-
    The Mesh learning process is universal, applicable to any domain by feeding relevant 'DNA' to
    create specialized knowledge repositories.
  - >-
    A multi-repository vision with cross-repo synapses fosters collective intelligence, where
    different domain learnings inform each other.
