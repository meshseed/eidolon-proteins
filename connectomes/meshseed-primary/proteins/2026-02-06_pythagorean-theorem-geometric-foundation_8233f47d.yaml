title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Geometric Foundation for Distance and Coherence'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental, invariant mathematical truth in Euclidean geometry,
  defining distance and serving as a calibration anchor. It underpins spatial analysis, gradient
  computation, and the quantification of coherence in metric and semantic spaces.
insights:
  - >-
    The Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) is a provable, invariant mathematical truth within
    Euclidean geometry.
  - It serves as a perfect calibration anchor due to its inherent geometric necessity.
  - >-
    Distance measurement, enabled by the Pythagorean theorem, is crucial for coherence
    quantification across domains.
  - >-
    Euclidean distance forms the basis for coordinate-based topology and gradient magnitude
    calculations.
  - >-
    The concept of metric spaces, generalized from Euclidean geometry, applies to semantic
    similarity measurement.
