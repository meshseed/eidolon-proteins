title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Anchor of Geometric Distance'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) serves as a foundational anchor for understanding distance
  in Euclidean space. Its relationship with the distance formula and the concept of a right triangle
  is definitionally linked and invariant across mathematical representations.
insights:
  - The Pythagorean theorem is a core principle for defining geometric relationships.
  - >-
    The theorem establishes a direct link between the sides of a right triangle and the concept of
    distance.
  - >-
    The mathematical relationship between the Pythagorean theorem and the distance formula is
    invariant.
  - >-
    LLM embeddings consistently represent these linked mathematical concepts in a similar geometric
    space.
  - >-
    Canonical neighbors highlight the theorem's role in geometry and its extensions like metric
    spaces.
