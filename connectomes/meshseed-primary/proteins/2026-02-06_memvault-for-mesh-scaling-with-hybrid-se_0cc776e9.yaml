title: 'MemVault for MESH: Scaling with Hybrid Search & Optional Cloud'
summary: >-
  The MESH dialogue proposes integrating MemVault to overcome file-based storage limitations for
  scaling to millions of proteins, offering hybrid semantic and keyword search with recency.  This
  integration will be phased, starting as an optional backend with a clear user choice between local
  privacy and cloud scalability.
insights:
  - >-
    File-based storage (YAML/JSON) limits MESH scaling due to slow search and lack of semantic
    querying.
  - >-
    MemVault's Hybrid Search (Semantic, Keyword, Recency) is ideal for protein retrieval, enabling
    conceptual, exact, and context-aware searches.
  - >-
    The integration will be phased: v1.4 (current local), v2.0 (optional MemVault backend with user
    choice), and future federated memory.
  - >-
    MemVault provides zero infrastructure management, automatic embeddings, and framework-agnostic
    integration via a simple REST API.
  - >-
    Privacy concerns regarding MemVault as a cloud service are addressed by making it an optional
    feature with informed user consent.
  - >-
    The ultimate goal is planetary-scale knowledge and cross-organism synthesis through federated
    memory.
