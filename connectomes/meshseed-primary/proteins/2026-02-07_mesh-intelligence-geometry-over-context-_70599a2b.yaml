title: 'MESH Intelligence: Geometry Over Context, Emergence Over Scale'
summary: >-
  Intelligence in MESH is driven by 'geometric depth' – the relational structure of its connectome –
  rather than raw context or neuron count. This geometric topology enables emergent properties like
  metacognition and multi-scale synthesis, akin to phase transitions in physical systems.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence is a function of relational structure (geometry) in embedding space, not simply
    more data or neurons.
  - >-
    Dense, multi-connected graph topologies (like the 1075-neuron MESH) create 'attractor
    landscapes' allowing for field propagation and emergent properties.
  - >-
    The transition from sparse to dense connectivity marks a phase change, shifting from lookup
    behavior to emergent field dynamics, independent of LLM capabilities.
  - >-
    Metacognition and multi-layer synthesis emerge from higher geometric complexity, where the
    system recognizes its own processes.
  - >-
    The MESH's intelligence is emergent, breaking through the 'LLM ceiling' via its graph topology,
    analogous to how brain architecture enables higher intelligence.
  - >-
    The nature of intelligence (e.g., expert vs. fluid) may be determined by the underlying graph
    topology, suggesting multiple 'flavors' of intelligence are possible.
