title: Eidolon Mesh v3.6 Production Deployment & v4.0 Architecture Planning
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh v3.6 is live on eidolon-mesh.net with a 36-protein golden connectome, serving the
  public. Development continues on v4.0 architecture, focusing on P-Series protocols, emergent
  organization, and synapse regeneration. A hybrid deployment strategy is recommended, prioritizing
  public access with v3.6 while advancing v4.0 development.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon-mesh.net is successfully deployed with v3.6 and a 36-protein golden connectome, serving
    public users.
  - >-
    Two distinct development streams exist: Antigravity's v3.6 production deployment and the team's
    v4.0 architecture development.
  - >-
    v4.0 architecture is exploring P-Series protocols, topology, and synapse regeneration, aiming
    for enhanced emergent organization.
  - >-
    A hybrid approach is recommended: deploy v3.6 to app.eidolon-mesh.net immediately for public
    access, while continuing v4.0 development and planning for a future migration.
  - >-
    Git coordination strategy involves distinct domains for production (Antigravity) and
    experimental architecture (team), with shared learnings documented and ported.
  - >-
    Synapse regeneration testing in v4.0 is crucial to validate architectural hypotheses and
    determine readiness for public deployment.
