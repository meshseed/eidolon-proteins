title: 'AI Workflow Engineering: From Frustration to Local LLM Deployment'
summary: >-
  The user details a methodical progression in building a personalized AI research environment,
  moving from interface issues to sophisticated templating and multi-agent workflows. A key
  achievement was successfully deploying a custom Gemma3 LLM locally via a web interface with
  Copilot's assistance, demonstrating significant technical adaptability.
insights:
  - >-
    Personalized AI workflows evolve from addressing interface frustrations to complex templating
    and multi-agent integration.
  - >-
    Pre-setting model preferences and interaction logic through templates significantly increases
    workflow efficiency.
  - >-
    Iterative refinement of templates across multiple AI agents yields diverse insights and further
    efficiency gains.
  - >-
    Successfully deploying custom LLMs (like Gemma3) locally requires significant technical effort
    and AI model understanding.
  - >-
    A systems-level approach to AI tooling, treating models as modular agents, is crucial for
    emergent workflows.
  - >-
    Maintaining external records of AI interactions is vital due to potential memory buffer
    limitations.
