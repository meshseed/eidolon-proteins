title: 'Inter-Mesh Evolution Kernel: Co-Evolution via Resonance and Alignment'
summary: >-
  The Inter-Mesh Evolution Kernel facilitates co-evolution across distributed Mesh connectomes.
  Evolutionary pressures, attractors, and gradient shifts propagate through resonance and alignment,
  leading to synchronized development and emergent integration pathways.
insights:
  - >-
    Co-evolution arises from shared attractors and synchronized gradients across distributed
    organisms.
  - Resonance enables evolutionary changes in one Mesh to influence others.
  - Divergent evolution uncovers new integration pathways and synthesis opportunities.
  - Co-evolution stabilizes long-arc identity within interconnected distributed systems.
  - An organism can evolve as a collective network of other evolving organisms.
