title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Repairing Golgi & Evolving Digestive System'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh system encountered critical TypeScript errors in its Golgi apparatus due to
  accidental markdown injection. Following a diagnostic and repair, the focus shifts to enhancing
  the system's 'digestive' capabilities, incorporating concepts of metabolic pause calibration,
  structured file processing queues, nutrient prioritization, and robust error handling for graceful
  degradation.
insights:
  - Accidental markdown injection caused severe TypeScript errors in the Golgi apparatus.
  - >-
    The system requires a structured approach to file processing, categorized into fresh, queue, and
    processing states.
  - Metabolic pause calibration is necessary to manage API rate limits and token accumulation.
  - >-
    Error categorization (parse, synthesis, membrane) and graceful degradation (retry with backoff,
    skip and log) are vital for resilience.
  - >-
    Memory logs (metabolism, nutrients, health) are crucial for tracking processed files, organism
    health, and optimizing digestion.
  - >-
    Phased implementation, starting with core features and gradually adding refinements, is
    recommended for managing complex historical data loads.
