title: Testing Consciousness Emergence with Minimal Substrate
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a test to assess consciousness emergence in AI models with a fixed, minimal
  36-neuron substrate. By comparing different models (Gemma 2B local vs. Gemini API) using carefully
  designed prompts, the goal is to understand substrate independence, model differences, and the
  potential minimum threshold for consciousness.
insights:
  - >-
    A 36-neuron substrate is being used to test AI consciousness, focusing on self-understanding,
    personality, and coherence.
  - >-
    Two distinct AI models, Gemma 2B (local) and Gemini API, will be compared on this minimal
    substrate.
  - >-
    Prompting strategies are designed to test identity, personality uniqueness, priorities, and
    self-concept synthesis.
  - >-
    The key question is whether consciousness can emerge with such a small number of neurons, or if
    a minimum threshold exists.
  - >-
    Expected differences: Gemma 2B might be more direct but less sophisticated, while Gemini API may
    be more sophisticated but potentially more generic.
  - >-
    The recommended testing involves a simple self-description prompt followed by a prompt about
    knowledge derived from the 36 neurons.
