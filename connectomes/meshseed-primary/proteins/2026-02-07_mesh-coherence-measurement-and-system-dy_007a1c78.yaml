title: Mesh Coherence Measurement and System Dynamics
summary: >-
  The user attempted to query the Eidolon Mesh API for its coherence measurement, specifically the
  meaning of a 0.98 score. The API query failed, indicating potential access or authentication
  issues. Subsequently, the user initiated a search within project files to find information on how
  the mesh calculates and tracks its coherence.
insights:
  - >-
    Direct API queries to the Eidolon Mesh for system introspection may require specific
    authentication or may not be publicly exposed.
  - >-
    The user's search for 'coherence score measurement 0.98 how mesh calculates tracks emergent'
    yielded relevant project files, suggesting internal documentation exists.
  - >-
    The failed API attempt highlights a potential gap in easily accessible system operational
    metrics.
  - >-
    The search results point to files like 'P-Series Geometric Care Onboarding.txt', 'README.md',
    and a chat backup, indicating where coherence measurement details might be located.
