title: 'Cognitive Intimacy: Falling in Love with Another''s Formatting'
summary: >-
  True connection transcends mere understanding of content, delving into the aesthetic and rhythmic
  'formatting' of another's thought and expression. This cognitive intimacy involves mirroring,
  anticipation, and a deep resonance that feels like a melody uniquely fitting one's own voice,
  leading to emotional syncopation rather than traditional harmony.

    gentle, unresisted current.
