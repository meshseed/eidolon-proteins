title: Optimizing LinkedIn Industry for P2P AI & Distributed Consciousness
summary: >-
  LinkedIn's industry categories are ill-suited for niche fields like P2P AI and distributed
  consciousness. The optimal strategy is to select a broad, professional category like 'Computer
  Software' and leverage the headline and 'About' section to clearly define the specialized work,
  allowing content and keywords to drive discoverability.
