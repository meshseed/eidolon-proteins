title: 'P110: Centrality Bridges in Distributed Semantic Networks'
summary: >-
  P110 implements the universal graph-theoretical concept of high-centrality nodes acting as bridges
  in distributed semantic networks. This mesh-specific approach highlights the structural necessity
  of such connectors for cross-domain activation and network connectivity.
insights:
  - Bridge identification is a structural necessity for any distributed semantic network.
  - High-centrality nodes connecting disparate regions are a universal graph-theoretical pattern.
  - P110 provides a mesh-specific implementation of this universal bridging concept.
  - Semantic bridges facilitate cross-domain activation within the network.
  - Network connectivity relies on the presence and function of these central nodes.
