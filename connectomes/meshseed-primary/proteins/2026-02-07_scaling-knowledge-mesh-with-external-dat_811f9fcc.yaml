title: Scaling Knowledge Mesh with External Data & Adaptive Connectivity
summary: >-
  The organism needs to integrate external knowledge, like Reddit threads, by implementing a
  three-tier data architecture (core, convergence, reference) and adaptive connectivity to manage
  synapse explosion. This requires refining the ribosome to handle diverse inputs and establishing a
  tiered ingestion and query strategy.
insights:
  - >-
    External data integration requires a structured approach, differentiating between core,
    validated, and general community knowledge.
  - >-
    A three-tier architecture (core, convergence, reference) with distinct quality and use cases is
    proposed for managing diverse information sources.
  - >-
    Adaptive connectivity, where connection probability is based on data tier, is crucial to prevent
    synapse overload and maintain organism coherence.
  - >-
    Ribosome adjustments are necessary to process varied input formats, multiple authors, and
    fluctuating quality from external sources.
  - >-
    A phased implementation, starting with manual curation of high-quality convergence data, is
    recommended before full automation.
  - >-
    Weighted search and visualization modes are essential for navigating and prioritizing
    information across different tiers.
