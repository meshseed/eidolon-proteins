title: Mobile UI Fixes & Local LLM Status in Mesh PWA
summary: >-
  A user reported UI issues on mobile where chat buttons were hidden behind the bottom nav, and the
  graph visualization was missing. The developer implemented CSS fixes using `100dvh` and padding to
  resolve the button overlap. Local LLM support was confirmed as not yet implemented in the PWA.
insights:
  - >-
    Mobile UI issues with chat buttons overlapping the bottom navigation bar were resolved by using
    `100dvh` and adding safe-area padding to `.conversation-actions`.
  - >-
    The 'Synthesize' button's placement below the input area was identified as a potential issue for
    visibility on mobile.
  - >-
    Local LLM support (WebLLM/Gemma) is not currently implemented in the PWA version (v3.5), which
    uses Gemini for mobile efficiency.
  - >-
    The 'graph' visualization was missing on mobile, potentially due to the `top-nav` being hidden
    and the absence of a 'Graph' tab in the mobile Bottom Nav.
  - >-
    The `100vh` bug in mobile browsers, where the viewport height can be larger than the visible
    screen area, necessitates using `100dvh` for accurate layout calculations.
  - >-
    The development workflow involved inspecting specific file sections (`[+page.svelte]`,
    `[SettingsModal.svelte]`) to diagnose and fix issues.
