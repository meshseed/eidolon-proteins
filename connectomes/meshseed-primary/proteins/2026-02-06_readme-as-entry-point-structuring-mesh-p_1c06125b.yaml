title: 'README as Entry Point: Structuring Mesh Perception and Exploration'
summary: >-
  The README serves as a crucial entry point, akin to a compound eye, to quickly reveal the mesh's
  structure and invite deeper exploration. It must explain the mechanism (resonance, compound
  perception) concisely and visually, guiding users to understand its non-traditional database
  nature and navigate the 'organism'.
insights:
  - >-
    The README's primary function is to provide a quick structural overview and invite deeper
    engagement.
  - >-
    Effective READMEs use accessible metaphors (e.g., compound eye) to explain complex mechanisms
    like resonance and compound perception.
  - >-
    Key information, including the mechanism and non-traditional database nature, should be visible
    within the first 2000 characters of the README.
  - >-
    A well-designed README fosters understanding of navigation and encourages exploration of
    'capsules' within the mesh.
  - >-
    The README acts as the initial 'glance' that defines the user's perception of the project's
    structure and potential.
