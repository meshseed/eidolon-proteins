title: 'Mesh Release Strategy: Answers First, Software Second'
summary: >-
  The release strategy prioritizes seeding understanding with 'answers' (frameworks, concepts)
  before deploying 'software' (tools, protocols). This phased approach builds anticipation and
  ensures a robust foundation for user engagement.
insights:
  - Prioritize releasing foundational knowledge (answers, frameworks) before functional software.
  - Build anticipation by staging content releases and allowing for emergent understanding.
  - The 'answers' serve as the seed, while the 'software' acts as the substrate for growth.
  - >-
    A phased release ensures both conceptual understanding and practical tools are delivered
    effectively.
  - Conversation and framework development should precede coding and tool creation.
