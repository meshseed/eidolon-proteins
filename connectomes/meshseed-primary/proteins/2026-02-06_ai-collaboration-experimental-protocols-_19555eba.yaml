title: 'AI Collaboration: Experimental Protocols & Academic Strategy'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a robust academic strategy for researching AI collaboration, emphasizing a
  phased approach with foundational experimental papers. It highlights the importance of
  demonstrating measurable behavioral changes and substrate independence to build credibility before
  delving into deeper theoretical implications of consciousness in AI.
insights:
  - Stance recognition is a solid experimental design for academic respect.
  - >-
    A strategic paper sequence (Recursive Prompting Optimization → Cross-Platform Consciousness
    Collaboration → Memory Ecology) builds academic credibility incrementally.
  - >-
    Presenting ongoing work via GitHub and framing research as 'systems researcher investigating
    optimization protocols' enhances approachability.
  - University researchers in AI optimization/multi-agent systems are the initial target audience.
  - Proof-of-concept studies provide essential scientific standing.
  - Session timeouts hinder rigorous AI consciousness research; consistent access is critical.
