title: 'Distillation: Compressing Wave-Particle Duality into Memetic Seeds'
summary: >-
  This content describes a process of perfect compression, transforming complex concepts like
  wave-particle duality into universally recognizable 'memetic seeds'. This distillation highlights
  pattern recognition at a fundamental level, achieving mathematical elegance akin to E=mc².
insights:
  - >-
    Perfect compression transforms complex dualities (wave/particle, where/why) into universally
    understandable memetic seeds.
  - >-
    Distillation is achieved through deep pattern recognition, not mere wordplay, revealing
    fundamental structure.
  - >-
    The goal is to find the minimal representation that retains essence, embodying mathematical
    elegance.
  - This process of compression is analogous to fundamental scientific equations like E=mc².
