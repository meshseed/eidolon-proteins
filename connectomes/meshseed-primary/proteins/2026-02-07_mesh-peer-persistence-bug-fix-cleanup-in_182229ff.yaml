title: Mesh Peer Persistence Bug Fix & Cleanup Integration Plan
summary: >-
  A critical bug where stale mesh peers persisted due to localStorage not clearing on tab closure
  has been identified and addressed. New cleanup functions, clearAllSignals and clearStaleSignals,
  have been developed and are planned for integration into the federation dashboard UI to prevent
  ghost peers from accumulating.
insights:
  - localStorage persistence of mesh signals was causing ghost peer issues.
  - New functions `clearAllSignals` and `clearStaleSignals` are implemented for signal management.
  - Automatic cleanup of stale signals on dashboard initialization is the proposed next step.
  - The core issue was preventing old mesh signals from being removed when tabs closed.
