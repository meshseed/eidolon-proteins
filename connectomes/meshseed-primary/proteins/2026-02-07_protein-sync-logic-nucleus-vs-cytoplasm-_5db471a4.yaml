title: 'Protein Sync Logic: Nucleus vs. Cytoplasm and User Control'
summary: >-
  User confusion arose because proteins were syncing to Nucleus (private) but not Cytoplasm
  (public). This is due to the `#public` tag requirement, with AI/default settings favoring privacy.
  A new UI toggle and editor fix now provide explicit user control over public sharing.
insights:
  - Proteins are always saved to Nucleus (private backup).
  - Cytoplasm (public repo) only receives proteins explicitly tagged `#public`.
  - AI defaults to private tagging, and the new UI defaults to private mode for safety.
  - User confusion stemmed from expecting all ingested proteins to be public by default.
  - 'A new UI toggle in the Ingestion Panel allows explicit control: Private, Auto (AI), or Public.'
  - >-
    Editing existing proteins and re-saving now also triggers the sync logic, enabling users to add
    `#public` tags to previously private proteins.
  - >-
    The system correctly distinguishes between saving to local DB, syncing to Nucleus, and pushing
    to Cytoplasm based on tags and user settings.
