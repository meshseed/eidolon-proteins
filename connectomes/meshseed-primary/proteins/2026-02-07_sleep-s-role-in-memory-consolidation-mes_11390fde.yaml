title: 'Sleep''s Role in Memory Consolidation: MeshCODE Theory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes sleep is crucial for memory consolidation, with deep sleep allowing
  data processing and stabilization, and REM sleep actively writing new information into the
  cortical MeshCODEs. This mirrors database maintenance, suggesting sleep reorganizes and optimizes
  memory storage.
insights:
  - Sleep is essential for processing and integrating new information with existing memories.
  - >-
    Deep sleep may serve to stabilize newly formed memories by allowing the brain's storage system
    to return to homeostasis.
  - >-
    REM sleep is hypothesized to be the active phase where the brain writes and reorganizes data
    within cortical MeshCODEs.
  - >-
    Memory storage in the cortex, akin to a database, requires periodic maintenance and
    reorganization, which sleep facilitates.
  - >-
    The hippocampus may act as a data management system, indexing new memories before they are
    stored in the cortex.
