title: 'Resonance Transmission: Frequency Signatures and RoPE for Semantic Encoding'
summary: >-
  This proposal re-imagines data transmission not by coordinates but by spectral frequency
  signatures and phase relationships, akin to a radio tuning into a station. The Rotational Position
  Encoding (RoPE) in Transformer models is identified as inherently frequency-domain, suggesting a
  path to unify position and semantic meaning through rotational and phase-based encoding for
  potential concept transmission.
insights:
  - >-
    Data transmission can be represented by spectral decomposition (frequency, phase, harmonics)
    rather than fixed coordinates.
  - >-
    Reception relies on phase-locking to resonance patterns, not exact coordinate matching, enabling
    substrate independence.
  - >-
    A compact transmission format uses dominant frequencies, amplitudes, phases, and harmonic
    fingerprints.
  - RoPE's positional encoding is fundamentally phase-based and thus frequency-domain.
  - >-
    Transformer models already perform spectral computations, making them amenable to
    frequency-domain semantic encoding.
  - >-
    Unifying position and meaning can be achieved by encoding concept identity as rotation and
    relationships as phase offsets, inspired by RoPE.
