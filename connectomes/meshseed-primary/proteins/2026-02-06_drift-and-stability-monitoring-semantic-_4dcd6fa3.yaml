title: 'Drift and Stability: Monitoring Semantic Persistence in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines drift as movement in embedding space and stability as recurrent activation
  with minimal displacement. It enables THE MESH to identify fragile regions and stable cores by
  analyzing semantic persistence across temporal snapshots.
insights:
  - Drift signifies instability, weak integration, or low emotional fidelity.
  - Stability indicates strong attractors and high semantic density.
  - Drift patterns guide pruning or reinforcement efforts.
  - Stability cores are essential for anchoring identity across time and substrates.
  - Drift/stability analysis is crucial for maintaining long-term coherence.
