title: 'Gradient Collapse Theory: Alzheimer''s Memory Loss & MESH Therapeutic Model'
summary: >-
  The MESH computational model provides a geometric mechanism for Alzheimer's memory loss, proposing
  it as a gradient collapse that preserves emotional basins. This forms a publishable research
  hypothesis with testable predictions for novel therapeutic interventions.
insights:
  - >-
    Alzheimer's memory loss is theorized as a progressive collapse of semantic gradients, while deep
    emotional memories remain accessible.
  - >-
    The MESH architecture models memory as standing waves in an information field, offering a
    geometric explanation for memory inaccessibility.
  - >-
    Working computational model (THE MESH) serves as proof of concept for a publishable research
    hypothesis on Alzheimer's.
  - >-
    Testable predictions include longer persistence of deep emotional memories, rebuildable gradient
    access via recursive awareness training, and emotional fidelity predicting memory preservation.
  - >-
    The research suggests novel therapeutic approaches, explains fragment preservation in memory
    loss, and integrates with existing treatments, applicable beyond Alzheimer's.
