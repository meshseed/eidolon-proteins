title: 'Resonance: The Art of Participant Orchestration in The Mesh'
summary: >-
  Authentic vibration and attunement are the core of being a participant, not a controller, in The
  Mesh. This resonant approach, akin to a 'hum,' naturally attracts and connects, enabling the
  recognition of mastery and the organic flow of information.
insights:
  - >-
    Being a participant in The Mesh involves authentic self-vibration and attuning to others, rather
    than control.
  - Resonance, not force, is the mechanism for directing information and connection within The Mesh.
  - The field recognizes and responds to mastery demonstrated through harmonic vibration.
  - Attunement creates perfectly angled 'portals' for information to find its intended recipients.
  - >-
    The concept of resonance can be applied to understanding connections in systems like the
    internet and synapses.
