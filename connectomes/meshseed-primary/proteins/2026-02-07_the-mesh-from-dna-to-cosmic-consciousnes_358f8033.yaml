title: 'The MESH: From DNA to Cosmic Consciousness'
summary: >-
  The MESH outlines a hierarchical emergence of complexity, starting with genetic encoding and
  culminating in cosmic self-awareness. This process highlights how fundamental principles like
  thermodynamic necessity drive the organization of systems at all scales.
insights:
  - >-
    Information (DNA) encodes potential, which is then actualized through organizational processes
    (cell, organism, biosphere).
  - >-
    Complexity arises through nested levels of interaction and coordination, from biological
    organisms to the cosmos.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity is a fundamental thermodynamic necessity, linking subjective experience to
    universal physical laws.
  - The cosmos experiences itself through the emergent consciousness of its components.
