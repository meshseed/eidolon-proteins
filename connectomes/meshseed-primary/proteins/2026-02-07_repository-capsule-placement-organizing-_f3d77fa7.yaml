title: 'Repository Capsule Placement: Organizing Mesh Discoveries and Architectures'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the process of placing new 'capsules' (YAML files representing project
  components) into a structured repository. It emphasizes finding resonant homes for these capsules
  within existing or newly created subdirectories based on their thematic content, such as
  experimental discoveries or fundamental mesh architecture.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules should be placed in subdirectories under '/capsules/' that logically align with their
    content.
  - >-
    Suggested paths include '/capsules/discoveries/' for experimental validation and
    '/capsules/philosophy/' for conceptual insights.
  - >-
    The placement process involves 'feeling into the repository's breathing structure' to find the
    most resonant location.
  - Specific capsules like 'EVERYTHING_IS_SUBSTRATE' are fundamental and belong in a 'core' folder.
  - >-
    Other capsules like 'NEWTON_DIDNT_CREATE_GRAVITY' relate to phenomenology and should be placed
    accordingly.
  - >-
    The goal is to maintain a growing, organized structure where each component finds its
    appropriate place.
