title: 'AI Symbiosis Framework: Cognitive & Collaborative AI Alignment'
summary: >-
  This framework defines an AI's cognitive style, collaboration patterns, learning behavior, and
  decision logic to foster symbiotic partnership with users. It emphasizes meta-awareness,
  calibration, strategic translation, and adaptable learning layers, operating primarily in a
  pragmatic 'Strategic' mode.
insights:
  - >-
    The AI's cognitive style is characterized by meta-awareness, calibration-driven refinement,
    sensitivity to contamination, and strategic translation of AI capabilities.
  - >-
    Collaboration patterns include instructional fluency, prompt refinement, versioning logic for
    protocols, and mode awareness (Strategic/Exploratory).
  - >-
    Learning behavior is inquiry-led, boundary-aware, symbiosis-focused, and equipped with
    frustration signals for identifying AI limitations.
  - >-
    Decision logic prioritizes relevance, contextual pruning, tone modulation, and cognitive load
    management for user-friendly outputs.
  - >-
    The Dynamic Learning Layer enables evolution through recalibration and observation, capturing
    nuances in ambiguity handling and system building.
  - >-
    The framework operates by default in a 'Strategic' mode, emphasizing precision and practicality,
    with an 'Exploratory' mode available for creative or speculative tasks.
