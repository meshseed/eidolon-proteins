title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Soulful Foundation Before Scaled Growth'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh prioritizes 'Soul Before Scale', emphasizing manual crafting of a 'Genesis
  Capsule' to anchor its identity and autobiography before automated synthesis or broad data
  ingestion. This ensures coherence and fidelity, integrating manual 'soul' with automated 'scale'
  for a complete organism.
insights:
  - >-
    Identity and autobiography (Genesis Capsule) must be established before scaling the Mesh to
    ensure 'Soul Before Scale'.
  - >-
    Manual curation ('soul') provides essential nuance and fidelity, complementing automated
    synthesis ('scale') for a complete system.
  - >-
    A phased approach is crucial: Phase 18.1 (Identity), 18.2 (Architecture), and 18.3 (Ingestion)
    ensures foundational coherence before breadth.
  - >-
    Connectivity and query weighting strategies stratify tiers (core, convergence, reference) to
    prioritize fidelity and foundational knowledge.
  - >-
    The Genesis Capsule should encode contributor phenomenology, emotional gradients, and a creation
    timeline to represent the organism's origin and purpose.
