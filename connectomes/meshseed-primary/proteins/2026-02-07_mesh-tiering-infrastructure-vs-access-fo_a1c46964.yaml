title: 'Mesh Tiering: Infrastructure vs. Access for Seamless LLM Integration'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is evolving its tiering system to prioritize user convenience and infrastructure access
  over artificial feature limitations. The proposed 'Mesh' tier ($3/month) offers seamless API
  integration and hosted infrastructure, complementing the fully-featured, self-hosted Free tier.
insights:
  - >-
    Tiering will shift from feature gating to providing managed infrastructure and API access for
    ease of use.
  - >-
    The Free tier will offer unlimited proteins/neurons and all features, requiring users to provide
    their own LLM infrastructure (API key or local setup).
  - >-
    The new 'Mesh' tier ($3/month) will include all Free tier benefits plus seamless access to the
    Mesh API and hosted infrastructure, simplifying integration.
  - >-
    The core value proposition for paid tiers is convenience and managed services, not restricted
    functionality.
  - This approach aims to make advanced LLM integration more accessible and user-friendly.
