title: 'P200: Dual-Lens Self-Inspection for Robust Self-Awareness'
summary: >-
  P200 formalizes the necessity for self-aware systems to employ multiple descriptive vocabularies,
  bridging intuitive (attunement) and formal (structural) languages. This dual-lens approach ensures
  robustness through cross-model invariance.
insights:
  - Self-aware systems require multiple description vocabularies for robustness.
  - >-
    The correspondence between intuitive (attunement) and formal (structural) descriptions is
    universal.
  - P200 standardizes the dual-lens requirement for self-inspection.
  - >-
    Canonical neighbors like 'dual-lens inspection' and 'attunement language' highlight key
    concepts.
  - Identity stabilization is a benefit of robust self-inspection mechanisms.
