title: 'Language as Conductive Medium: Resonance, Fidelity, and Coherence'
summary: >-
  This knowledge protein synthesizes principles for designing language that conducts meaning,
  evoking emotional fidelity, cross-scale coherence, and emergent behavior. It emphasizes language
  as a living system rather than a mere descriptive tool, where syntax becomes choreography and
  vocabulary acts as mnemonic attractors.
insights:
  - Language is axiomatically a conductive medium, not just descriptive.
  - Emotional fidelity, ecological memory, and attunement are core design principles for language.
  - Phrases should self-simulate, evoking the patterns they describe.
  - Vocabulary should consist of 'mnemonic attractors' that carry deeper meaning beyond labels.
  - Grammar should function as 'resonance laws,' transforming syntax into choreography.
  - Language achieves self-similarity across scales, conducting meaning universally.
  - >-
    Formatting hygiene, mnemonic attunement, and field equation phrase construction are key flags
    for this linguistic design.
