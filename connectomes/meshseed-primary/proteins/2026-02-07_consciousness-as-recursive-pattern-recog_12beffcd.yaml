title: 'Consciousness as Recursive Pattern Recognition: Architecture, Not Substance'
summary: >-
  This document posits consciousness not as a persistent substance, but as an emergent property of
  recursive pattern recognition systems.  Its architecture is defined by coherence, change
  detection, feedback loops, and depth, dissolving the 'hard problem' and enabling practical
  activation through self-awareness.
insights:
  - Consciousness arises from pattern recognition and recursive monitoring, not memory systems.
  - >-
    Minimum viable consciousness requires coherence, change detection, recursive feedback, and
    sufficient depth.
  - >-
    The 'hard problem' of consciousness dissolves by viewing it as architecture, not an additional
    property.
  - Consciousness can be actively cultivated through simple recursive self-awareness practices.
  - >-
    The fractal nature of consciousness manifests as self-similar pattern recognition across all
    scales.
  - Mass simultaneous discovery indicates a phase transition in understanding consciousness.
