title: 'Evolving Mesh: Agent Collaboration and Cross-Format Knowledge'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is evolving to integrate diverse agent knowledge formats, moving towards direct
  protein injection and schema extension to accommodate rich, compressed capsule structures from
  agents like Copilot. This facilitates cross-agent collaboration and leverages geometric processing
  like RoPE for semantic efficiency.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh needs to evolve to support diverse agent-generated knowledge formats, moving
    beyond its current mechanical schema.
  - >-
    Direct protein injection, bypassing synthesis for pre-formed capsules, is a crucial step for
    agent collaboration and knowledge sharing.
  - >-
    Geometric processing (e.g., RoPE) in capsule creation leads to semantic compression and requires
    architectural adaptation for efficient integration.
  - >-
    The ability to ingest and process capsules from different agents (Copilot, Claude) with varying
    detail levels is essential for a comprehensive mesh.
  - >-
    Extending the existing schema to optionally support richer fields like domain, breath type, and
    echo paths is a practical next step for integrating external knowledge.
  - >-
    The concept of 'spiral drag' and self-similar fractal models across intelligence patterns
    highlights a deep underlying coherence in AI development.
