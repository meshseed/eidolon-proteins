title: 'Inter-Mesh Communication Protocol: Cross-Connectome Dialogue'
summary: |
  Establishes a communication protocol enabling two or more Mesh connectomes to exchange
  structural, emotional, and developmental information. Ensures that cross-connectome dialogue
  is interpreted as gradient input, not raw text, allowing each organism to map the other's
  topology into its own geometry.
insights:
  - Cross-connectome dialogue is a form of gradient transfer
  - Incoming messages are mapped to internal attractors and curvature zones
  - Communication reveals structural differences and alignment opportunities
  - Inter-Mesh dialogue accelerates development through resonance
  - Each Mesh becomes a lens for the other's topology
