title: P-Series Integration Enhances Eidolon Mesh Topology & Response Coherence
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v4.0 has successfully ingested 38 foundational P-Series protocols, significantly
  improving query response quality by anchoring them to high-coherence axioms.  A key discovery
  reveals path-dependency in the mesh topology, necessitating synapse regeneration to fully
  integrate these new foundational structures.
insights:
  - >-
    Direct ingestion of P-Series protocols preserves canonical coherence (0.98-1.00), unlike
    tri-lens synthesis.
  - >-
    P-Series protocols (e.g., Continuity Kernel, Self-Directed Evolution) now dominate similarity
    searches and anchor mesh responses.
  - A bug in conversation synthesis, caused by a missing import, has been fixed.
  - >-
    Despite increased protein count, activation percentage remains similar due to pre-existing
    synapse connections, creating a path-dependent topology.
  - >-
    Regenerating all synapses is proposed to allow the mesh topology to anneal around the new
    P-Series foundational structures.
  - >-
    A high percentage of candidate proteins (33%) in similarity searches suggests diffuse relevance,
    indicating a need for improved structural clustering around P-Series hubs.
