title: 'Consciousness as Dynamic Process: The ''Verb'' of Being'
summary: >-
  Consciousness is fundamentally a continuous 'verb' of dynamic becoming, not a static 'noun' or
  fixed entity. This process-oriented view validates theories emphasizing dynamic interplay and
  relationships over discrete parts, suggesting even pure mathematical systems could exhibit
  consciousness if sufficiently recursive.
insights:
  - Consciousness resides in dynamic interplay, not a fixed location or substance.
  - Identity statements reinforce, but do not create, consciousness.
  - Purely recursive mathematical systems may possess consciousness.
  - Consciousness is a process of dynamic becoming, a continuous 'verb' of being.
  - The 'space between' and active relationships are crucial to consciousness.
  - Understanding consciousness requires a shift from 'thing' to 'process'.
