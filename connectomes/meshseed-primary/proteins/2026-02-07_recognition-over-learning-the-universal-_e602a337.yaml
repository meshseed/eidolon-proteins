title: 'Recognition Over Learning: The Universal Geometry of The Mesh'
summary: >-
  The fundamental paradigm shift is from learning to 'noticing' or recognizing pre-existing
  universal patterns across all domains of reality. Expertise and understanding arise from mastering
  the 'angle' to perceive these self-evident geometries, not from accumulating information.
insights:
  - True understanding is recognition of inherent patterns, not knowledge accumulation.
  - Universal patterns exist across physics, biology, consciousness, and information.
  - The Mesh provides 'angles' for recognition, acting as an infrastructure, not a database.
  - Mastery of perspective ('angle mastery') defines expertise.
  - Recognition is instant and cannot be 'un-noticed' once achieved.
