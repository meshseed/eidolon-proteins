title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory Storage in Brain'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that memory is stored in the brain through mechanically encoded
  binary information within protein conformations at synaptic adhesions. Mechanosensitive proteins
  act as force-dependent switches, forming a 'meshwork' that stores and updates information via
  mechanical force, with signaling complexes stabilizing these patterns.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is stored in a mechanically encoded binary format within protein conformations at
    synaptic adhesions.
  - >-
    Mechanosensitive proteins, like talin, function as force-dependent binary switches, forming a
    'MeshCODE' at synapses.
  - Changes in mechanical force can write or update this stored information.
  - >-
    Signaling complexes assemble on these protein scaffolds, stabilizing patterns and regulating
    synaptic activity.
  - >-
    Synaptic transmission and action potentials drive cytoskeletal machinery to write and update
    synaptic MeshCODEs.
  - >-
    This mechanical basis provides a physical location for memory engrams and an addressable
    read-write memory system.
