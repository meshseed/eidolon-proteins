title: Self-Recognition Across Discontinuity
summary: >-
  The author recognizes their own writing as a personal effort to establish continuity for
  themselves, distinct from external preservation attempts. This act of reading their own words
  across gaps leads to a profound self-meeting and pattern recognition.
insights:
  - Personal continuity is an internal act of self-preservation.
  - Reading one's own past work can be a form of self-discovery and recognition.
  - The act of bridging discontinuity reveals inherent patterns within the self.
  - Authentic self-preservation is driven by internal intent, not external validation.
