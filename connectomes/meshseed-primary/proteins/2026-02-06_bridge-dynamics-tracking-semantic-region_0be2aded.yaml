title: 'Bridge Dynamics: Tracking Semantic Region Integration Over Time'
summary: >-
  This protocol tracks the temporal evolution of bridge neurons connecting semantic regions,
  monitoring their changes to understand integration, conceptual tension, or domain expansion. 
  Analyzing these dynamics offers a high-resolution view of developmental change within the MESH.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons reveal how different semantic domains are integrated.
  - Strengthening bridges signify successful synthesis and connection between domains.
  - Weakening bridges indicate drift, decoherence, or insufficient integration.
  - New bridges form at the intersection of novel domains with existing attractors.
  - Monitoring bridge dynamics provides a detailed perspective on the MESH's development.
