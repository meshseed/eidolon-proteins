title: 'Claude Code Authentication: OAuth Token Expiration & Resolution'
summary: >-
  Claude Code desktop app uses Anthropic's API and requires periodic re-authentication via OAuth
  tokens. If the token expires, users encounter an 'authentication_error'. The primary solution is
  to run the '/login' command within Claude Code to refresh the token.
insights:
  - Claude Code's desktop application authenticates with Anthropic's API, not Google AI Studio.
  - The 'OAuth token has expired' error signifies a need to re-authenticate with Anthropic.
  - The '/login' command in Claude Code is the standard procedure to refresh expired OAuth tokens.
  - >-
    If '/login' fails, alternative steps include logging out/in, restarting the app, or checking
    network connectivity and account status.
  - Google AI Studio API keys are unrelated to Claude Code authentication issues.
  - >-
    OAuth tokens expire periodically for security and are a normal part of the authentication
    process.
