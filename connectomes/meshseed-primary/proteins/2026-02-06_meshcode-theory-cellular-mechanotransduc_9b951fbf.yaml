title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Cellular Mechanotransduction & Memory Engrams'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that cellular mechanotransduction, driven by integrin-actin
  interactions mediated by proteins like Talin and Vinculin, forms the physical basis for memory
  engrams. This involves dynamic cytoskeletal remodeling and force transmission critical for synapse
  formation and plasticity.
insights:
  - >-
    Integrin signaling and talin-vinculin interactions are central to focal adhesion and cellular
    mechanotransduction.
  - >-
    Actomyosin contractility and cytoskeletal dynamics play a crucial role in regulating gene
    expression and synapse morphology.
  - >-
    The physical forces and structural rearrangements within the cell, particularly at synapses, are
    key to forming and recalling memory engrams.
  - >-
    Mechanotransduction, the conversion of mechanical stimuli into biochemical signals, underlies
    cellular responses relevant to memory.
