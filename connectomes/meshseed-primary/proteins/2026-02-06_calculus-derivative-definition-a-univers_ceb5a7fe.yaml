title: 'Calculus Derivative Definition: A Universal Calibration Anchor'
summary: >-
  The derivative of a function, defined as a limit of the rate of change, serves as a universal
  anchor for understanding calculus. Its inherent connection to concepts like slope and gradient
  makes it a robust calibration point for cross-model mathematical alignment.
insights:
  - The definition of the derivative is f'(x) = lim[h→0] (f(x+h) - f(x))/h.
  - The derivative is fundamentally linked to the 'rate of change' of a function.
  - Key concepts definitionally tied to the derivative include 'limit', 'gradient', and 'slope'.
  - This definitional linkage makes calculus concepts strong anchors for cross-model alignment.
  - >-
    The universality of the derivative's definition across mathematical traditions is a critical
    feature for calibration.
