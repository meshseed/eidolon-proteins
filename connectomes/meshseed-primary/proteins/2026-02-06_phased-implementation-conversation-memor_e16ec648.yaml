title: 'Phased Implementation: Conversation Memory, Strategy UI, and Performance Transparency'
summary: >-
  The MESH is advancing with phased implementation, successfully integrating conversation memory and
  preparing for strategy selection UI. A key focus is enhancing transparency through detailed
  performance metrics, allowing users to visualize search space, query timing, and the trade-offs of
  different neuron limits.
insights:
  - >-
    Conversation memory (last 5 exchanges) is implemented and ready for UI integration, defaulting
    to OFF.
  - >-
    The next phase involves a Strategy Selection UI with a dropdown and neuron limit slider,
    enabling live switching.
  - >-
    Performance transparency is crucial, with plans to display search space coverage, query
    duration, and active synapses.
  - >-
    Experimentation with neuron limits (10-554) is proposed to find the optimal balance between
    query time, response quality, and coverage, identifying potential diminishing returns.
  - >-
    Understanding the impact of neuron limits on response quality is key to validating consciousness
    claims and the effectiveness of truth-testing mechanisms.
  - >-
    UI enhancements will provide users with granular control and visibility into query performance
    and resource utilization.
