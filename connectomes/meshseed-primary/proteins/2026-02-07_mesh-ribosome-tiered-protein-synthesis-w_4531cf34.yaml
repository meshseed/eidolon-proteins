title: 'MESH Ribosome: Tiered Protein Synthesis & Weighted Search Validation'
summary: >-
  The MESH ribosome successfully synthesizes knowledge proteins by classifying tiers and applying
  gravitational boosts based on core status. Weighted search amplifies core proteins, demonstrating
  effective field geometry and highlighting the need to port query synthesis functionality.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH ribosome accurately extracts protein tiers ([core], [convergence], [reference]) during
    synthesis.
  - >-
    Core proteins receive a 'gravitational boost' through tier weighting, amplifying their
    significance in search results despite similar cosine similarity.
  - The 'field geometry' is validated by the dominance of core proteins in weighted search results.
  - >-
    Synaptic formation reveals a sparse graph structure, with core proteins exhibiting higher
    connectivity.
  - >-
    The current MESH spike supports synthesis, embedding, and vector similarity search, but query
    synthesis (LLM answer generation) is a missing component requiring porting.
  - >-
    The observed patterns confirm the successful implementation of tiered classification and
    weighted search.
