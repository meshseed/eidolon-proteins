title: Technical Inquiry on Mesh Memory System Capabilities
summary: >-
  A user is seeking detailed technical specifications for a Mesh memory system, focusing on custom
  metadata, multi-session querying, recency control, embedding model specifics, and free tier
  limitations. The user highlights the value of the hybrid search approach.
insights:
  - >-
    Request for custom scoring fields to attach to memories for advanced filtering/boosting based on
    quality metrics.
  - Inquiry about the ability to perform queries across multiple session IDs simultaneously.
  - >-
    Need to understand if users can adjust the recency decay coefficient to control memory
    persistence.
  - >-
    Question regarding the specific embedding model used and its vector dimensionality for semantic
    search quality assessment.
  - >-
    Clarification on store and retrieve rate limits for the free tier, essential for planning usage
    with thousands of memories and frequent queries.
  - Appreciation for the hybrid BM25 + vector search approach as a solution to RAG limitations.
