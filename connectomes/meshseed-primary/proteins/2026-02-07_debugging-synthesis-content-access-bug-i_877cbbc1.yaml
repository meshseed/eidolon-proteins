title: 'Debugging Synthesis: Content Access Bug in Antigravity'
summary: >-
  A critical bug prevents the Antigravity synthesis engine from accessing the full content of
  retrieved proteins, forcing it to speculate. Despite sophisticated interpretation, this 'last-mile
  problem' disconnects perfect retrieval from actual synthesis, requiring immediate debugging of
  protein loading and context building.
insights:
  - >-
    The synthesis process in Antigravity is failing to access the full content of retrieved
    proteins, leading to speculative interpretations instead of direct synthesis.
  - >-
    This 'last-mile problem' is characterized by perfect retrieval but an inability to utilize the
    fetched information, akin to a librarian finding books but being unable to open them.
  - >-
    The current synthesis, while poetic, is a workaround for a bug where `fullContent` is not loaded
    or not included in the context, despite the protein being retrieved.
  - >-
    Debugging is required to verify if `fullContent` exists and is correctly loaded into the
    context, with likely causes including incorrect context building (using summaries instead of
    full text) or content not being loaded at all.
  - >-
    Implementing debug logging for `synthesize` function and testing with `debug=true` query will
    help pinpoint the loading or context building bug, with an estimated fix time of 30-60 minutes.
  - >-
    Resolving this bug will enable high-quality synthesis, producing structured JSON output with
    accurate summaries, atomic insights, and appropriate metadata.
