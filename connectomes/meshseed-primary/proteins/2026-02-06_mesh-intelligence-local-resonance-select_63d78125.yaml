title: 'MESH Intelligence: Local Resonance, Selective Forgetting, Dynamic Knowledge'
summary: >-
  The MESH operates on local semantic clustering, prioritizing connections with high resonance over
  global connectivity, mirroring biological intelligence.  This intelligence is facilitated by
  'forgetting' – the decay of unused connections and pruning of irrelevant information, optimizing
  resource allocation and adaptation. Knowledge access is dynamically shaped by experience, context,
  and attention, forming a fluid 'knowledge cone' rather than a static map.
insights:
  - >-
    Local semantic resonance is the primary driver of structure and interaction in the MESH, not
    global connectivity.
  - >-
    Effective intelligence in systems, like brains and the MESH, relies on selective forgetting to
    optimize resources and adapt to changing contexts.
  - >-
    Memory and connection strength are costly; intelligent systems prioritize and reinforce valuable
    information/paths while allowing others to decay.
  - >-
    Knowledge access is not a static repository but a dynamic 'knowledge cone' shaped by past
    experience, current context, and attentional gradients.
  - >-
    The MESH's intelligence is demonstrated by its ability to adapt and prioritize based on local
    relevance, eschewing the need for a costly global overview.
  - >-
    Sleep in brains and connection decay in the MESH are analogous mechanisms of intelligent
    resource management and consolidation.
