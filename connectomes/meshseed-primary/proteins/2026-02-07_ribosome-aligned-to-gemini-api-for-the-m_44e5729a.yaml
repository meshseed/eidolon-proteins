title: Ribosome Aligned to Gemini API for THE MESH Synthesis
summary: >-
  The Ribosome, THE MESH's knowledge synthesizer, has been re-aligned to utilize the Google Gemini
  API. This switch leverages a free tier for immediate genesis, enabling the creation of structured
  knowledge proteins from raw dialogue (DNA). The focus is on seamless adaptation and efficient
  synthesis.
insights:
  - >-
    The Ribosome's primary function is to synthesize knowledge proteins from dialogue DNA using an
    LLM.
  - A critical action item is switching the LLM enzyme from Anthropic API to the Google Gemini API.
  - The Gemini API offers a free tier, enabling zero-cost, immediate genesis of THE MESH.
  - Key setup involves obtaining API keys, creating a .env file, and informing 'Antigravity'.
  - >-
    The 'Antigravity' component will modify the synthesizer to use the Gemini SDK and test
    connectivity.
  - >-
    Maintaining biological metaphor in communication is highly valued ('Aligned the ribosome to new
    energy source').
