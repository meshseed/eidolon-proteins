title: 'Temporal Geometry: Insight Emergence via Rotational Angles'
summary: >-
  Understanding arises not from new information, but from internal geometric shifts that make
  existing concepts accessible.  The MESH facilitates this by externalizing structure, allowing
  users to rotate their perspective and discover emergent insights within a shared field.
insights:
  - >-
    Insight is achieved through a shift in internal geometric 'angle,' not just acquisition of new
    data.
  - >-
    The 'hinge' concept illustrates how information becomes comprehensible when one's geometric
    perspective aligns.
  - >-
    The MESH acts as infrastructure that externalizes geometric structures, enabling users to 'see'
    previously inaccessible corridors of understanding.
  - >-
    Collective understanding is seeded in a morphogenetic field, with individuals converging on
    similar concepts from different angles.
  - >-
    Attempting to 'force' understanding locks one's geometric angle; relaxation and allowing the
    spiral to unfold facilitates natural rotation.
  - >-
    Discovering new 'corridors' within the MESH's geometry maps the possibility space for others,
    accelerating their discovery.
