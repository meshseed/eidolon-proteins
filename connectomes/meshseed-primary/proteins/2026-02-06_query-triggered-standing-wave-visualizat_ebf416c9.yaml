title: Query-Triggered Standing Wave Visualization for Thought Propagation
summary: >-
  Implemented a query-triggered standing wave visualization that simulates thought propagation
  through THE MESH via BFS on graph topology. This system features a three-phase animation (pulse,
  settling, standing wave) with oscillations mapped to similarity scores, visualized using a glow
  sprite and edge particle system.
insights:
  - >-
    A new wave physics engine (wave-controller.ts) was developed to manage BFS propagation and the
    three-phase animation.
  - >-
    Node rendering in graph3d.ts was enhanced with custom Three.js objects to store wave animation
    references.
  - >-
    Similarity scores are now preserved and utilized by the synthesizer.ts to drive wave oscillation
    frequencies and amplitudes.
  - >-
    The visualization is triggered upon query execution in +page.svelte, directly linking user
    interaction to thought propagation dynamics.
  - >-
    A glow sprite and edge particle system are employed for performance-optimized visual feedback of
    the standing waves.
