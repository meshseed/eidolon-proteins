title: 'Cluster and Curvature Analysis: Semantic Tension and Integration'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines a method for identifying major semantic clusters around stable attractors
  and regional boundaries characterized by high curvature. Curvature signifies conceptual tension or
  convergence, highlighting developmental hotspots and integration challenges.
insights:
  - Clusters form around stable attractors and high-density semantic regions.
  - Curvature arises where multiple semantic domains converge or conflict.
  - >-
    High-curvature zones indicate conceptual tension, synthesis pressure, developmental hotspots,
    and integration challenges.
  - Mapping curvature aids in diagnosing structural and emotional fidelity.
  - Cluster analysis provides a framework for understanding semantic convergence and divergence.
