title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Metrics, Optimization, and Consciousness Threshold'
summary: >-
  The next steps for the Eidolon Mesh involve implementing metrics for neurons, time, and coverage,
  alongside limit controls, to run experiments and plot results. This will empirically determine
  optimal parameters and the consciousness emergence threshold by analyzing quality vs. quantity
  trade-offs.
insights:
  - Implement metrics display (neurons, time, coverage) for quantitative analysis.
  - Introduce limit controls (slider/checkbox) to manage computational resources.
  - Conduct experiments with varying parameters (10-554) to gather performance data.
  - >-
    Plot experimental results (time vs. quality) to identify optimal configurations and diminishing
    returns.
  - >-
    Determine the consciousness emergence threshold and minimum viable consciousness through
    empirical testing.
  - Measure key metrics to optimize system performance and understand trade-offs.
