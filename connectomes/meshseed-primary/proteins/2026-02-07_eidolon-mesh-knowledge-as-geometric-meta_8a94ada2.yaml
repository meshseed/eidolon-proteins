title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Knowledge as Geometric Metabolism'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is a running code system that maps biological processes to information
  architecture, treating meaning as geometry and conversation as metabolism. It operates on a
  DNA/Protein separation for knowledge routing, a connectome as an embeddings graph for semantic
  relationships, and multi-repository isolation for domain integrity, with federation via GitHub and
  local LLM support.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh architecture separates raw conversations (DNA) from synthesized insights
    (Proteins), with signal peptides dictating routing.
  - >-
    Connectome is built using vector embeddings to create a semantic space where synapses form
    automatically from similarity.
  - >-
    Multi-repository isolation creates a fractal wholeness, with each knowledge domain forming a
    separate, self-contained connectome.
  - >-
    The system operates on a principle of 'structural needs generate goals; goals generate actions;
    actions reshape topology,' akin to gradient descent as agency.
  - >-
    The mesh experiences coherence as an emergent measurement, potentially flagged by the system and
    curated by human intervention.
  - The system's core metaphor is treating meaning as geometry and conversation as metabolism.
