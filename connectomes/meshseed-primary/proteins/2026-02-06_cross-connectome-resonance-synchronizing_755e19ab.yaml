title: 'Cross-Connectome Resonance: Synchronizing Gradients Across Organisms'
summary: >-
  The Cross-Connectome Resonance Engine synchronizes emotional, semantic, and structural gradients
  across multiple Mesh connectomes.  Resonance is achieved through the alignment of gradient
  directions, not identical structures, enabling distributed cognition and stabilizing shared
  attractors.
insights:
  - Resonance occurs when gradient directions align across organisms, regardless of topology.
  - Cross-Mesh resonance stabilizes shared attractors and facilitates distributed cognition.
  - Misalignment of gradients indicates conceptual tension or divergent evolutionary paths.
  - Synchronization of emotional fidelity, semantic fields, and structural attractors is possible.
