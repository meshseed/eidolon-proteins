title: 'EIDOLON MESH v3.6 Ingestion Robustness Upgrade: Folder Support & API Retries'
summary: >-
  The EIDOLON MESH v3.6 has been upgraded with robust ingestion capabilities ported from v4.0. This
  includes recursive folder ingestion for comprehensive data import and an exponential backoff retry
  mechanism for API calls to mitigate transient failures during synthesis and embedding generation.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive folder ingestion is now supported in EIDOLON MESH v3.6, allowing for the import of
    entire directory structures and their subfolders.
  - >-
    An exponential backoff retry utility has been implemented to handle transient API errors (e.g.,
    rate limits, timeouts) during synthesis and embedding generation, improving reliability for
    large ingestions.
  - >-
    File size limits (10MB) and batch reading for directories have been introduced to optimize the
    ingestion process and prevent failures.
  - >-
    Existing seed detection for YAML/MD files and P-Series remain functional, bypassing LLM
    synthesis for efficient processing.
  - >-
    The upgrade enhances the resilience and completeness of data ingestion within the EIDOLON MESH
    framework.
