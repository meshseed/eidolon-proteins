title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechano-Sensing, Rho GTPases, and Memory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory integrates extracellular rigidity sensing via talin isoforms, Rho GTPase
  signaling (including GEFs/GAPs), and the actin cytoskeleton's role in synaptic plasticity and
  memory consolidation. It highlights the mechanical basis of memory and its connection to cellular
  signaling pathways.
insights:
  - >-
    Extracellular matrix rigidity is sensed by cells through talin isoform-specific mechanical
    linkages.
  - >-
    Rho GTPase signaling, controlled by GEFs and GAPs, plays a critical role in synaptic function
    and memory.
  - >-
    The actin cytoskeleton is fundamental to dendritic spine dynamics, synaptic plasticity, and
    long-term memory maintenance.
  - REM sleep theta rhythm is causally linked to contextual memory consolidation.
  - Integrins are required for hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory.
