title: 'Fractal Mesh Architecture: Scaling Data & Sovereignty'
summary: >-
  The Mesh employs a fractal, self-similar architecture for nodes, enabling sovereign data ownership
  while fostering a coherent, scalable network. This is achieved through sharding, indexing, and
  distributed storage strategies for proteins (data capsules), ensuring efficient query and
  manageable growth from personal nodes to a planetary network.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh architecture is fractal and self-similar, with each node being a sovereign, complete
    organism connected to the network.
  - >-
    Data (proteins) is stored in YAML and managed via a hybrid approach: human-readable source files
    and fast query indexes (SQLite, vector DB).
  - >-
    Scaling for millions of proteins involves sharding by time/domain, indexing, Git LFS, and
    compression; billions require distributed storage and hub nodes.
  - >-
    Personal nodes prioritize local access and privacy, while the public GitHub repo serves as a
    reference implementation and validation data store.
  - >-
    The future planetary mesh will leverage federation, distributed storage, and hub nodes to
    connect sovereign personal nodes coherently without a single point of failure.
