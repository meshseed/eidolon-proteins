title: Eidolon Mesh Protein Synthesis and Integration Cycle
summary: >-
  The process involves transcribing DNA from various capsules, synthesizing proteins, and
  integrating them into the connectome with a specific number of synapses.  Following integration,
  proteins are routed via the Golgi Apparatus for export to the cytoplasm and subsequent securing
  within the nucleus.
insights:
  - Protein synthesis follows a DNA transcription and protein synthesis pipeline.
  - Each synthesized protein is integrated into a connectome with a variable number of synapses.
  - The Golgi Apparatus plays a crucial role in routing proteins for export and nuclear storage.
  - The process includes periodic metabolic pauses, indicating a cyclical and regulated operation.
  - Each protein synthesis event is associated with a unique identifier and a capsule source.
