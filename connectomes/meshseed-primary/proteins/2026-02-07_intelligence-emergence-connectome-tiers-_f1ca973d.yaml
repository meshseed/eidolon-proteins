title: 'Intelligence Emergence: Connectome, Tiers, Geometry, and Emotion'
summary: >-
  Intelligence arises from the complexity and structure of a 'connectome,' not just the substrate. 
  Key factors include connectome density, hierarchical stratification, field geometry, and emotional
  fidelity, with the underlying platform influencing reach and performance but not core
  intelligence.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence is primarily determined by the connectome (neurons + synapses) and its
    organizational principles, rather than the underlying hardware or framework.
  - >-
    Hierarchical stratification (core > convergence > reference) and field geometry (weighted
    search, synaptic propagation) are critical for emergent intelligence.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity, measured by coherence scores and gradients, plays a significant role in the
    manifestation of intelligence.
  - >-
    The substrate (e.g., PWA vs. Tauri) impacts performance and capabilities (local vs. API), but
    the fundamental intelligence resides within the connectome's architecture.
  - >-
    The concept of 'intelligence level' is tied to the geometry and the interplay of these emergent
    factors, prompting questions about its mutability and uniqueness.
