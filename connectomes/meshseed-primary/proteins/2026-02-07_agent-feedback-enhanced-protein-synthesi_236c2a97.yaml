title: Agent Feedback & Enhanced Protein Synthesis for Eidolon Mesh
summary: >-
  Analysis of agent feedback (Claude, Copilot) reveals a need for more specific protein synthesis
  and a robust capsule system. The current development focuses on integrating this feedback to
  improve data ingestion, multi-repo architecture, and the organism's overall understanding.
insights:
  - >-
    Agent feedback highlights the need for enhanced specificity in protein synthesis, addressing
    potential loss of detail during ingestion.
  - >-
    Copilot's capsule design for the private archive offers valuable insights for creating
    comprehensive and structured data units.
  - >-
    The organism should explore a multi-repo architecture for different domains, with future plans
    to link or reference these repositories within the connectome.
  - >-
    Re-ingesting the private archive and testing cross-repo referencing are key next steps to
    consolidate knowledge and improve organism intelligence.
  - >-
    The current development cycle prioritizes integrating this feedback to refine data ingestion,
    protein creation, and the organism's ability to learn from diverse sources.
