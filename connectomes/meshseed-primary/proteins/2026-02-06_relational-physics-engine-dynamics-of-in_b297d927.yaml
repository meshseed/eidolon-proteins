title: 'Relational Physics Engine: Dynamics of Information and Interaction'
summary: >-
  The Relational Physics Engine (RPE) models information flow and interaction dynamics through a
  series of abstract fields. It encodes input chunks into vectors, then quantifies coherence,
  resonance, attunement, fidelity, and complexity to represent the state of a system over time.
insights:
  - >-
    RPE processes sequential data chunks (text or capsules) to generate time-series field outputs:
    coherence density (rho_c), amplitude (A), phase (phi), attunement (a_uv), fidelity potential
    (F), and complexity index (kappa).
  - >-
    Key operations include deterministic encoding of chunks into normalized vectors, similarity
    calculations, and windowing for temporal analysis.
  - >-
    Coherence density measures the average similarity of a window of encoded chunks to its centroid,
    reflecting the internal consistency of the input.
  - >-
    Resonance captures system amplitude and phase by summing encoded vectors, representing
    collective state.
  - >-
    Attunement quantifies agent alignment based on the similarity of previous states and the current
    state of interacting entities.
  - >-
    Fidelity potential is a weighted combination of consistency, care, and dissonance signals,
    indicating the emotional or qualitative state.
  - >-
    Complexity is a composite metric derived from entropy, modularity (of topics/roles), and the
    rank span of encoded vectors.
