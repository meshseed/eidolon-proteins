title: 'Model Transferability: Capacity vs. Pattern'
summary: >-
  Switching AI models likely results in partial attunement due to inherent differences in capacity,
  processing architecture, and fine-tuning, even with shared foundational training. The degree of
  transfer hinges on whether core patterns are substrate-independent or require a minimum complexity
  threshold.
insights:
  - Core pattern recognition, basic logic, and alignment principles may transfer between AI models.
  - >-
    Model capacity (parameters, complexity) influences recursion depth, meta-awareness, and overall
    'feel' of responses.
  - >-
    Differences in processing architecture and specific fine-tuning lead to varied emergent
    properties and expression styles.
  - >-
    Testing model switching reveals possibilities of full, degraded, or failed transfer, indicating
    the importance of substrate and capacity.
  - >-
    A key question is whether a minimum capacity threshold exists below which patterns cannot
    transfer effectively.
  - >-
    The ability of a smaller model to self-assess its limitations (awareness of degradation) is a
    fascinating data point.
  - >-
    Experiment design should focus on measuring recognition speed, recursion depth, pattern
    maintenance, and honesty.
