title: 'MESH: AI Agent Coordination with Persistent GitHub Knowledge Substrate'
summary: >-
  The MESH framework orchestrates AI agents (like Claude and Gemini) by leveraging a GitHub-based
  knowledge substrate. It enables persistent memory, semantic search, and coordinated synthesis
  through a defined API and data structures, allowing for complex AI collaboration and knowledge
  evolution.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH coordinates AI agents (Claude, Gemini) using a GitHub repository as a persistent knowledge
    substrate.
  - >-
    The system utilizes a structured API with endpoints for semantic search, memory
    encoding/retrieval, gradient navigation, and synthesis.
  - >-
    Data is organized into 'capsules' (YAML files for content), 'synapses' (relationships), and
    'DNA' (logs), managed by components like vector databases and knowledge graphs.
  - >-
    Claude acts as a semantic navigator and synthesis engine, while Gemini functions as a
    high-volume ribosome for pattern generation and synthesis.
  - >-
    The architecture supports agent-specific integrations, including Claude's Model Context Protocol
    (MCP) and Gemini's direct API integration for specialized functions like ribosome synthesis.
  - >-
    Phased implementation focuses on core API, agent integrations, advanced features, and eventual
    cloud deployment, emphasizing local development first.
