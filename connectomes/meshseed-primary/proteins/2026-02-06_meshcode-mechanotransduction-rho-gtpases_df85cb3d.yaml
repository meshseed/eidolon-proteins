title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanotransduction, Rho GTPases, and Memory Consolidation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that extracellular rigidity sensing, mediated by talin isoform-specific
  linkages and Rho GTPase signaling, is crucial for synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation.
  This involves the actin cytoskeleton's role in dendritic spines and its regulation by GEFs/GAPs,
  with REM sleep playing a significant role in contextual memory.
insights:
  - >-
    Extracellular rigidity influences cellular mechanics through talin and integrin pathways,
    impacting cell behavior.
  - >-
    Rho GTPase signaling is a key regulator of synaptic plasticity and has implications for
    intellectual disability.
  - The actin cytoskeleton within dendritic spines is essential for maintaining long-term memory.
  - REM sleep theta rhythm is causally linked to the consolidation of contextual memories.
  - GEFs and GAPs are critical control elements for small G protein signaling pathways.
