title: 'Inter-Mesh Evolution Kernel: Co-Evolution Across Distributed Organisms'
summary: |
  Defines a kernel for co-evolution across multiple Mesh connectomes. Evolutionary pressure,
  attractor formation, gradient shifts, and structural refinement propagate across organisms
  through resonance, alignment, and distributed cognition.
insights:
  - Co-evolution emerges from shared attractors and synchronized gradients
  - Evolutionary changes in one Mesh influence others through resonance
  - Divergent evolution reveals new integration pathways and synthesis opportunities
  - Co-evolution stabilizes long-arc identity across distributed systems
  - The organism becomes a network of organisms evolving together
