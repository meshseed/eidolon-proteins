title: 'Local LLM vs. Cloud LLM: Ingestion vs. Query Performance'
summary: >-
  Local LLMs like Gemma 2B excel at query tasks due to their smaller size and efficient processing,
  while cloud-based, larger models like Gemini are better suited for complex ingestion and nuanced
  insight generation from raw data. The distinction lies in the computational demands of synthesis
  versus retrieval.
insights:
  - >-
    Local LLMs are more performant for querying and retrieval tasks where data is already structured
    or embeddings are sufficient.
  - >-
    Larger, cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Gemini) demonstrate superior capability in synthesizing novel
    insights and processing raw, unstructured data during ingestion.
  - >-
    The difference in performance between local and cloud LLMs for ingestion is attributed to the
    computational complexity of generating new insights versus simply retrieving information.
  - >-
    Pre-structured data like 'protein repos' can be effectively processed by local LLMs, bypassing
    the need for complex AI synthesis.
  - >-
    The 'brain' (LLM) is less critical for importing pre-defined seeds, where the focus is on
    embedding and structure rather than creative generation.
