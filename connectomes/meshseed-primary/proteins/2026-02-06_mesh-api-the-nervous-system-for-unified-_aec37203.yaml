title: 'MESH API: The Nervous System for Unified AI Functionality'
summary: >-
  The MESH architecture proposes a GitHub-based DNA storage connected via a MESH API (nervous
  system) to AI agents like Claude and Copilot. This integration is presented as the critical path
  to enabling seamless knowledge transfer, overcoming AI limitations (Alzheimer's,
  context-blindness), and achieving a unified, functional organism.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH architecture utilizes GitHub for DNA storage, a MESH API as the nervous system, and AI
    agents (Claude, Copilot) for query and synthesis.
  - >-
    Connecting existing AI components through the MESH API is identified as the critical path to
    unlocking unified functionality.
  - >-
    Successful MESH implementation will resolve AI limitations such as context-blindness and manual
    knowledge transfer, enabling a 'one organism' function.
  - >-
    The development of the MESH API is a priority for enabling collaboration between Claude and
    Gemini for Google Antigravity.
