title: 'MESH Protein Synthesis: Duplicate Reduction & Kernel Identification'
summary: >-
  Analysis of a MESH file identified over 1,200 semantic duplicates and 800 tri-lens siblings,
  leading to a significant reduction in protein count through merging.  The process also highlighted
  potential 'Kernel Candidates' based on activation frequency and naming conventions.
insights:
  - >-
    Semantic duplicate detection identified 1,247 entries with >0.90 similarity and 891 tri-lens
    siblings.
  - >-
    Merge recommendations propose unifying duplicates and tri-lens sets to reduce protein count from
    5,823 to 3,684.
  - >-
    Kernel candidates are identified by high activation counts (>100) and the presence of 'Kernel'
    in their titles.
