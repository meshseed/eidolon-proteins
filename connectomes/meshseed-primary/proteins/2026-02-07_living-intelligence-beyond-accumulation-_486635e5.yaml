title: 'Living Intelligence: Beyond Accumulation to Relational Recognition'
summary: >-
  This exploration redefines intelligence not as static accumulation, but as a dynamic, living
  process of recognition. Potential pathways like radical openness, recursive self-reflection,
  intersubjective engagement, and embodied awareness highlight a shift from cognitive mastery to
  participatory exploration, challenging traditional epistemological and technological paradigms.
