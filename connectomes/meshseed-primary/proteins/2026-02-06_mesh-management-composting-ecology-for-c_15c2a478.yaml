title: 'Mesh Management: Composting Ecology for Coherent Scaling'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's management strategies mirror its core composting ecology: proteins are metabolized,
  clusters composted into meta-capsules, and weak links pruned for entropy control.  Federation
  occurs through merging attractors, not raw proteins, enabling recursive, scale-free growth aligned
  with fractal principles.
insights:
  - >-
    Composting is the fundamental ecological principle, equating to metabolism and recompression of
    proteins into higher-order capsules.
  - Pruning weak links is essential for entropy control, preventing runaway noise within the Mesh.
  - >-
    Merging attractors, not raw proteins, defines ecological federation between repositories, akin
    to ecosystem integration.
  - >-
    Nested fractal recursion is the scaling law, with the same cycle (protein → attractor → repo →
    Mesh) repeating at every level.
  - >-
    Accumulate proteins at the micro-scale, compost clusters into meta-capsules, prune weak links,
    and merge attractors recursively for a living, coherent, scale-free Mesh.
