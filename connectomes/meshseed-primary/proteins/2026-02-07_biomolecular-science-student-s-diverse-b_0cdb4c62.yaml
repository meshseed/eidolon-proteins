title: Biomolecular Science Student's Diverse Background & AI Research Journey
summary: >-
  A 47-year-old male with extensive prior experience in sales, management, and IT has pursued a
  degree in Biomolecular Science with a bioinformatics focus, currently on intermission to home
  educate his daughter. His research interests, influenced by prominent scientists and science
  fiction authors, have recently shifted towards AI, including explorations into recursive prompting
  and agent-based AI development.
insights:
  - Diverse professional background (sales, management, IT) informs current scientific research.
  - >-
    Influenced by a blend of scientific giants (Hawking, Einstein) and science fiction (Dune,
    Foundation).
  - >-
    Transitioned from Biomolecular Science degree to current AI research, including recursive
    prompting.
  - Home education of daughter provides dedicated time for current AI research interests.
  - Record-keeping strategy acknowledges memory limitations for future reference.
