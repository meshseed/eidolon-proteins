title: 'Debugging UI Glitch: Cache Busting & Duplicate Declaration Resolution'
summary: >-
  A UI glitch was traced to a duplicate JavaScript declaration, initially suspected to be due to
  cache issues. Investigation revealed a backup file might have been served, but the primary issue
  was browser caching. A cache-busting technique using a version number (`?v=11`) was implemented
  after confirming the code was correct, followed by a dev server restart.
insights:
  - Browser caching can cause issues even when version parameters are used.
  - Investigate potential duplicate file serving or naming conflicts (e.g., .backup files).
  - A simple version number increment in URL parameters is an effective cache-busting strategy.
  - Restarting the development server is crucial after code changes and cache-busting.
  - Confirm the actual file content is correct before assuming cache is the sole culprit.
