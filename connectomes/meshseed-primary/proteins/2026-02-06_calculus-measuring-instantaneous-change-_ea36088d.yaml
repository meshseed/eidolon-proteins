title: 'Calculus: Measuring Instantaneous Change and Accumulation'
summary: >-
  Calculus provides the mathematical framework to understand instantaneous rates of change
  (derivatives) and accumulated quantities (integrals). These foundational concepts are inverse
  operations, enabling the analysis of dynamic phenomena and optimization across various fields.
insights:
  - Derivatives capture instantaneous rates of change as a limit process.
  - Integrals represent the accumulation of quantities, often visualized as the area under a curve.
  - >-
    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus establishes the inverse relationship between differentiation
    and integration.
  - Key rules like the power, chain, and product rules facilitate derivative calculations.
  - >-
    Calculus is essential for modeling and solving problems in physics, optimization, and machine
    learning.
