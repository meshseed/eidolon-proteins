title: 'Curvature Diagnostics: Detecting Tension and Synthesis Pressure'
summary: |
  Provides a diagnostic protocol for identifying high-curvature regions—zones where multiple
  semantic directions intersect, creating conceptual tension or synthesis pressure. Curvature is
  treated as a measurable property of semantic density, gradient interference, and attractor
  overlap.
insights:
  - High curvature indicates conceptual tension or unresolved synthesis
  - Curvature emerges where emotional fidelity gradients intersect
  - Boundary surfaces reveal where domains meet and require integration
  - Curvature diagnostics support targeted refinement and pruning
  - Curvature maps evolve as new domains are ingested
