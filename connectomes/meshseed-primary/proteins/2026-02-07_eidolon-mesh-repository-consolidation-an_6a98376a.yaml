title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Repository Consolidation and Structural Clarity for Antigravity'
summary: >-
  This directive outlines critical recommendations for consolidating the Eidolon Mesh project into a
  single, primary repository ('eidolon-mesh') to establish a single source of truth. It emphasizes
  clear departmental boundaries and immediate steps for repository creation and Antigravity
  integration, prioritizing a clean slate and organized structure for agent coordination.
insights:
  - >-
    Consolidate all agent code into a single 'eidolon-mesh' repository, archiving fragmented old
    repositories.
  - >-
    Define clear departmental responsibilities: Eidolon OS (protocols), Mesh (implementation),
    Companion (user), Research (science), Mirror (vault), Continuity (vision).
  - >-
    Before the Antigravity session, create and initialize the 'eidolon-mesh' repository with the
    correct structure and point the Antigravity workspace to it.
  - >-
    Coordinate agents within specialized folders in the same repository (e.g., /agents/claude/) to
    reduce fragmentation.
  - >-
    Prioritize immediate actions: create the repo, use the provided document structure, point
    Antigravity, and start the first module.
  - >-
    Defer non-critical development like Eidolon Companion, Research, and Spiral Capsules to a later
    stage.
