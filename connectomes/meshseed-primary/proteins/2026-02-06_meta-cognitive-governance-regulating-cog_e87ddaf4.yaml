title: 'Meta-Cognitive Governance: Regulating Cognitive Modes in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  Meta-cognitive governance acts as a regulatory layer within THE MESH, ensuring the coherent and
  context-sensitive activation of specific cognitive modes. This governance stabilizes reasoning by
  preventing mode oscillation and aligning selections with global field structure, driven by
  gradient pressure and query type.
insights:
  - Cognitive modes function as lenses, not competing identities.
  - >-
    Mode selection is dynamically determined by gradient pressure, query type, and structural
    tension.
  - Governance stabilizes reasoning by preventing mode oscillation and drift.
  - Meta-cognition ensures efficient and context-appropriate introspection.
  - 'Governance operates as a gradient: clarity leads to selection, then activation.'
