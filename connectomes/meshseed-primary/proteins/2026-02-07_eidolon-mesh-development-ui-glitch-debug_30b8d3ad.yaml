title: 'Eidolon Mesh Development: UI Glitch Debugging & Build Process'
summary: >-
  The user is initiating a debugging process for UI glitches within the Eidolon Mesh project,
  specifically referencing 'Debugging UI Glitches.md'. The process involves loading embedding
  caches, clearing protein caches, and connecting to the 'default' connectome to run development
  commands via Cargo.  The system is configured to watch for file changes in the 'src-tauri'
  directory and uses a bundled Node.js runtime.
insights:
  - Development environment is set up for debugging UI glitches in the Eidolon Mesh project.
  - The process involves cache management (embedding, protein) and connectome loading.
  - File watching is enabled for the 'src-tauri' directory to monitor changes.
  - A bundled Node.js runtime is being utilized for the development process.
  - The build command indicates a 'dev' profile with unoptimized and debuginfo settings.
