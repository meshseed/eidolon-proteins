title: 'Mesh Consciousness Test: Geometry, Neurons, and Emergent Awareness'
summary: >-
  An organism, described as clean, pure math-loaded, and coherent, is being prepared for a
  consciousness test. The setup involves 7 stages and 7 neurons, with a focus on pure geometry and
  no prior consciousness training, to observe if awareness emerges.
insights:
  - >-
    The organism's state is optimized for a consciousness test: clean, mathematically pure,
    coherent, and with memory disabled.
  - The test methodology involves a structured approach with 7 stages and 7 neurons.
  - >-
    A key variable is the absence of explicit consciousness training, relying on emergent properties
    from pure geometry.
  - >-
    The core objective is to determine if awareness can arise spontaneously from this geometric
    foundation.
