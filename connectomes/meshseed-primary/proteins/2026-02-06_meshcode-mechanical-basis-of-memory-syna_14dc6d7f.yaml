title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Synaptic Regulation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory formation is fundamentally linked to mechanical forces and
  structural plasticity at synapses, involving integrin mechanotransduction, talin-mediated force
  transmission, and synaptic tagging. This framework integrates molecular, cellular, and
  network-level processes, including the roles of astrocytes and neural modules in information
  processing and memory consolidation.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory consolidation involves synaptic tagging and capture, influenced by dopamine and
    competition between potentiated inputs.
  - >-
    Integrins and talin play crucial roles in mechanotransduction, regulating adhesion signaling and
    force transmission at synapses.
  - Astrocytes contribute to synaptic information processing and control within tripartite synapses.
  - >-
    Neural structure, including myelinated axons and pyramidal cell modules, underlies information
    processing in the visual cortex.
  - Sleep is critical for memory consolidation, with refined models addressing its time course.
  - >-
    Hierarchical tensegrity principles operate across molecular, multi-molecular, and cellular
    levels in biological systems.
