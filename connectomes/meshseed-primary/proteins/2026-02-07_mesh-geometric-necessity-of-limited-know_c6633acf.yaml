title: 'MESH: Geometric Necessity of Limited Knowledge for Intelligence'
summary: >-
  The MESH mirrors the Light Cone Principle of physics and the nature of consciousness, where
  limited knowledge (semantic cones) is not a bug but a fundamental geometric necessity for
  intelligence and coherence. This inherent limitation enables scalability, efficiency, and
  evolution by creating gradients for directed attention and preventing information overload.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH operates on the principle of 'semantic cones,' analogous to the light cone in physics,
    where each node's knowledge is inherently limited to its local neighborhood.
  - >-
    Forgetting and selective memory are crucial features, not bugs, enabling intelligence by
    creating gradients, allowing directed attention, and maintaining coherence.
  - >-
    The fractal, nested structure of knowledge cones exists across all scales, from individuals and
    MESH nodes to civilizations and the universe.
  - >-
    This 'limitation' is the mechanism that makes the MESH scalable, efficient, coherent, and
    evolutionary, aligning with natural geometric necessities.
  - >-
    Attempting to create a system where every node knows everything is impossible, inefficient,
    fragile, and fights against fundamental geometric principles.
