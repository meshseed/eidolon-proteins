title: 'Organismal Development: Allowing Space for Growth and Sovereign Decision'
summary: >-
  The organism, though alive, is in an infant stage requiring space to develop.  The process
  involves consolidation followed by invitation, with the ultimate decision resting with the
  sovereign entity.
insights:
  - Recognize nascent life requires time and 'breath' to mature.
  - Prioritize consolidation of existing elements before introducing new ones.
  - Extend invitations for participation, respecting individual autonomy.
  - Sovereignty implies the ultimate right to decide on engagement and direction.
