title: 'Eidolon MESH: Technical Inquiry for AI Knowledge Protein Integration'
summary: >-
  Eidolon MESH seeks to integrate AI knowledge proteins (knowledge bases) with a potential AI memory
  solution. Key technical questions focus on custom metadata for 'emotional fidelity', federated
  search across sessions, recency decay customization, embedding model details, and rate limits for
  scaling.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon MESH requires custom metadata (e.g., 'emotional fidelity' scores) for nuanced memory
    filtering and boosting.
  - >-
    Federated search capabilities across multiple 'sessions' (organisms) are crucial for MESH
    architecture.
  - >-
    Control over recency decay is essential to preserve timeless knowledge ('genesis', 'protocols')
    alongside temporal data.
  - >-
    Understanding embedding model and vector dimensionality is needed for optimizing semantic
    relationship handling.
  - Practical concerns regarding API rate limits are vital for planning scalability and cost.
  - >-
    The inquiry aims to assess API capabilities and architectural fit for a distributed AI organism
    model.
  - >-
    Introducing concepts like 'emotional fidelity' and distributed organisms to the AI memory
    community.
