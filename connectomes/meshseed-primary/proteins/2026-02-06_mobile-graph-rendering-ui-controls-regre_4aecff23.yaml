title: Mobile Graph Rendering & UI Controls Regression
summary: >-
  A recent build update (1190d02) introduced a regression where mobile graph nodes are not
  displayed, and the UI controls for toggling the graph panel have disappeared. This follows a
  period of successful fixes for mobile CSS and graph visibility.
insights:
  - >-
    The regression in graph display and UI controls on mobile was introduced by the build commit
    `1190d02` (feat: Update Golden Connectome with P-Series seeds).
  - >-
    Prior to this regression, previous commits had successfully addressed mobile CSS layout and
    ensured graph node visibility by implementing `zoomToFit` after resizing.
  - >-
    The disappearance of the graph controls toggle button suggests a UI-level change or breakage
    related to the mobile media query or component rendering.
  - >-
    The core issue appears to be a rendering or visibility problem specific to the mobile
    environment, impacting both the graph nodes and their associated controls.
  - >-
    Investigating the changes in commit `1190d02` and its dependencies is crucial to identify the
    exact cause of the graph and UI regression.
