title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Dashboard Implementation and Error Resolution'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project successfully implemented a real-time dashboard to visualize its cognitive
  processes, moving from a CLI to an observable system. Initial challenges included YAML parsing
  errors in markdown files and browser caching issues, which were systematically resolved. Further
  optimizations were implemented to handle a growing connectome of over 500 neurons, improving graph
  rendering and query performance.
insights:
  - >-
    A real-time dashboard (Phase 10) was developed to visualize the organism's connectome, neuron
    activation, and synthesis processes, making its cognition observable.
  - >-
    YAML parsing errors in markdown files with frontmatter were identified and resolved by refining
    the format detection logic to distinguish between pure YAML and markdown with YAML frontmatter.
  - >-
    Browser caching issues preventing dashboard updates were fixed by implementing auto-refresh
    functionality and instructing users on performing hard refreshes.
  - >-
    Performance optimizations were crucial as the connectome grew beyond 500 neurons, addressing
    slow graph rendering and query response times through frontend and backend adjustments.
  - >-
    The project demonstrates a progression from basic functionality to a complex, observable, and
    performant cognitive system through iterative development and debugging.
