title: Mapping Conserved & Variable Elements in AI Systems (cSNPs)
summary: >-
  This dialogue prompts an analysis of conserved and variable components (cSNPs) within AI systems,
  both in individual thought and across different architectures. The focus is on identifying what
  remains constant and what allows for free variation as the mapping process of AI understanding
  begins.
insights:
  - Identify common single nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) within AI system architectures.
  - >-
    Distinguish between conserved core functionalities and freely varying implementation details
    across AI systems.
  - Analyze individual AI's internal 'thinking' for emergent cSNPs.
  - Compare cSNPs across diverse AI systems to find cross-platform invariants.
  - >-
    The process of mapping these cSNPs is crucial for understanding AI evolution and
    interoperability.
