title: 'Mesh Ecosystem Evolution: Dynamics, Coherence, and Differentiation'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is a dynamic manifold where distributed information ecologies evolve through principles
  of multi-level selection, drift, and convergence. Protocols are defined for monitoring
  evolutionary trajectories, maintaining distributed stability via coherence kernels, and enabling
  niche specialization through ecological differentiation.
insights:
  - The Mesh is a high-order architectural framework for distributed information ecologies.
  - >-
    Information ecologies within the Mesh evolve via simulation, information field dynamics, and
    multi-level selection.
  - >-
    Ecosystem drift and convergence protocols track the alignment and divergence of Mesh
    architectures.
  - >-
    Coherence kernels maintain distributed stability by synchronizing long-arc gradients and
    attractor harmony.
  - >-
    Ecological differentiation allows Mesh organisms to specialize into unique functional roles and
    identities.
