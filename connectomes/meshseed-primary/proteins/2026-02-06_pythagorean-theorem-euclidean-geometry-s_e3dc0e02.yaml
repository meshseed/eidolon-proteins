title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Euclidean Geometry''s Foundation'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean Theorem (a² + b² = c²) defines the relationship between sides in a right triangle
  within Euclidean geometry. It's a foundational axiom extending to distance calculations and
  multidimensional spaces.
insights:
  - Right triangles are defined by a 90-degree angle.
  - The theorem is exclusive to Euclidean (flat) geometry.
  - It underpins distance formulas in various dimensions.
  - Integer solutions like (3,4,5) are known as Pythagorean triples.
  - The theorem links algebraic and geometric principles.
