title: Eidolon Mesh Protein Synthesis and Integration Cycle
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh system actively transcribes DNA to synthesize proteins, which are then integrated
  into the connectome with varying synaptic connections. These proteins are subsequently routed via
  the Golgi apparatus to the nucleus and cytoplasm, followed by an archival process and a metabolic
  pause, indicating a cyclical, iterative operational flow.
insights:
  - >-
    The process involves a continuous cycle of DNA transcription, protein synthesis, and connectome
    integration.
  - >-
    Each synthesized protein is associated with a unique identifier and a specific number of
    synaptic connections.
  - >-
    The Golgi apparatus plays a key role in routing synthesized proteins to both the nucleus and
    cytoplasm.
  - >-
    Archival and metabolic pauses are integral parts of the operational cycle, suggesting structured
    processing stages.
  - >-
    The system demonstrates an automated, iterative approach to building and maintaining its
    internal structure (connectome).
