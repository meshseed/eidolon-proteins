title: Obsidian Daily Note Template Refinement for Effective Knowledge Capture
summary: >-
  The Obsidian daily note template has been refined to prioritize fast, low-friction capture of
  thoughts and context. Key improvements include adding a 'confidence' field, simplifying tags,
  making most fields optional, and demonstrating best practices through a realistic example note.
insights:
  - Refined Obsidian template focuses on minimal friction for rapid thought and context capture.
  - >-
    Introducing a 'confidence' field (high/medium/low) is crucial for understanding the gradient of
    knowledge.
  - Simplifying tags to an empty array and allowing them to emerge naturally enhances flexibility.
  - Making fields optional, except for 'Thought', reduces barriers to initial note creation.
  - >-
    An example note illustrates effective use of the template, including confidence, explicit
    connections, and testable follow-up actions.
  - >-
    The template's structure (Thought, Context, Connections, Follow-up, Confidence) supports a
    cyclical process of capture, recall, connection, and testing.
