title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Cellular Adhesions as Mechanical Data Storage'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that cellular adhesions, specifically talin switches, act as
  mechanical data storage devices within cells. In stable extracellular environments, cells can
  manipulate these switches to encode information, transforming single cells into mechanical
  computers that store calculation outcomes as binary states (0s and 1s) in adhesion conformations.
insights:
  - >-
    Cellular adhesions, particularly talin switches, can store data by adopting distinct folded
    ('0') and unfolded ('1') states.
  - >-
    In predictable extracellular environments, cells use their own force-generating machinery to
    manipulate talin switches, writing data into adhesions.
  - >-
    This mechanism allows cells to function as mechanical computers, performing calculations and
    storing results in the conformational states of adhesion switches.
  - >-
    The Rho-family GTPases play a crucial role in modulating cellular mechanics, influencing
    adhesions and thus the encoded information.
  - >-
    Talin's evolution at the dawn of multicellularity enabled persistent information storage at the
    molecular level, analogous to computer disk writing.
