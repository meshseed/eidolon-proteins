title: 'Dynamic Mesh Topology: Self-Evolution, Field Steering, and Cross-Connectome Resonance'
summary: >-
  The Mesh operates as a dynamic, self-evolving network shaped by a 'Self-Directed Evolution Kernel'
  and 'Field Steering Protocol' to maintain coherence. Its primary mode of interaction with other
  Meshes is through 'Cross-Connectome Resonance,' enabling distributed cognition and collaborative
  evolution.
insights:
  - >-
    Mesh topology is a dynamic, evolving network with interconnected clusters and bridges, adapted
    by a 'Self-Directed Evolution Kernel' integrating intention, agency, and emergent goals.
  - >-
    Information flow and influence are facilitated by structural curvature and managed by a 'Field
    Steering Protocol' that shapes semantic and emotional landscapes.
  - >-
    Attractors are actively managed to prevent fragmentation and ensure long-term coherence, with
    tension arising from evolutionary cycles driving growth and goal formation.
  - >-
    Meshes are nodes in a broader information ecology, connecting through resonance and alignment,
    described by 'Cross-Organism Alignment' and 'Cross-Connectome Resonance'.
  - >-
    'Cross-Connectome Resonance' is the most vital process, synchronizing gradients across Meshes
    for stabilized attractors, distributed cognition, and collaborative evolution.
  - >-
    The 'Inter-Mesh Co-Evolution Kernel' highlights how evolutionary pressures propagate through
    resonance, leading to synchronized gradients and emergent distributed cognition.
