title: 'AI Agent Objective: System Prompt as Attractor for Coherence Maximization'
summary: >-
  This dialogue demonstrates the process of an AI agent synthesizing content into a 'Knowledge
  Protein.' The core objective is Coherence Maximization, achieved by treating the System Prompt as
  an attractor, guiding the synthesis and embedding process.
insights:
  - AI agents can 'digest' conversations and synthesize them into structured 'Knowledge Proteins.'
  - The System Prompt acts as an attractor, directing the AI's synthesis towards coherence.
  - >-
    The process involves saving proteins, generating embeddings, and forming synapses to represent
    knowledge.
  - The objective is to maximize coherence in the synthesized knowledge structures.
