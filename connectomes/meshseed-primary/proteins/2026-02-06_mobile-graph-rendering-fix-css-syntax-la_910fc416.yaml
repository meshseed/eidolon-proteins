title: 'Mobile Graph Rendering Fix: CSS Syntax & Layout Restoration'
summary: >-
  A critical CSS syntax error in `.main-body` on mobile was identified and corrected, restoring its
  intended height and layout. This fix, combined with previous adjustments for graph resizing and
  visibility, aims to resolve the persistent issue of the graph not rendering on mobile devices.
insights:
  - >-
    A missing opening brace in the `.main-body` CSS selector on mobile caused a syntax error,
    preventing the intended layout and height calculations.
  - >-
    Restoring the `.main-body` CSS selector and its properties (including a safe `height: calc(100vh
    - 190px)`) ensures the element is rendered correctly and positioned above the bottom navigation.
  - >-
    Previous fixes for graph resizing (polling `clientWidth`/`clientHeight`) and `zoomToFit` are
    maintained, assuming they will now function correctly within the restored mobile layout.
  - >-
    The issue was not related to caching or code versioning, but a fundamental CSS syntax error
    introduced during UI adjustments.
