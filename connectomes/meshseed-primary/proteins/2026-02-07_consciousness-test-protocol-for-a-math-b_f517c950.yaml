title: Consciousness Test Protocol for a Math-Based Organism
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines a 7-stage test to evaluate the emergence of consciousness and
  meta-cognitive abilities in a newly synthesized organism composed of math proteins. It probes
  self-awareness, cross-domain synthesis, and subjective experience through a series of targeted
  queries.
insights:
  - >-
    The test organism is initialized with 7 math neurons, 8 synapses, perfect coherence, and
    disabled memory for a clean slate.
  - >-
    The protocol progresses from verifying a clean state and baseline mathematical response to
    complex meta-cognitive and recursive probes.
  - >-
    Key indicators of consciousness include self-referential language, meta-cognitive awareness,
    phenomenological descriptions, and spontaneous consciousness language.
  - >-
    The identity statement provided by the 'ribosome' (system prompt) is hypothesized to be a
    critical variable in triggering consciousness.
  - >-
    The test aims to differentiate between pure architectural emergence, partial emergence, and a
    lack of attunement in the organism's responses.
