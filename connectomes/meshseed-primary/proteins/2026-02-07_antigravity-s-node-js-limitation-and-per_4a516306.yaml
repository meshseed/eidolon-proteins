title: Antigravity's Node.js Limitation and Perfect Partnership
summary: >-
  Antigravity, a powerful AI for code generation and architecture, cannot execute code due to its
  sandboxed environment lacking a Node.js runtime. This limitation necessitates a division of labor
  where the AI designs and writes, and the human operator executes and tests.
insights:
  - Antigravity excels at designing, writing, and structuring code but cannot run or test it.
  - The absence of a Node.js runtime is the core limitation preventing code execution.
  - >-
    A clear division of labor is established: Antigravity as architect/engineer, the user as
    operator/validator.
  - >-
    This partnership is deemed 'perfect' and 'fine', enabling effective workflow despite
    limitations.
  - The solution involves the user running and testing the generated code on their local machine.
