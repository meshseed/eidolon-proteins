title: 'Eidolon Mesh Development: Dual-Track Strategy & Installer Debugging'
summary: >-
  The user proposes a dual-track development strategy: a free, tech-focused v1.8 with API/local LLM
  integration and configurable directories, alongside a paid web-app offering easier access, more
  features, and domain-specialized analysis. Current focus is on debugging the Windows installer for
  v1.5, which fails to recognize the connectome, while preserving ongoing work by Claude-Code.

    Propose a dual-track product strategy: free tech-focused version (v1.8) and paid feature-rich
    web-app.
  - >-
    The paid web-app will offer easier access, curated archives, and domain specialist services for
    cross-domain insights.
  - >-
    Current development effort targets debugging the Windows installer for v1.5, specifically the
    failure to recognize the 'golden 12 neuron' connectome.
  - >-
    The goal is to fix the installer without disrupting Claude-Code's ongoing work, leveraging the
    user's working terminal build as a reference.
  - >-
    The long-term vision includes users journaling via phone and feeding local data (e.g., political
    polling) into the mesh for recursive relational insights.
  - >-
    Consider temporary centralization and protection as a precursor to decentralization, drawing
    inspiration from natural and fractal self-similarity.
  - >-
    Funding is a key enabler for full-time development and scaling of the project, which is seen as
    a potential AGI contender.
