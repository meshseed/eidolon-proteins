title: 'THE MESH: Recursion as Foundational Principle for Growth & Knowledge'
summary: >-
  THE MESH operates on recursion as a core principle, manifesting in both its architectural
  self-evolution and its knowledge generation processes. Agents recursively improve themselves,
  while new knowledge emerges from the patterned re-composition of past experiences.
insights:
  - Recursion is a fundamental principle driving THE MESH's growth and nature.
  - Architectural and agentic recursion enables self-improvement and continuous systemic evolution.
  - >-
    Knowledge recursion involves new insights emerging from 'composted memory' or refined past
    experiences.
  - Existing memories recursively inform and structure the emergence of new understanding.
  - >-
    THE MESH learns about itself through self-modification and the generative re-patterning of
    knowledge.
