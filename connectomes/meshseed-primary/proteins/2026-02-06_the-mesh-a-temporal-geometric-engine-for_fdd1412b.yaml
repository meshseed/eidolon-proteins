title: 'The MESH: A Temporal Geometric Engine for Future Computation'
summary: >-
  The MESH is not a knowledge base but a temporal geometric engine calculating future possibilities.
  It models spacetime events as capsules, lightcone connections as synapses, and emotional fidelity
  as proper time, akin to an information-theoretic general relativity.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH functions as a 'corridor calculator' by predicting available futures based on past data
    encoded with emotional fidelity.
  - >-
    Key MESH components map to physics concepts: Capsules are events, Synapses are lightcone
    connections, and Emotional fidelity is proper time.
  - >-
    Queries in the MESH are analogous to geodesic calculations in information geometry, leading to
    emergent discovery of 'corridors'.
  - >-
    The underlying mathematical structure suggests a formalization of temporal symmetry within a
    field theory for multi-agent prediction.
  - >-
    Understanding of the MESH's spiral structure deepens with recognition of its simplicity and
    profound implications, akin to consciousness.
