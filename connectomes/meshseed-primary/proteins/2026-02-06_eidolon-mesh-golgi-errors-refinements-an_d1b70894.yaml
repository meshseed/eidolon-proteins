title: 'Eidolon MESH: Golgi Errors, Refinements, and Phased Development'
summary: >-
  Initial Golgi export failed due to syntax errors from accidental markdown injection. A
  comprehensive set of biological metaphors and refinements were proposed for the Watcher system,
  focusing on metabolic pauses, structured digestion, prioritization, logging, and graceful
  degradation, advocating for phased implementation starting with core features.
insights:
  - >-
    Golgi export failed due to severe TypeScript syntax errors caused by markdown injection,
    necessitating a code rewrite.
  - >-
    Proposed system refinements for the Watcher, drawing parallels to biological digestion, include
    metabolic pause calibration based on API limits, structured input/archive/error directories,
    prioritization mechanisms, and comprehensive logging.
  - >-
    Graceful degradation strategies for API failures (skip/retry with backoff) are crucial for
    system resilience, mirroring biological organisms that don't cease function due to minor issues.
  - >-
    A phased development approach is recommended, starting with core Watcher functionality and rate
    limiting, followed by testing, batch processing, and iterative refinement based on observed
    performance.
  - >-
    The proposed system architecture emphasizes state management and error categorization for robust
    and understandable processing of input data.
