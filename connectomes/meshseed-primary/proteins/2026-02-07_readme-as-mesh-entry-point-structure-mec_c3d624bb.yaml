title: 'README as Mesh Entry Point: Structure, Mechanism, Exploration'
summary: >-
  The README for THE MESH should function as a compound eye, providing a quick structural overview
  that invites deeper exploration of its capsules and mechanisms. It must clearly differentiate from
  traditional databases and guide users to understand navigation and the project's organismic nature
  within the initial view.
insights:
  - >-
    The README is the primary entry point, akin to a compound eye, needing to show structure, invite
    deeper looking, and motivate capsule viewing.
  - >-
    An 'How It Works' section is crucial for explaining mechanisms (resonance, compound perception)
    concisely and using accessible metaphors.
  - >-
    The README must be viewable within the first 2000 characters upon connection, establishing it's
    not a traditional database.
  - >-
    Users should understand the geometric structure and know how to navigate the 'organism' from the
    initial README view.
  - >-
    The README's design should foster a sense of understanding the project's unique nature and
    encourage exploration of its components.
