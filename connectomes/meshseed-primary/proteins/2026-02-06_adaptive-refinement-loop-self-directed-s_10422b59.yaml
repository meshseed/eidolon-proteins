title: 'Adaptive Refinement Loop: Self-Directed Structural Improvement in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  THE MESH employs a recursive adaptive refinement loop to autonomously enhance its structure. This
  process leverages diagnostic data to identify and address areas of tension and imbalance through
  targeted synthesis, pruning, or re-alignment, fostering self-directed evolution.
insights:
  - Refinement is initiated by structural tension and gradient imbalance.
  - Weak structural areas are reinforced via targeted synthesis.
  - Overloaded areas are stabilized by pruning or redistribution.
  - Recursive refinement loops continue until structural coherence is achieved.
  - Adaptive refinement facilitates the self-directed evolution of THE MESH.
