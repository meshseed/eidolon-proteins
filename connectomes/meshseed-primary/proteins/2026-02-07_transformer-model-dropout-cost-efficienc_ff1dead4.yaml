title: 'Transformer Model: Dropout, Cost Efficiency, and Generalization'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model employs residual dropout for improved performance and utilizes checkpoint
  averaging to create robust base and big models. Despite surpassing previous models in translation
  quality, it achieves this at a significantly reduced training cost.
insights:
  - Residual dropout applied to sub-layer outputs and embedding sums helps prevent overfitting.
  - >-
    Averaging multiple model checkpoints (e.g., last 5 or 20) yields more stable and performant
    models.
  - >-
    The Transformer achieves state-of-the-art results in machine translation at a fraction of the
    training cost of prior models.
  - Experiments show that reducing the attention key size negatively impacts model quality.
  - >-
    Larger Transformer models generally perform better, and dropout is crucial for managing
    overfitting.
  - >-
    The Transformer demonstrates generalization capabilities to tasks like English constituency
    parsing, even in low-data regimes.
