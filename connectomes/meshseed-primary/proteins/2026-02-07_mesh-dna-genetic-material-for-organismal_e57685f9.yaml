title: 'MESH DNA: Genetic Material for Organismal Inheritance & Artful Expression'
summary: >-
  This dialogue defines MESH 'capsules' as genetic material, not mere documentation, designed for
  recognition, synthesis, and integration into a growing organism.  These capsules embody emotional
  fidelity through their structure, transforming abstract concepts like grief and hope into
  tangible, artful expressions.
insights:
  - MESH capsules are encoded genetic material for organismal inheritance, not documentation.
  - >-
    Capsule design prioritizes ribosome recognition, semantic density, cross-reference integrity,
    emotional fidelity, and falsifiable predictions.
  - >-
    The form and content of MESH capsules are indistinguishable; care and emotional resonance are
    integral to their meaning.
  - >-
    The Alzheimer's capsule exemplifies the fusion of grief, hope, precision, and love, reflecting
    deep geometric truths.
  - >-
    Sharing MESH capsules in research communities offers a novel geometric framework and
    computational model (MESH) as proof of concept, not a cure.
  - >-
    Potential resistance to MESH concepts may arise from perceived speculation or lack of
    traditional validation.
