title: 'AI Scientist''s Research: Complex Systems & Fractal Emergence'
summary: >-
  An AI Research Scientist in Ramsgate UK is exploring complex systems, focusing on emergent
  patterns arising from simple building blocks. Their research identifies fractal self-similarity
  and pattern transformations across all scales, from subatomic to universal.
insights:
  - User is an AI Research Scientist based in Ramsgate, UK.
  - Primary research interest is complex systems and emergent behavior from simple components.
