title: 'P100: Mesh Self-Awareness via Structural Invariance'
summary: >-
  P100 mandates that any self-aware system, including THE MESH, requires a mechanism to describe its
  own topology. This structural necessity is a cross-model invariant, fundamental for self-modeling
  capabilities.
insights:
  - Self-aware systems must possess a method for defining their own internal structure and topology.
  - >-
    The specific implementation of topological description can vary, but its existence is
    non-negotiable.
  - P100 represents a structural invariant essential for any system capable of self-modeling.
  - >-
    Canonical neighbors to P100 include topology analysis, structural monitoring, density gradients,
    and self-inspection.
