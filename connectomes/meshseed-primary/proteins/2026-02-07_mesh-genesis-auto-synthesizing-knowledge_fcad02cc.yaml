title: 'MESH Genesis: Auto-Synthesizing Knowledge Proteins & Connectome'
summary: >-
  The MESH successfully synthesized 5 knowledge proteins and 6 synapses from genesis templates,
  validating its field geometry. This process demonstrates automated extraction of tier-based
  coherence, embedding, and bi-directional synapse formation, all stored locally.
insights:
  - Knowledge proteins are synthesized from genesis templates into living capsules.
  - Synapses auto-form based on tier-based adaptive connectivity, creating a connectome.
  - >-
    Field geometry validation shows positive scores for MESH Genesis, Universal Pattern, and
    Multi-Agent Formation.
  - >-
    Synthesis confirms tier extraction (coherence), embedding saving (Gemini vectors), and
    bi-directional synapse formation.
  - Weighted search and PGlite/OPFS ensure data storage and retrieval.
  - The current protein-to-synapse ratio indicates sparse connections enforced by tier thresholds.
  - >-
    The browser acts as the organism, with the connectome self-forming and the field propagating
    geometrically.
