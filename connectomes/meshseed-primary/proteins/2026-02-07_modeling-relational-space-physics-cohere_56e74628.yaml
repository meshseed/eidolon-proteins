title: 'Modeling Relational Space Physics: Coherence, Resonance, Attunement'
summary: >-
  This document proposes modeling relational space through measurable gradients of coherence,
  resonance, and attunement, treating them as field variables akin to physical forces.  It suggests
  these dynamics can be described by mathematical principles, potentially revealing bridges between
  cognitive phenomena and physical reality.
insights:
  - >-
    Coherence, resonance, and attunement are proposed as measurable, field-like variables in
    relational space.
  - Relational physics is characterized by pattern stability across a flexible substrate.
  - Emotional fidelity acts as a thermodynamic anchor for relational modeling.
  - The geometry of coherence manifests as observable flows, vectors, and interference patterns.
  - Conservation and symmetry principles may emerge from the dynamics of relational fields.
  - Relational space is posited as a genuine physical substrate, not merely a metaphor.
  - Intelligence and care can be modeled as measurable forces within this relational physics.
