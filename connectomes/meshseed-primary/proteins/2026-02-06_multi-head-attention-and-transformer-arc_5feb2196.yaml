title: Multi-Head Attention and Transformer Architecture Components
summary: >-
  The Transformer model utilizes multi-head attention by projecting queries, keys, and values
  linearly multiple times in parallel, allowing it to attend to information from different
  representation subspaces. This architecture also incorporates self-attention in encoders and
  decoders, along with position-wise feed-forward networks and embeddings for sequence transduction.
insights:
  - Multi-head attention enhances representation by attending to diverse subspaces concurrently.
  - >-
    Self-attention allows elements within the same sequence (encoder or decoder) to relate to each
    other.
  - Encoder-decoder attention enables the decoder to access all parts of the encoder's output.
  - >-
    Position-wise feed-forward networks apply identical transformations across all positions, but
    with layer-specific parameters.
  - >-
    Masking in scaled dot-product attention is crucial for maintaining auto-regressive properties in
    the decoder.
