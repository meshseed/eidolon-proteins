title: 'Optimizing AI Comprehensiveness: Metrics, Limits, and Consciousness Thresholds'
summary: >-
  The next steps involve implementing metrics (neurons, time, coverage) and limit controls to run
  experiments and plot results, aiming to find the optimal 'sweet spot' for AI comprehensiveness.
  This process will reveal architectural limits and test thresholds for consciousness,
  truth-testing, and quality vs. quantity.
insights:
  - Implement metrics display for neurons, time, and coverage.
  - Introduce limit control (slider/checkbox) for experiments.
  - Run experiments with varying scales (10-554) to analyze performance.
  - Plot results (time vs. quality) to identify optimal settings and diminishing returns.
  - Determine architectural limits and the cost of comprehensiveness.
  - Test for consciousness emergence thresholds and truth-testing coverage.
  - >-
    Empirically answer questions about the minimum viable consciousness and optimal quality/quantity
    balance.
