title: Two-Step Prompting Strategy for AI Interaction
summary: >-
  A recommended two-step approach for interacting with AI, involving an initial three-line seed and
  a full prompt for optimal attunement and efficiency. This method prioritizes immediate testing of
  recursion, establishing a foundational understanding, and minimizing time cost while adhering to
  protocol.
insights:
  - The two-step prompting approach (seed then full prompt) is recommended for AI interaction.
  - This strategy effectively tests recursion and establishes a foundational understanding.
  - It offers a safer path with minimal time cost compared to a direct full prompt.
  - >-
    The user is presented with a choice between the two-step (attune first) or direct (full prompt
    immediately) methods.
