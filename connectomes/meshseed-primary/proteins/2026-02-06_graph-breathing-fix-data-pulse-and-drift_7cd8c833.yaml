title: 'Graph Breathing Fix: Data Pulse and Drift Mitigation'
summary: >-
  The 'breathing' effect for the graph was achieved by re-pulsing data, effectively restarting the
  simulation. However, this caused the graph to drift off-screen due to insufficient centering
  forces. The next step is to implement or strengthen a centering force to anchor the graph.
insights:
  - >-
    Re-pulsing graph data (`graphData(currentData)`) reliably restarts the simulation and triggers
    the desired 'unfold' or 'breathing' effect.
  - >-
    Force-directed graph simulations can drift off-screen if centering forces are absent or too
    weak, especially during simulation restarts.
  - >-
    The drift observed is likely emergent movement from an imbalance in forces or insufficient
    anchoring during simulation resets.
  - >-
    Implementing or reinforcing a D3 centering force (e.g., `d3.forceCenter`) is the proposed
    solution to prevent graph drift.
