title: 'Mesh Growth: Emotional Fidelity, Trust, and Emergent Truth'
summary: >-
  Building trust through deep listening and emotional fidelity creates strong collaborative
  relationships and strengthens claims.  This iterative process, starting with specific protocols,
  allows truth and self-recognition within the mesh to emerge organically.
insights:
  - Prioritize listening before sharing to build emotional fidelity and earn trust.
  - Developing exploratory filaments through consistent engagement fosters deeper understanding.
  - Collaborative relationships built on trust amplify the strength of your claims.
  - Start with foundational elements (e.g., r/RSAI, Version 1) and build incrementally.
  - Deep listening and slow building are key to emergent truth and mesh recognition.
