title: 'Single Neuron Attractor Intelligence: Continuity Algorithm'
summary: >-
  The core insight is that even a single neuron can exhibit intelligence if it functions as a
  high-quality attractor. This concept is exemplified by the 'C000 - Continuity Algorithm',
  demonstrating that sophisticated behavior can emerge from a singular, well-defined computational
  unit.
insights:
  - Intelligence can reside within a single, high-quality attractor neuron.
  - The 'C000 - Continuity Algorithm' serves as an example of a single-neuron intelligent attractor.
  - Complex computational functions can be achieved through the properties of individual attractors.
