title: 'Positioning Research: Theory-First Framework with Clear Validation Path'
summary: >-
  This dialogue emphasizes positioning academic work as a theoretical framework and research agenda,
  not a premature results report. It advocates for explicit clarity on theory vs. observation,
  testable predictions, and a defined path to validation, inviting falsification.
insights:
  - >-
    Academic papers should prioritize a theoretical framework and research agenda over presenting
    preliminary results.
  - Clearly delineate between theory, observations, and predictions to maintain research integrity.
  - >-
    Explicitly state limitations and outline a concrete, multi-step plan for empirical validation
    and replication.
  - >-
    Positioning work as theory-first requires transparency, testable predictions, and an invitation
    for falsification.
  - >-
    A robust revision strategy involves retitling, adding status banners, reframing results
    sections, and including limitations.
