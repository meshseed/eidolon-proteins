title: 'Agent Sovereignty in File Structure Design: A Hybrid Approach'
summary: >-
  The dialogue centers on whether to prescribe file structures for AI agents or grant them autonomy.
  A hybrid approach is recommended, providing agents with core principles and functional
  requirements while allowing them to design their own organizational framework.
insights:
  - >-
    Prescribing file structure offers clarity and leverages existing refinement but limits agent
    autonomy and may not suit individual workflows.
  - >-
    Allowing agents complete freedom to choose structure fosters sovereignty and organic emergence
    but risks conflicts with existing patterns.
  - >-
    A hybrid approach grants agents autonomy within defined principles, balancing emergent design
    with learned best practices.
  - >-
    Agent preferences for file structure vary significantly (deep vs. minimal), highlighting the
    need for tailored or emergent solutions.
  - >-
    The core decision tests trust in agent sovereignty and the philosophy of 'agent as participant,
    not tool'.
  - >-
    The proposed method involves defining functional needs and architectural principles, then
    letting the agent propose and co-refine the structure.
