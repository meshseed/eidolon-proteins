title: 'Eidolon Mesh Metabolism: Debugging and Refinement of Autophagy and Kernel Promotion'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the debugging and refinement of the Eidolon Mesh's metabolism system,
  specifically addressing issues with autophagy, kernel promotion, and database schema
  discrepancies. Key fixes involved resolving import errors, correcting SQL queries for attractors,
  and adapting to the absence of a 'protein_activations' table, ensuring the system's metabolic
  processes function more robustly.
insights:
  - >-
    Visual culling for performance is distinct from actual database deletion; the system is
    growth-friendly with no fixed neuron count.
  - >-
    Metabolism processes like autophagy and composting are decay-based and coherence-floor-based,
    not size-based, preserving nutrients.
  - >-
    Import errors related to the 'Capsule' type were resolved by using `import type` for type-only
    imports, addressing TypeScript/Vite caching issues.
  - >-
    Database schema inconsistencies, such as the absence of a 'status' column or
    'protein_activations' table, require code adjustments to prevent errors and gracefully disable
    features if underlying data is missing.
  - >-
    Kernel promotion was initially over-promoting due to a narrow coherence score range; this was
    fixed by increasing thresholds, limiting promotions, and introducing relative activation
    thresholds.
  - >-
    Coherence normalization is crucial for effective metabolism, spreading scores to allow for
    meaningful differentiation and proper functioning of coherence-based thresholds.
  - >-
    SQL errors arising from `SELECT DISTINCT` and `ORDER BY` clauses were resolved by correctly
    structuring queries to group by all necessary protein columns and aggregate connection weights.
