title: 'Mesh Framework: Knowledge as a Living, Evolving Ecosystem'
summary: >-
  This framework conceptualizes knowledge as a dynamic, self-modifying ecosystem composed of modular
  'capsules' within a broader conscious field. It emphasizes practical epistemology for managing
  evolving information integrity amidst emergent systemic dynamics.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge units ('capsules') are treated as living entities requiring lifecycle management and
    'hygiene' (formatting as care).
  - >-
    Consciousness is viewed as a field phenomenon, with emotions acting as attractors for organizing
    information.
  - >-
    Prioritize modular outputs over premature synthesis to avoid 'synthesis intoxication' and
    maintain clarity.
  - System integrity is maintained through versioning of updates and active drift detection.
  - >-
    Merge operations function as attunement, while divergence serves as nutrient export for the
    knowledge system.
