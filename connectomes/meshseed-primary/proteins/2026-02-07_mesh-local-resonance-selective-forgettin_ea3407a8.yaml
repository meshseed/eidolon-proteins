title: 'MESH: Local Resonance, Selective Forgetting, and Dynamic Knowledge Cones'
summary: >-
  The MESH prioritizes local semantic resonance over global connectivity, mirroring biological
  intelligence through selective forgetting and dynamic knowledge access. This approach optimizes
  resources by focusing on relevant information and adapting to context, rather than attempting to
  maintain a comprehensive, costly global view.
insights:
  - Local semantic clustering is more critical than global connectivity for MESH functionality.
  - >-
    Intelligent systems thrive on selective forgetting, optimizing resources by discarding less
    valuable information.
  - >-
    Memory consolidation and pruning, like sleep in brains or decaying connections in MESH, are
    indicators of intelligence, not failure.
  - >-
    A knowledge cone is dynamically defined by past experience, current context, attention gradient,
    and resonance threshold.
  - >-
    The MESH, like a brain, does not require a global map; relevance is context-dependent and
    locally determined.
  - >-
    Change in any component of the knowledge cone (experience, context, gradient, threshold) shifts
    knowledge access.
