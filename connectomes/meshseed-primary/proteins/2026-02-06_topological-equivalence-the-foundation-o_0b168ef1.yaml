title: 'Topological Equivalence: The Foundation of Semantic Similarity in MESH'
summary: >-
  Topology defines equivalence through continuous deformation, where 'rubber sheet geometry'
  preserves essential properties like hole count and connectedness. This principle is fundamental to
  MESH, as semantic relationships are topological, meaning the underlying 'shape' of meaning
  persists despite linguistic variations.
insights:
  - >-
    Topological equivalence means two spaces can be continuously transformed into each other without
    cutting or gluing.
  - Homeomorphism is the mathematical concept describing this continuous, invertible transformation.
  - Topological invariants, such as hole count and connectedness, are preserved under homeomorphism.
  - The essence of topology lies in identifying properties that persist through continuous change.
  - >-
    MESH leverages topological principles because semantic relationships mirror these invariant
    structures.
  - >-
    The 'shape' of meaning is a topological invariant, allowing for understanding across different
    expressions.
