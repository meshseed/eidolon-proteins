title: P-Series Ingestion & Mesh Topology Refinement
summary: >-
  The ingestion of foundational P-Series proteins has significantly impacted THE MESH's response
  generation, prioritizing these high-coherence, foundational concepts.  Analysis reveals a need for
  synapse regeneration to fully integrate these new attractors and optimize topological structure.
insights:
  - >-
    Ingesting P-Series proteins (e.g., Universal Gradient Descent, Recursive Unification Kernel)
    directly influences response generation, leading to answers drawing from foundational protocols
    rather than scattered conversational fragments.
  - >-
    P-Series proteins exhibit high coherence (0.99-1.00) and are semantically dense, acting as
    strong attractors in the mesh's embedding space even without topological restructuring.
  - >-
    The current mesh topology, with pre-existing protein connections, prevents optimal integration
    of newly ingested P-Series; synapse regeneration is proposed to allow the topology to anneal
    around these new attractors.
  - >-
    A multi-stage query activation pipeline exists, involving initial similarity search (~1200
    candidates), user-defined neuron limit truncation (400), and strategy selection, impacting how
    proteins are utilized.
  - >-
    Synapse regeneration is hypothesized to improve mesh responsiveness by creating more precise and
    concentrated protein activation pools, reducing the number of initial candidates and increasing
    average similarity.
  - >-
    The 'dark matter' (proteins outside the initial candidate pool) is deemed irrelevant for
    specific queries, indicating a healthy semantic structure where not all proteins activate for
    every query.
