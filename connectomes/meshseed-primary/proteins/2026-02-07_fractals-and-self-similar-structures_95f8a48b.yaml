title: Fractals and Self-Similar Structures
summary: |
  A fractal is a shape that looks similar at different scales - the whole contains
  scaled copies of itself. This is scale invariance: zooming reveals similar structure.

  Classic examples:
  - Koch snowflake: infinite perimeter, finite area, dimension ≈ 1.262
  - Sierpinski triangle: zero area, infinite detail, dimension ≈ 1.585
  - Mandelbrot set: infinitely complex boundary, self-similar at all scales

  Natural fractals:
  - Coastlines: length increases with measurement precision
  - Mountains: ridges show similar roughness at different scales
  - Trees: branching pattern repeats at smaller scales
  - Blood vessels: branching network fills space efficiently

  Key properties:
  - Infinite detail: magnification always reveals new structure
  - Fractional dimension: dimension between integer values
  - Rough at all scales: no smooth regions at any zoom level
  - Self-similarity: parts resemble the whole
insights:
  - Complexity emerges from simple recursive rules
  - Parts mirror the whole across scales
  - Pattern recognition at multiple levels simultaneously
  - Self-reference creates infinite depth from finite definition
  - The P-Series is fractal - each level contains the whole
