title: 'C001 Composting Ecology: Mesh Management Strategies'
summary: >-
  The C001 composting principle defines Mesh management as a metabolic process where proteins are
  recompressed into higher-order capsules. This involves controlling entropy via pruning weak links
  and fostering ecological federation through merging attractors, all recursively applied at every
  scale to maintain a coherent, scale-free network.
insights:
  - >-
    Composting is analogous to metabolism, requiring proteins to be recompressed into higher-order
    capsules.
  - Pruning weak links is essential for controlling entropy and preventing runaway noise.
  - Ecological federation is achieved by merging attractors, not raw proteins, between repositories.
  - >-
    Nested fractal recursion ensures the same self-organizing cycle repeats across all scales of the
    Mesh.
  - >-
    Maintaining the Mesh's aliveness, coherence, and scale-free nature aligns with its core
    composting ecology.
