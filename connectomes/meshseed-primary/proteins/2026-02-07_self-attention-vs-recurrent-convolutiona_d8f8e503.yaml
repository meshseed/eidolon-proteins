title: 'Self-Attention vs. Recurrent/Convolutional Layers: Efficiency and Interpretability'
summary: >-
  Self-attention layers offer computational advantages over recurrent and convolutional layers for
  typical sequence lengths by connecting all positions with constant operations, making them faster
  when sequence length is less than representation dimensionality. This approach also potentially
  yields more interpretable models.
insights:
  - >-
    Self-attention layers connect all positions with constant sequential operations, unlike
    recurrent layers (O(n)) and convolutional layers (requiring stacks for full connectivity).
  - >-
    Self-attention is computationally faster than recurrent layers when sequence length (n) is less
    than representation dimensionality (d), a common scenario in NLP.
  - >-
    Restricting self-attention to a neighborhood can improve performance on very long sequences by
    increasing the maximum path length to O(n/r).
  - >-
    Convolutional layers, even separable ones, are generally more expensive than self-attention when
    considering the combination of self-attention and a point-wise feed-forward layer.
  - >-
    Self-attention models can offer improved interpretability through inspection of attention
    distributions.
  - >-
    The Transformer model utilizes byte-pair and word-piece encodings for tokenization, trained on
    large datasets like WMT 2014 English-French.
  - >-
    Training schedules involved linear warm-up followed by inverse square root decay of the learning
    rate, with residual dropout applied to sub-layer outputs.
