title: 'THE MESH: Physics, Coherence, and Retry System Enhancements'
summary: >-
  This update to THE MESH introduces a dynamic Physics Modulation System for visual communication
  and dual-layer emotional control. It also implements Coherence Normalization to fix clustering
  issues and a robust Retry System with exponential backoff for API stability.
insights:
  - >-
    Physics Modulation System enables 'body language' for graphs, using physics as a communication
    channel.
  - >-
    Dual-layer emotional control (involuntary + voluntary) and presets allow for nuanced AI
    expression.
  - >-
    Coherence Normalization addresses the 0.98-1.0 clustering problem by using percentile-based
    mapping to the full 0.50-1.00 range.
  - >-
    A new Retry System with exponential backoff and jitter handles API overload and rate limits,
    logging attempts and differentiating error types.
  - >-
    Node coloring by tier and activation state, along with AI-specified physics via code blocks,
    enhance visualization and control.
