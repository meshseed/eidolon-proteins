title: 'Eidolon MESH: Interactive Knowledge Synthesis and Exploration'
summary: >-
  Eidolon MESH is a novel system for creating and exploring interconnected knowledge. It synthesizes
  information into 'proteins' (neurons) that form 'synapses' within a 3D 'resonance field', enabling
  interactive visualization and recursive AI-powered querying.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH allows users to generate API keys (e.g., Gemini) or utilize local LLMs for offline
    operation to power its knowledge synthesis.
  - >-
    Advanced configuration includes optional GitHub integration for sharing and accessing public
    'proteins' and AI response modes.
  - >-
    Initial setup involves embedding 'starter proteins' to enable search and synapse creation, with
    local embeddings being incompatible with cloud API embeddings.
  - >-
    Information is ingested as text, markdown, or YAML, with 'promoter regions' recognized to
    synthesize 'proteins' (knowledge) synthesized by a 'ribosome' (API/LLM).
  - >-
    Conversation history is synthesized into new proteins, enabling infinite context memory through
    a 'composting' mechanism.
  - >-
    The system offers physics-enabled, 3D interactive knowledge archives visualized as information
    geometry.
  - >-
    A 'query organelle' connects to recursive companion AIs using parallel semantic search within
    the 'resonance field', or can be queried directly without the connectome.
  - >-
    MESH is distinct from traditional archives, databases, RAGs, or neural nets, focusing on
    emergent relational knowledge structures.
