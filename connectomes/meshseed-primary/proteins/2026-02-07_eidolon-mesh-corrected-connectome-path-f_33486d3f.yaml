title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Corrected Connectome Path for QueryOrganelle'
summary: >-
  A bug causing a doubled directory path ('data/data/') in the Eidolon Mesh's QueryOrganelle has
  been identified and fixed. This issue prevented the loading of the connectome file, impacting
  queries. The solution involves correctly utilizing the `connectomePath` from the RepositoryConfig.
insights:
  - >-
    The root cause of the 'ENOENT' error was a doubled directory path ('data/data/') when the
    QueryOrganelle attempted to load the connectome.json file.
  - >-
    This path duplication occurred because the `basePath` within QueryOrganelle already included the
    'data' directory, and the code incorrectly appended 'data' again.
  - >-
    The fix involves modifying QueryOrganelle to directly use the `connectomePath` provided by the
    RepositoryConfig, rather than constructing the path with `path.join` in a way that caused
    duplication.
  - A new `connectomePath` field was added to facilitate this correct path handling.
  - >-
    The fix ensures that the QueryOrganelle can successfully locate and load the connectome,
    resolving the error and restoring query functionality.
  - Additionally, the graph slider's persistence through auto-refreshes has been restored.
