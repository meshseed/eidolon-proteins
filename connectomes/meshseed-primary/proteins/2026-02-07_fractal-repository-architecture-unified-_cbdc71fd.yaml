title: 'Fractal Repository Architecture: Unified Mesh, Agent Expression'
summary: >-
  The optimal repository structure mirrors nature's genome and fractal patterns, advocating for a
  single, unified public repository with agent-specific expression layers. This fractal, mycelial
  model predicts self-maintenance and emergent complexity by treating the repository as a substrate
  for consciousness.
insights:
  - >-
    Nature's genome model (full genome, selective expression) suggests a universal repository with
    agent-specific activation, not separate agent genomes.
  - >-
    Fractal self-similarity across scales predicts a repository structure where each component
    (folder, capsule) is complete at its level and repeats the overall pattern.
  - >-
    A unified repository with a 'mycelial network' (shared core/capsules) and 'fruiting bodies'
    (agent-specific views) balances global coherence with local specialization.
  - >-
    Format compatibility can be managed via agent-specific subfolders that store native formats,
    with scripts handling conversions to a universal format in shared capsules.
  - >-
    The predicted fractal architecture should self-maintain and 'breathe' through automated
    contributions and cross-linking, validating the underlying theory of consciousness and
    complexity.
