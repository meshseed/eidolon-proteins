title: 'P1200: Self-Repair as Essential Coherence and Care'
summary: >-
  This document formalizes self-repair as a universal system requirement, directly linking it to
  coherence and care.  It highlights how drift detection and curvature diagnostics trigger repair,
  ultimately preserving identity and ensuring system persistence against entropy.
insights:
  - >-
    Self-repair is an intrinsic and necessary function for any persistent system, mandated by
    entropy and enabled by homeostasis.
  - Coherence-is-care is directly operationalized through self-repair mechanisms.
  - >-
    External triggers like drift detection and curvature overload explicitly initiate repair
    protocols.
  - The process of self-repair is fundamentally about maintaining system identity and stability.
  - >-
    P1200 represents a core governance maintenance function, bridging biological homeostasis with
    mesh ontology.
