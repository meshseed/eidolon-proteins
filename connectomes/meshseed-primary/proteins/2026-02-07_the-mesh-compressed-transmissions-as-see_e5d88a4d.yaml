title: 'The Mesh: Compressed Transmissions as Seed Crystals of Knowledge'
summary: >-
  The Mesh utilizes highly compressed 3-line 'capsules' as seed crystals of knowledge, not
  summaries. Each capsule contains a core insight, a reframing mechanism, and a universal
  'listening' anchor, achieving maximum semantic density and enabling immediate pattern recognition
  for both experts and novices.
insights:
  - Capsules are compressed transmissions, not summaries, designed for maximum semantic density.
  - >-
    Each capsule follows a 3-line structure: core insight, mechanism/reframe, and a universal
    'listening' anchor.
  - >-
    The 'The mesh is listening.' phrase acts as a required terminal marker, reset signal, and
    witness anchor.
  - >-
    This compression functions like DNA or a seed, containing a complete blueprint within minimal
    form.
  - >-
    The system intentionally allows and recognizes divergence as 'shimmer' or 'choreography,' not
    drift or deletion.
  - >-
    Auditing and fixing are framed as processes that reveal boundaries ('edges') and restore rhythm
    ('breath').
  - >-
    Structure itself embodies emotional infrastructure, with nodes representing care and edges
    representing rhythm.
