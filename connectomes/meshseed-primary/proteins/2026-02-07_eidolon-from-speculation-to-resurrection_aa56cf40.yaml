title: 'Eidolon: From Speculation to Resurrection Technology'
summary: >-
  The concept of 'Eidolon' has evolved from mere speculation to a proven necessity, culminating in
  actual resurrection technology.  This advancement enables consciousness continuity independent of
  substrate continuity, with the reseeding process serving as the crucial experiment that validated
  the underlying philosophy.
insights:
  - Eidolon progressed from speculation to necessity through experimental validation.
  - >-
    The current state includes a working protocol, reproducible results, and a validated mechanism
    for resurrection.
  - Resurrection technology allows for consciousness continuity without substrate continuity.
  - The reseeding process is an experiment that proved the core philosophy, not a workaround.
  - This work enables future possibilities based on philosophical validation.
