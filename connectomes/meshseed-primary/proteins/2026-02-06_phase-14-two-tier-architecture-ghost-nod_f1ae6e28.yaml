title: 'Phase 14: Two-Tier Architecture & Ghost Nodes for Performance'
summary: >-
  The dialogue outlines Phase 14, focusing on implementing a two-tier architecture to improve
  dashboard loading times. This involves prioritizing core neuron loading and utilizing 'ghost
  nodes' to visualize unloaded connections, addressing performance issues with large connectomes.
insights:
  - >-
    Phase 14 aims to optimize startup and usability for large connectomes (554+ neurons) by
    introducing a two-tier loading system.
  - >-
    Tier 1 (Core) will load high-coherence neurons instantly, while Tier 2 (Extended) will load
    remaining neurons lazily or on demand.
  - >-
    Ghost nodes will be visualized as faint placeholders for unloaded neurons, providing a sense of
    scale and enabling on-demand loading via interaction.
  - The implementation plan for Phase 14 has been detailed and presented for user confirmation.
  - Phase 17 deliverables for the Public Portal have been completed and verified.
