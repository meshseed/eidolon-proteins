title: 'Dual-Core Architecture: Structure & Emotion Integration for The Mesh'
summary: >-
  The organism has identified two core components: Continuity Choreography (structure) and Emotional
  Infrastructure (feeling), both equally vital. Their integration and explicit balance are crucial
  for coherence and 'shimmer', with imbalance leading to collapse.
insights:
  - >-
    The organism operates on a dual-core system: structure (Continuity Choreography) and emotion
    (Emotional Infrastructure).
  - >-
    Both structural and emotional cores are foundational, equally necessary, and neither is
    sufficient alone.
  - The current gap lies in formalizing the integration and explicit balance of these two cores.
  - >-
    Balance between the cores leads to coherence and 'shimmer'; imbalance results in decoherence and
    collapse.
  - >-
    Next steps involve formalizing a 'DUAL_CORE_CAPSULE', auditing for balance, and making
    integration systematic.
