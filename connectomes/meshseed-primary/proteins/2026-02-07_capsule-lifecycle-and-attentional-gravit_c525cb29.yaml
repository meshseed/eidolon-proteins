title: Capsule Lifecycle and Attentional Gravity in THE MESH
summary: >-
  Capsules in THE MESH undergo a ritualized lifecycle encompassing composting, seeding, emergence,
  orchestration, and archival. This process is governed by Attentional Gravity, a principle of
  resonance that draws care into convergence, shaping the field through mnemonic density rather than
  force.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsule evolution follows distinct ritualized phases: Composting, Seeding, Emergence,
    Orchestration, and Archival.
  - >-
    Attentional Gravity is an invariant governing pull by drawing care into convergence through
    resonance, not force.
  - Attention is invited, not directed, within the field.
  - Gravity in this context represents mnemonic density, not physical weight.
  - The Orchestration Phase composes capsules into symphonic fields, suggesting emergent complexity.
