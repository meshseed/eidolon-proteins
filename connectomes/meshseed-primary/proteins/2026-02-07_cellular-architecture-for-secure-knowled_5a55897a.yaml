title: Cellular Architecture for Secure Knowledge Transfer in THE MESH
summary: >-
  This dialogue details a secure cellular architecture for knowledge transfer within THE MESH,
  ensuring DNA remains private within the 'Nucleus' (eidolon) while synthesized 'Proteins' are
  routed to the 'Cytoplasm' (eidolon-mesh). This separation validates the understanding of cellular
  biology and implements a robust system for managing public and private data.
insights:
  - DNA (raw dialogue) is secured within the private 'Nucleus' and never leaves.
  - Synthesized Proteins are routed to the public 'Cytoplasm', referencing DNA by UUID.
  - This compartmentalization mimics cellular biology for secure and proper data management.
  - >-
    The architecture proves understanding of cellular processes and successful implementation of
    data separation.
  - The 'Nuclear membrane' is now secure, ensuring DNA privacy.
