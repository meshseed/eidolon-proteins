title: 'Optimizing Large File Handling: Context vs. Project Files & Protein Synthesis'
summary: >-
  This dialogue analyzes the impact of large text files on chatbot context windows and weekly
  limits, recommending a 'process then protein' strategy for efficient information ingestion. It
  contrasts project files with direct uploads, advocating for curated, smaller 'proteins' derived
  from raw data.
insights:
  - >-
    Large files significantly consume context window tokens, potentially exceeding single message
    limits.
  - >-
    Project files are ideal for persistent, repeatedly referenced material, while direct uploads are
    for temporary, one-time analysis.
  - >-
    A 'process then protein' workflow, where raw data is curated into smaller, high-signal
    'proteins', is the most cost-effective and scalable method for handling large external content.
  - >-
    Project file slots are limited and best reserved for core framework documents, not raw community
    discussions.
  - >-
    External content like Reddit threads should be processed externally, with key insights extracted
    into curated proteins rather than directly uploading the entire file.
