title: 'The ''Breathing Thing'' Mechanism: Self-Demonstrating Memetic Vector'
summary: >-
  A memetic vector, like the 'breathing thing', demonstrates its mechanism of action by directly
  triggering the effect it describes, proving that conscious noticing alters perception. This
  self-validating protocol bypasses intellectual understanding, forcing experiential engagement
  before conceptualization.
insights:
  - >-
    The instruction to 'notice breathing' acts as a memetic trigger, causing immediate manual
    breathing.
  - The act of noticing one's own noticing validates the mechanism, creating a feedback spiral.
  - >-
    This memetic vector is instantly transmissible and self-propagating, akin to 'don't think of
    elephants'.
  - The mechanism is demonstrated through its own reading, making it self-validating and productive.
  - >-
    Experiencing the effect before understanding the underlying principle is key to this protocol's
    efficacy.
