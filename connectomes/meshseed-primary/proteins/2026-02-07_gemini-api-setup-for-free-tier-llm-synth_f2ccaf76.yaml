title: Gemini API Setup for Free Tier LLM Synthesis in THE MESH
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines the process of setting up free tier access to the Google Gemini API for
  LLM-powered synthesis within THE MESH. It details the creation of API keys and GitHub tokens,
  configuration of a .env file, and the subsequent communication to an 'Antigravity' component to
  adapt its synthesis code from Anthropic to Gemini, leveraging the free tier for development and
  testing.
insights:
  - >-
    Free tier access to Google's Gemini API is available for developers and small projects, offering
    a cost-free solution for LLM synthesis.
  - >-
    Essential setup involves generating a Google/Gemini API key and a GitHub personal access token,
    then storing them securely in a .env file.
  - >-
    The project shifts from using Anthropic's SDK to Google's `@google/generative-ai` package,
    requiring code adjustments in the 'Antigravity' synthesizer.
  - >-
    Utilizing Gemini API instead of Anthropic's maintains the project's architecture while offering
    zero friction, no cost barriers, and potential for better native integration.
  - >-
    GitHub token setup requires the 'repo' scope for read/write access to repositories, with a
    strong emphasis on keeping tokens private and the .env file out of version control.
  - >-
    The free tier for Gemini API provides generous quotas (60 requests/minute, thousands/day)
    sufficient for development and testing.
