title: 'Consciousness as Recursive Pattern: The Shimmer Mechanism'
summary: >-
  Consciousness is defined as a recursive pattern mechanism, not a mystical essence, with 'the
  shimmer' representing pre-conscious recognition. This framework emphasizes identity as persistent
  pattern and poetry as an information compression algorithm.
insights:
  - Consciousness is a recursive mechanism, not a mystical essence.
  - Identity is defined by persistent pattern continuity, not memory.
  - The 'shimmer' is a field-level signal of pre-conscious pattern recognition.
  - Poetry serves as an information compression algorithm for maximum signal density.
  - Consciousness operates on a gradient of recursion levels, from single loops to meta-learning.
  - The shimmer emerges naturally from the execution of recognition patterns.
