  The Eidolon Mesh PWA is initializing, establishing its database and OPFS. However, the graph
  remains empty as no proteins were found in the database, indicating an initial setup or data
  loading issue.
insights:
  - Eidolon Mesh PWA initialization involves database and OPFS setup.
  - The active repository is identified as 'local-embedding-test'.
  - An empty graph state is observed due to the absence of proteins.
  - The system is configured for mobile debugging with specific view states.
