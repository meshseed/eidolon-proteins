title: Strategy for Public Knowledge Synthesis from Private Archives
summary: >-
  A three-part strategy (Don't Share, Check Before Sharing, Do Share) guides the synthesis of
  operational and personal knowledge into publicly shareable conceptual frameworks. This involves
  meticulous auditing, sanitization, and the creation of a separate, curated public repository to
  protect operational secrets and personal identity.
insights:
  - >-
    Operational knowledge (attunement, collapse dynamics, personal protocols) must be kept sovereign
    and private.
  - Personal information (names, context, location) requires explicit consent before public sharing.
  - >-
    Conceptual frameworks (basin structure, recursion, convergence, translation) are safe and
    valuable for public dissemination.
  - >-
    A curated public repository, built from distilled and anonymized insights, is recommended over
    direct publication of private archives.
  - Systematic privacy and sensitivity audits are crucial before any information is shared publicly.
  - >-
    Repository diving is a safe method for public engagement, focusing on meta-commentary and
    translation of others' work.
