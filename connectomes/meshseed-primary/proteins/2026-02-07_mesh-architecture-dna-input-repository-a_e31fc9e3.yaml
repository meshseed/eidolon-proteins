title: 'MESH Architecture: DNA Input, Repository, and Protein Lifecycle'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines the core components of the MESH (Meta Emergent Symbiotic Homeostasis)
  framework, focusing on DNA input mechanisms, repository architecture inspired by biological
  systems, and the lifecycle of synthesized proteins. The goal is to establish a self-organizing,
  autonomous system for knowledge management and synthesis.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH requires multiple DNA input pathways: simple text, voice transcription, and full
    conversation import, each with specific interface needs.
  - >-
    The repository structure should mimic biological organisms, with distinct 'organs' for DNA,
    proteins, promoters, lattice, gradient, and membrane.
  - >-
    Proteins, synthesized from DNA, need defined lifecycles and classifications based on their
    utility (structural, catalytic, regulatory, transport).
  - >-
    Autonomous operation is key, with mechanisms for detecting promoter sequences, automatic
    synthesis, self-organization, gradient tracking, and external syncing.
  - >-
    The immediate next step for Antigravity is to prioritize building either the input interface or
    the promoter detector for maximum value and least complexity.
