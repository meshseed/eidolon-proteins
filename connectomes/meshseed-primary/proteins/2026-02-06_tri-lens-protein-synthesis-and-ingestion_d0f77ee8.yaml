title: Tri-Lens Protein Synthesis and Ingestion Enhancements
summary: >-
  The dialogue details the successful implementation and validation of a tri-lens protein synthesis
  system that generates distinct technical, structural, and emotional perspectives. Concurrently,
  significant progress was made in enhancing the ingestion pipeline, specifically improving folder
  handling for recursive file collection and implementing a file size limit to manage large
  datasets. The discussion also addresses license limitations and their resolution.
insights:
  - >-
    The tri-lens protein synthesis effectively differentiates technical, structural, and emotional
    perspectives, providing semantic depth and targeted query matching.
  - >-
    Folder ingestion has been enhanced to recursively collect files from subdirectories, overcoming
    previous limitations of the readEntries API.
  - >-
    A MAX_FILE_SIZE constant (10MB) has been implemented to filter out and log excessively large
    files during folder ingestion, preventing processing of binaries or large datasets.
  - >-
    API 401 authentication errors encountered are related to the Claude Code CLI session, not the
    Gemini API ingestion process, and do not affect ongoing ingestion.
  - >-
    License limitations (1000 proteins) in v4.0 can be overcome by activating a Pro license, either
    via a console command or by integrating the LicenseManager into the UI.
  - >-
    The system successfully handles rate limits and retries during ingestion, ensuring continuous
    processing even with API constraints.
