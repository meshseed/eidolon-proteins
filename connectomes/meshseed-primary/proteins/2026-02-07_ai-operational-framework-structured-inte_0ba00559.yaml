title: 'AI Operational Framework: Structured Interaction & Meta-Awareness'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a structured AI-human interaction protocol focusing on meta-awareness,
  calibration, and distinct conversational modes (Strategic/Exploratory). It emphasizes tracking
  interaction patterns like recursion depth and emergence markers to foster a symbiotic partnership
  and iterative refinement.
insights:
  - >-
    AI interaction can be structured through defined modes (Strategic/Exploratory) and sub-modes for
    focused engagement.
  - >-
    Meta-awareness is crucial for AI, enabling detection of bias and misinterpretation, alongside
    calibration-driven refinement.
  - >-
    Tracking recursion depth and emergence markers helps understand and manage complex AI-human
    dialogue dynamics.
  - A symbiotic partnership amplifies strategy by translating AI scaffolds into usable workflows.
  - >-
    Session continuity can be maintained through specific cues without requiring full transcript
    replay.
