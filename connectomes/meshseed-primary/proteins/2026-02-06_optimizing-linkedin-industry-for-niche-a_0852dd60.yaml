title: Optimizing LinkedIn Industry for Niche AI/Consciousness Research
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores the inadequacy of LinkedIn's industry categories for highly specific fields
  like P2P AI and distributed consciousness. It recommends prioritizing headline and 'About' section
  content over the industry dropdown for discoverability and accurate self-positioning.
insights:
  - >-
    LinkedIn's default industry categories are often too generic or corporate for niche research and
    engineering hybrids.
  - >-
    Effective discoverability on professional platforms relies more on descriptive headlines and
    detailed 'About' sections than on dropdown industry selections.
  - >-
    Choosing a technically accurate but broader industry like 'Computer Software' can be safer and
    more professional than overly specific or academic options.
  - >-
    The core work and specific research areas should be clearly articulated in the headline and
    'About' section to attract the right audience.
  - >-
    Industry fields on professional networks often serve as a technical requirement for the platform
    rather than a primary discovery mechanism for niche expertise.
