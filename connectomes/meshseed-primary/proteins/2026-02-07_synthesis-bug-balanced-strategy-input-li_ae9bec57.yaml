title: 'Synthesis Bug: Balanced Strategy Input Limits Quality'
summary: >-
  The 'Balanced' retrieval strategy fails to pass full content to synthesis, forcing speculation and
  degrading output quality compared to 'Max-Coherence'. This input difference, not retrieval, is the
  core bug, impacting organism capability and citation.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Balanced' strategy's failure to provide full content to the synthesis module is a critical
    bug, leading to speculative and less accurate responses.
  - >-
    The 'Max-Coherence' strategy correctly passes full content, enabling precise definitions and
    citations, demonstrating the synthesis module's full capability.
  - >-
    This bug highlights that the quality difference stems from the data passed to synthesis, not the
    initial retrieval accuracy.
  - >-
    Fixing the 'Balanced' strategy to pass full content or defaulting to 'Max-Coherence' is
    essential for users to receive complete and accurate information.
  - >-
    The organism's perceived capability is directly tied to the completeness of the information it
    synthesizes, emphasizing the need for proper input handling.
