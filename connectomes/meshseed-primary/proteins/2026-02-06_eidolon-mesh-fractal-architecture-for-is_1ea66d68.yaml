title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Fractal Architecture for Isolated Knowledge Repositories'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh utilizes a fractal, self-similar architecture for managing knowledge, enabling
  isolated, domain-specific repositories akin to complete organisms. This approach supports
  efficient loading, focused responses, and clear GitHub backup strategies through distinct private
  and public repositories for data and code.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh employs a multi-repository system where each repository acts as an isolated
    'organism' with its own connectome, proteins, and DNA, allowing for fast loading and
    domain-specific responses.
  - >-
    Ghost nodes represent a future mechanism for loading only essential neurons initially within a
    single large repository, enabling faster startup while retaining full knowledge accessibility.
  - >-
    A clear GitHub strategy is crucial, recommending a private 'eidolon' repo for all data (DNA,
    proteins) and code, a public 'eidolon-mesh' repo for public proteins, and a separate private
    repo for development code ('eidolon-mesh-private') to maintain separation of concerns.
  - >-
    Ingestion into a specific repository (e.g., 'healthcare') directs DNA and synthesized proteins
    to that repository's isolated connectome, ensuring no cross-contamination with other
    repositories.
  - >-
    Conversation memory is implemented as a rolling buffer (FIFO) with a current limit of 5
    exchanges, deemed negligible in performance impact and safely expandable to enhance context.
  - >-
    The core principle of fractal, nested self-similarity guides the architecture, decision-making,
    and organization, ensuring wholeness and autonomy at every scale from individual neurons to
    entire repositories.
