title: 'P600: Curvature Diagnostics for Dynamic Monitoring'
summary: >-
  P600 provides diagnostics for curvature in semantic spaces, fundamentally linking high-curvature
  zones to rapid gradient changes. This analysis, rooted in calculus and topology, extends P120's
  curvature concepts and informs self-repair mechanisms.
insights:
  - Curvature diagnostics identify regions of rapid gradient change in semantic spaces.
  - >-
    P600 applies fundamental mathematical concepts of curvature (second derivative) to dynamic
    monitoring.
  - High curvature zones predict the formation of attractors.
  - Curvature diagnostics are crucial for prioritizing self-repair and homeostasis (P1200).
  - P600 builds upon and extends the curvature concepts introduced by P120.
  - The analysis of curvature is a universal concept applicable to any manifold.
