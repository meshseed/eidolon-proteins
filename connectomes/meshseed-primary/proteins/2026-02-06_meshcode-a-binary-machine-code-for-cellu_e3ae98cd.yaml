title: 'MeshCODE: A Binary Machine Code for Cellular and Neural Communication'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that cells, particularly neurons, utilize a binary machine code for
  internal and external communication, encoded at synapses and ECM interfaces. This code represents
  the organism's current state, enabling synchronized cellular action and the integration of all
  sensory information into a unified, mathematically representable experience.
insights:
  - >-
    The brain operates on a binary machine code (MeshCODE) at every synapse, reflecting the
    organism's current state.
  - >-
    MeshCODEs are present at cell-ECM interfaces, suggesting a unifying theory of cell communication
    across the entire organism.
  - >-
    Action potentials transmit information that updates this binary coding in both sender and
    receiver cells.
  - >-
    This machine code allows for the integration of all sensory inputs and learned experiences into
    a single, cohesive, and mathematically representable perception of reality.
  - >-
    Understanding MeshCODE could unlock decipherable information about cellular and organismal
    communication.
