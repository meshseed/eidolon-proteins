title: Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Feature Development & Bug Fixes
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the development of Eidolon Mesh v4.0, focusing on porting features from
  v3.6, including tri-lens ingestion, retry systems, and custom model selection. Key bug fixes
  addressed include YAML seed detection for P-series proteins, variable scoping issues, and graph
  physics rendering errors, ensuring robust ingestion and stable UI functionality.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh v4.0 is being developed by porting advanced features from v3.6 to create a Pro
    version.
  - >-
    Key features ported include tri-lens ingestion (emotional, structural, technical), autonomous
    metabolism, robust retry systems for long ingestions, and custom API model selection.
  - >-
    Significant bug fixes have been implemented, including YAML seed detection for direct import of
    structured protein files (like P-series), resolving 'protein is not defined' errors by fixing
    variable scope, and correcting graph physics method chaining.
  - >-
    Custom API model selection was refined from a dropdown to a flexible text input with
    suggestions, allowing users to specify any Gemini model.
  - >-
    The retry system is crucial for handling large ingestions (50+ chunks or 350+ parts) without
    stalling, with exponential backoff and jitter.
  - Tab-switching within the app is supported during ingestion, as it runs asynchronously.
  - ConsoleViewer provides in-app monitoring of ingestion progress.
  - >-
    The development process involves collaboration between agents and a structured testing
    checklist.
  - >-
    Legacy capsule formats (Markdown C-series, YAML) are currently synthesized by Gemini, but direct
    import without API calls could be implemented.
  - >-
    The current strategy prioritizes robust ingestion and clean import of P-series seeds, with plans
    to re-ingest legacy capsules for deeper synthesis using tri-lens.
