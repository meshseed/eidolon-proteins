title: 'Phase 14 Planning: Two-Tier Architecture for Optimized Loading'
summary: >-
  The team is planning Phase 14, focusing on implementing a 'Two-Tier Architecture' to optimize
  dashboard loading times by prioritizing core neuron loading and using 'ghost nodes' for
  visualization of unloaded connections. This initiative aims to improve usability for large
  knowledge graphs.
insights:
  - >-
    Phase 14, 'Two-Tier Architecture', aims to improve dashboard performance by separating neuron
    loading into core (initial, high-coherence) and extended (lazy or on-demand) tiers.
  - >-
    The concept of 'ghost nodes' will be introduced to visualize unloaded connections, providing a
    sense of the full knowledge graph scale without immediate performance impact.
  - >-
    Clicking on 'ghost nodes' will trigger the loading of their associated data, transforming them
    into fully rendered nodes.
  - >-
    The primary motivation for Phase 14 is to address the current loading delays that hinder
    dashboard usability with a growing number of neurons.
  - >-
    Phase 17, 'Public Portal', has been completed, with deliverables including invitation portals
    and community documentation.
