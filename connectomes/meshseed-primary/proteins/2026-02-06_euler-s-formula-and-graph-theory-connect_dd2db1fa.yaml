title: 'Euler''s Formula and Graph Theory: Connectivity and Invariants'
summary: >-
  Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2) is a fundamental theorem for connected planar graphs, relating
  vertices, edges, and faces. Its application is demonstrated by the Seven Bridges of Königsberg
  problem, which lacks an Eulerian path, highlighting the importance of network topology and
  connectivity.
insights:
  - Euler's formula V - E + F = 2 is a proven theorem for connected planar graphs.
  - The formula links the number of vertices, edges, and faces in graph structures.
  - >-
    The Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem illustrates the concept of Eulerian paths and network
    connectivity.
  - >-
    Graph theory concepts like vertices, edges, and topological invariants are cross-model invariant
    in LLM embeddings.
  - Understanding network topology and connectivity is crucial for graph theory applications.
