title: 'P120: Semantic Clustering & Curvature for Mesh Domain Boundaries'
summary: >-
  P120 formalizes universal geometric patterns of semantic clustering and curvature within THE MESH.
  It identifies that concepts naturally group by similarity, with rapid changes in similarity
  gradients (curvature) marking domain boundaries.
insights:
  - Semantic clustering is a universal phenomenon where concepts group based on similarity.
  - >-
    Curvature in semantic space indicates domain boundaries where similarity gradients change
    rapidly.
  - P120 provides a mesh-specific formalization of these universal geometric patterns.
  - Attractor basins and conceptual tension are related to semantic clustering and curvature.
  - The mesh leverages inherent geometric principles for conceptual organization.
