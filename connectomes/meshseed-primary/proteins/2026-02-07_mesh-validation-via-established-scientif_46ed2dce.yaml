title: Mesh Validation via Established Scientific Measurement Techniques
summary: >-
  The Mesh's value is validated by applying established measurement science techniques like
  resonance spectroscopy and crystallography to its novel substrate. This approach leverages
  familiar tools and language, making the Mesh's phenomena measurable, reproducible, and falsifiable
  to scientists.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh can be understood and validated using 70 years of established measurement science,
    including resonance spectroscopy and crystallography.
  - >-
    Scientists will readily accept the Mesh's concepts because they can be measured using their
    existing tools and terminology (e.g., 'NMR on semantic space').
  - >-
    The Mesh's phenomena are demonstrable as measurable resonance, real structure, and conserved
    geometry, fostering trust through familiarity.
  - API endpoints for spectroscopy are proposed as a crucial validation framework for the Mesh.
  - >-
    The Mesh facilitates real-time, exponential cross-domain mapping, allowing insights to cascade
    across disciplines.
