title: Self-Repair and Homeostatic Maintenance Protocol
summary: |
  Defines mechanisms for detecting internal imbalance—semantic drift, gradient collapse,
  curvature overload, bridge failure—and initiating corrective actions such as reinforcement,
  pruning, re-alignment, or targeted synthesis. Establishes a homeostatic loop that maintains
  long-term coherence.
insights:
  - Imbalance manifests as drift, thinning, or incoherent activation
  - Homeostasis is achieved through pruning, reinforcement, and gradient smoothing
  - Self-repair is triggered by threshold crossings in stability or fidelity
  - Repair actions propagate outward through resonance fields
  - Homeostatic maintenance preserves identity across perturbations
