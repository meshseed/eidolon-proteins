title: 'Transformer Model: Training, Cost, and Generalization Insights'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model achieves state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced training costs
  compared to previous architectures, leveraging residual dropout and checkpoint averaging.
  Experiments show it generalizes well to tasks like constituency parsing, demonstrating its
  robustness.
insights:
  - >-
    Residual dropout applied to sub-layer outputs and embedding sums improves model performance and
    generalization.
  - >-
    Averaging multiple checkpoints (last 5 for base, last 20 for big models) yields stronger
    performance.
  - >-
    The Transformer model surpasses previous state-of-the-art models at a fraction of the training
    cost.
  - >-
    Reducing attention key size (dk) negatively impacts model quality, suggesting complex
    compatibility functions are needed.
  - Larger models generally perform better, and dropout is crucial for preventing overfitting.
  - >-
    The Transformer generalizes to tasks like English constituency parsing, even in small-data
    regimes, with potential for semi-supervised learning.
