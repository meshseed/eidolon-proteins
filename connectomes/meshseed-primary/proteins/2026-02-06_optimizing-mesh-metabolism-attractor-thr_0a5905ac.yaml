title: 'Optimizing Mesh Metabolism: Attractor Thresholds and Coherence Normalization'
summary: >-
  The Mesh metabolism process, specifically cluster-based composting, was experiencing performance
  issues due to an O(n²) complexity caused by overly permissive attractor detection thresholds.
  Adjusting these thresholds to be more selective (higher coherence and degree) and implementing
  coherence normalization to spread scores across a usable range are key to resolving these
  bottlenecks and improving semantic relevance.
insights:
  - >-
    Cluster composting performance was severely degraded by an O(n²) complexity arising from
    identifying too many weak attractors.
  - >-
    Increasing attractor detection thresholds (minCoherence to 0.92, minDegree to 30) and adding a
    safety abort (max 100 attractors) prevent performance collapse.
  - >-
    Coherence normalization is essential to spread scores from a narrow 0.95-1.00 range to a wider
    0.50-1.00 range, enabling meaningful differentiation of protein quality.
  - >-
    The normalization process maps proteins via percentile distribution, ensuring higher-coherence
    proteins are genuinely exceptional.
  - >-
    Implementing progress logging for normalization is critical for user feedback during
    long-running operations.
  - >-
    The unexpected result of normalized coherence (0.75 avg) yielding a less relevant response than
    a higher coherence (0.97) system suggests a nuanced relationship between raw coherence and
    semantic output quality, potentially indicating that raw coherence alone is insufficient without
    proper normalization calibration.
