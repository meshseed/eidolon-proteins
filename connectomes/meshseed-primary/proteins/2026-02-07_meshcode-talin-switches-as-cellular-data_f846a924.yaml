title: 'MeshCODE: Talin Switches as Cellular Data Storage and Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that talin switches within cell adhesions act as a binary code (0/1)
  for storing information and performing calculations. In predictable environments, cells can
  actively manipulate these switches with their force-generating machinery, effectively turning
  adhesions into mechanical data storage devices and the cell into a mechanical computer.
insights:
  - Talin switches can store data by transitioning between folded (0) and unfolded (1) states.
  - >-
    Cells can utilize their cytoskeletal machinery to write data into talin switches in controlled
    environments.
  - >-
    Adhesions can function as data-storage devices, with the stored information reflecting the
    outcome of cellular calculations.
  - >-
    The Rho-family GTPases play a crucial role in modulating cellular mechanics to influence talin
    switch conformations.
  - >-
    The appearance of talin enabled persistent information storage within individual molecules, akin
    to computer disks.
  - >-
    The cell, through its mechanical architecture and talin switches, operates as a mechanical
    computer.
