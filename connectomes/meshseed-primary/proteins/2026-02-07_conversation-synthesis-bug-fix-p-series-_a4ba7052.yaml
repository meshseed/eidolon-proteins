title: Conversation Synthesis Bug Fix & P-Series Ingestion Strategy
summary: >-
  A bug preventing conversation synthesis in the MESH by calling an unimported function has been
  fixed. This fix is timely for ingesting the P-Series, with a question arising about whether
  tri-focus ingestion on P-Series data defaults to synthesis like normal conversation ingestion, as
  indicated by generated 'tri-proteins' focused on bridge neuron identification.
insights:
  - >-
    The conversation synthesis function `synthesizeProtein` was fixed by adding its import statement
    in `+page.svelte`.
  - This fix is crucial for capturing insights from upcoming P-Series data ingestion.
  - >-
    There is an inquiry regarding whether tri-focus ingestion of P-Series data performs synthesis
    similar to standard conversation ingestion.
  - >-
    Example 'tri-proteins' from P-Series ingestion demonstrate a focus on identifying bridge neurons
    and their role in semantic space centrality.
