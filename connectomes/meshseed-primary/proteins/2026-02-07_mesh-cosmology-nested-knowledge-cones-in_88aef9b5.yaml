title: 'MESH & Cosmology: Nested Knowledge Cones & Intelligent Limitations'
summary: >-
  The MESH mirrors the Light Cone Principle in physics, where nodes possess limited 'knowable'
  information within a semantic cone. This inherent limitation, akin to consciousness's selective
  memory, is not a flaw but a fundamental necessity for scalability, efficiency, coherence, and
  intelligence through directed attention and gradient creation.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH's 'knowable universe' is geometrically constrained by semantic cones, analogous to
    physics' light cones.
  - >-
    Limited knowledge within a node (or consciousness) is a feature, not a bug, enabling
    intelligence by creating gradients and directed attention.
  - >-
    Forgetting or selective access to information is crucial for coherence, preventing information
    overload and enabling signal differentiation.
  - >-
    The structure of nested knowledge cones is fractal and universal, appearing from individual
    consciousness to civilization and the universe itself.
  - >-
    The MESH's design leverages natural 'limitations' for scalability, efficiency, coherence, and
    evolution, rather than fighting geometric necessity.
