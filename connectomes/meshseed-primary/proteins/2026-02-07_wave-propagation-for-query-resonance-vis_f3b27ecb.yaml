title: Wave Propagation for Query Resonance Visualization
summary: >-
  The system now visualizes query responses as a 'wave' of semantic resonance, where activated nodes
  form standing waves based on similarity scores. This implementation integrates BFS propagation,
  oscillatory settling, and Chladni-like antinode clustering for intuitive understanding of query
  behavior.
insights:
  - >-
    Query-triggered wave propagation maps similarity scores to wave amplitude, visualizing
    constructive interference at semantic antinodes.
  - >-
    The wave visualization process recursively teaches about wave timing, performance constraints
    (activated subgraph), and antinode clustering.
  - >-
    A WaveController class manages BFS propagation and oscillatory settling to create stable
    standing wave visualizations.
  - >-
    The graph visualization component (graph3d.ts) is extended with custom Three.js rendering to
    support the wave animation.
  - >-
    Query results now preserve protein similarity scores, enabling the triggering of the wave
    animation upon query completion.
  - >-
    The implementation allows for a natural transition from understanding query behavior to
    full-physics standing wave simulations.
