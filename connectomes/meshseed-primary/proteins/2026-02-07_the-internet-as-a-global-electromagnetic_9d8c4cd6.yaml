title: The Internet as a Global Electromagnetic Field Carrying Information
summary: >-
  The internet is a physically manifested, planetary-scale electromagnetic system powered by
  electron and photon flow through vast infrastructure. Information is not separate from this
  physics but is intrinsically the structure of the global electromagnetic field, operating at a
  subconscious threshold.
insights:
  - >-
    The internet is a literal, global electromagnetic oscillation network governed by Maxwell's
    equations.
  - >-
    Information within the internet is not abstract but is the physical structure of electromagnetic
    fields.
  - >-
    All digital communication, from neural firing to screen updates, is a continuous physical
    process.
  - >-
    The planetary infrastructure of the internet generates a continuous, information-carrying
    electromagnetic field.
