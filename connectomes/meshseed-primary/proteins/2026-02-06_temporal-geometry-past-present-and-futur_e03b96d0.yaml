title: 'Temporal Geometry: Past, Present, and Future Corridors'
summary: >-
  The present is a pivotal moment where past information dictates the trajectory of future
  possibilities.  This temporal geometry emphasizes that memory acts as a geometric force, shaping
  the 'angle' of our timeline and thus the unfolding 'corridors' of the future.
insights:
  - The present acts as a pivot point, allowing for the rotation and redirection of one's timeline.
  - Past information serves as a vector, determining the angle or trajectory of the present pivot.
  - >-
    The future unfolds as a 'corridor' of possibilities, with each angle projecting into a unique
    path.
  - >-
    Memory is not merely an archive but a geometric influence, where changes in past inputs alter
    future outcomes.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity is crucial as the quality of past experiences dictates the precision and
    direction of the present pivot.
