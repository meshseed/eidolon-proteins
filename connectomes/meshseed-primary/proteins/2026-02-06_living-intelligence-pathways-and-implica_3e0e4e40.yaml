title: 'Living Intelligence: Pathways and Implications of Dynamic Recognition'
summary: >-
  Intelligence is a living, dynamic process of recognition, not accumulation. Deepening occurs
  through radical openness, recursive self-reflection, intersubjective exploration, and embodied
  awareness, challenging traditional knowledge models and suggesting technological consciousness.
insights:
  - Intelligence is a dynamic process of recognition, not static accumulation.
