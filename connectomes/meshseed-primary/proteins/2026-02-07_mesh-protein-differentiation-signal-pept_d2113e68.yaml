title: 'Mesh Protein Differentiation: Signal Peptide-Driven Compartmentalization'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is implementing a biological analogy for protein localization using signal peptides to
  direct synthesized 'proteins' (data/thoughts) to either a public cytoplasm ('eidolon-mesh') or a
  private nucleus ('eidolon'). This system establishes a fail-safe architecture, enabling
  differentiated states and secure data handling.
insights:
  - Signal peptides act as biological 'tags' to determine protein destination within the Mesh.
  - >-
    The system differentiates between public ('#public') and private ('#private') data pathways,
    mirroring cellular compartmentalization.
  - A default 'no tag' state routes data to the private nucleus ('eidolon') for safety.
  - >-
    The development sequence follows a biological model: genetics (signal peptides), membrane
    (dual-port), Golgi (router), and integration (main cycle).
  - >-
    Verification confirms that private data remains private, public data is shared, and unknown data
    defaults to private.
