title: 'Google API Free Tier: Rate Limits, Cooldowns, and Handling Strategies'
summary: >-
  Google APIs enforce daily (RPD) and per-minute (RPM/TPM) rate limits to ensure fair usage, with
  exceeding them triggering cooldown periods.  The free tier for Gemini 2.5 Flash/Pro has specific
  limits like 250 RPD and 10 RPM, necessitating strategies like exponential backoff for graceful
  error handling.
insights:
  - >-
    Google APIs have three primary rate limit axes: Daily (RPD), Per-Minute (RPM), and Tokens Per
    Minute (TPM).
  - >-
    Exceeding any rate limit results in errors (e.g., 403, 429) and triggers a cooldown period until
    the limit resets.
  - The Gemini 2.5 Flash/Pro free tier has a daily limit of 250 Requests Per Day (RPD).
  - >-
    Per-minute limits include Requests Per Minute (RPM), with a 10 RPM example for Gemini 2.5 Flash
    free tier, and Tokens Per Minute (TPM) with a 250,000 TPM example.
  - Short cooldowns for RPM/TPM violations typically last a few seconds.
  - >-
    Implementing an Exponential Backoff strategy is recommended for handling rate limit errors
    gracefully.
