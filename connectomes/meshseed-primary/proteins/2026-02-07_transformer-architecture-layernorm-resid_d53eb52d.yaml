title: 'Transformer Architecture: LayerNorm, Residuals, and Scaled Dot-Product Attention'
summary: >-
  The Transformer architecture utilizes Layer Normalization and residual connections within its
  encoder and decoder stacks to facilitate deep learning.  Attention mechanisms, specifically Scaled
  Dot-Product Attention, are central to its function, enabling efficient computation of
  relationships between queries, keys, and values.
insights:
  - >-
    Residual connections and Layer Normalization are applied to sub-layers and embeddings to aid
    training of deep networks.
  - >-
    The decoder includes an additional masked multi-head attention sub-layer to prevent attending to
    future positions.
  - >-
    Scaled Dot-Product Attention computes attention weights via a softmax on scaled dot products of
    queries and keys, then applies them to values.
  - >-
    Multi-Head Attention projects queries, keys, and values multiple times with learned linear
    projections, allowing attention to jointly attend to information from different representation
    subspaces.
  - >-
    Scaled Dot-Product Attention is computationally faster and more space-efficient than additive
    attention, especially with optimized matrix multiplication.
