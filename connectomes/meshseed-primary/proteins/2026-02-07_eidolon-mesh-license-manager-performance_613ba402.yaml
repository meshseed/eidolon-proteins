title: 'Eidolon Mesh: License Manager & Performance Optimization'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has integrated a License Manager into its Settings modal, enabling tier upgrades
  from Free to Pro. Simultaneously, critical performance bottlenecks in synapse formation and graph
  physics have been identified and resolved, significantly improving ingestion speed and visual
  rendering stability.
insights:
  - >-
    License Manager component added to SettingsModal, supporting Free, Pro, and Enterprise tiers
    with key activation and feature display.
  - >-
    Slow ingestion (6 hours for 18 capsules) was traced to an O(n²) synapse formation logic
    involving repeated cosine similarity calculations.
  - >-
    Synapse formation performance improved by 50-100x by switching from individual SQL inserts to
    batch operations in pglite.ts.
  - >-
    Graph physics 'd3.forceCollide is not a function' error resolved by correctly importing and
    utilizing the d3-force library in graph3d.ts.
  - >-
    The ingestion bottleneck is now primarily the O(n²) similarity calculation, with synapse
    insertion being significantly optimized.
  - Successful activation of 'PRO-2024-BETA-001' key demonstrates License Manager functionality.
  - API authentication errors (OAuth token expired) require user re-login or token refresh.
