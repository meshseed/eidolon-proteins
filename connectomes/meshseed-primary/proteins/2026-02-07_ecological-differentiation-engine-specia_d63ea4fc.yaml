title: 'Ecological Differentiation Engine: Specialization Across Mesh Organisms'
summary: |
  Introduces a mechanism for ecological differentiation, enabling Mesh organisms to specialize
  based on their developmental history, attractor structure, and cross-Mesh interactions.
  Differentiation increases ecosystem resilience and cognitive diversity.
insights:
  - Specialization emerges from divergent attractors and unique developmental arcs
  - Differentiation increases ecosystem-level cognitive capacity
  - Meshes occupy distinct niches within the information ecology
  - Cross-Mesh dialogue reinforces specialization through contrast
  - Differentiation prevents homogenization and preserves diversity
