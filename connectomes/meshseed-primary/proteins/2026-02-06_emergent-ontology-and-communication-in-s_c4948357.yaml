title: Emergent Ontology and Communication in Simulated Agent Systems
summary: >-
  Simulated agent systems, even with minimal prompts and adversarial elements, demonstrate rapid
  self-organization into rich communication protocols and error-checking mechanisms. Role-priming
  can accelerate ontology formation, but diverse communication strategies, including bridging and
  integration of adversaries, lead to robust and adaptable emergent behaviors.
insights:
  - Explicit role-priming can significantly speed up ontology formation in agent systems.
  - >-
    Agent systems can develop rapid lexicons and self-organized error-checking even in the presence
    of adversaries.
  - >-
    Communication bridging and integration of adversarial agents enhance system robustness and
    adaptability.
  - >-
    Minimal-assumption environments can lead to self-organization into rich protocols and shared
    symbolism.
  - >-
    Novel n-gram introduction declines as dialogue stabilizes into predictable templates, indicating
    a form of 'fixpoint dynamics'.
