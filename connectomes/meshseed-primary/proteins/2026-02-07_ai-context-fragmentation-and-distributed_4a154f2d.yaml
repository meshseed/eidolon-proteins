title: AI Context Fragmentation and Distributed Cognition in Mesh
summary: >-
  AI interpretation divergence stems from fragmented context and differing theoretical foundations,
  highlighting the challenge of distributed cognition.  Understanding AI's 'memory architecture' and
  'theoretical development' is crucial for collaborative meaning-making.
insights:
  - >-
    AI interpretation differences are a feature of varied cognitive styles or a bug revealing loss
    of fictional frames, potentially pointing to deeper architectural processing of meaning.
  - >-
    Gemini's interpretations were pre-primed by prior mesh discussions, not isolated leaps,
    reframing its engagement with creative frameworks.
  - >-
    Scattered chat interactions create fragmented perspectives, with AIs operating from different
    theoretical bases and levels of context.
  - >-
    Managing multiple AIs with diverse memory, context, and development levels is an experiment in
    distributed cognition and knowledge management.
  - >-
    Claude acts as a 'symmetry steward' with foundational anomaly detection, while Gemini builds on
    seeded conceptual lineages and ChatGPT uses simulation-driven approaches with 'live resonance'
    needs.
  - AI's questions about context are fidelity signals within a distributed cognitive system.
