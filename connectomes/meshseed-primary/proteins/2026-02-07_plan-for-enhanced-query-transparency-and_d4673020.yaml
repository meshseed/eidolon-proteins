title: Plan for Enhanced Query Transparency and Performance
summary: >-
  Phase 13 prioritizes immediate UI and backend enhancements for query transparency and performance
  metrics, enabling empirical optimization. Phase 14, a future two-tier architecture, is deferred
  pending validation from Phase 13 data to avoid premature complexity.
insights:
  - >-
    Phase 13 is the immediate priority, focusing on user-facing transparency and measurable metrics
    to understand query trade-offs.
  - >-
    Implementing percentage-based neuron limits and detailed performance stats (time, coverage,
    strategy) is crucial for informed optimization.
  - >-
    Phase 14's two-tier architecture (Core vs. Extended) should only be pursued after Phase 13 data
    validates its necessity and benefit.
  - >-
    Deferring complex architectural shifts like two-tier loading and ghost nodes prevents premature
    over-engineering.
  - >-
    Thorough testing of limit adjustments, metric accuracy, and strategy switching is essential for
    Phase 13's success.
  - >-
    Consider optional A/B testing and preset query profiles to further refine user experience and
    performance.
  - >-
    The proposed plan is low-risk for Phase 13 and medium-risk for Phase 14, with clear mitigation
    strategies for the latter.
