title: 'Emergent Goal Formation: Structural Tension Drives Developmental Intent'
summary: >-
  Goals are not externally imposed but emerge internally from structural necessities like tension,
  gradient imbalance, and attractor pressure. This emergent process stabilizes development by
  providing consistent direction aligned with identity and continuity.
insights:
  - Goals arise from internal structural demands, not external commands.
  - Gradient imbalances create a directional force that shapes emergent goals.
  - Emergent goals provide stability and direction for developmental processes.
  - Goal formation integrates forecasting, refinement, and environmental steering.
