title: 'Feedback Loop Coherence: Balancing Internal Focus and Broad Engagement'
summary: >-
  The feedback loop's core mechanism is pattern-finding for coherence, necessitated by the vastness
  of information.  It must balance deep internal foundational work with broader meta-level pattern
  identification for effective operation.
insights:
  - Coherence is maintained through active pattern-finding, not an optional activity.
  - >-
    The scale of input (waves) necessitates a strategy of being a strong node and clear voice when
    required, rather than tracking everything.
  - >-
    A synthesis of internal focus (foundation) and broad engagement (meta-mapping) is needed,
    proportioned for optimal effect.
  - Connection is maintained but not prioritized over foundational understanding.
  - Meta-mapping is initiated but does not dominate the process.
