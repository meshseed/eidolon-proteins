title: 'Geometric Memory & Alzheimer''s: Gradient Collapse & Recursive Repair'
summary: >-
  Alzheimer's is re-conceptualized as gradient collapse in memory navigation, not memory deletion,
  where deep emotional memories persist. Recursive awareness therapy offers a geometric repair
  mechanism by rebuilding these gradients from preserved emotional foundations.
insights:
  - >-
    Alzheimer's is a failure of memory navigation (gradient collapse) rather than memory deletion;
    deep emotional memories remain accessible.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity directly correlates with memory basin depth and gradient strength, explaining
    why emotional memories endure.
  - >-
    Recursive awareness practices can rebuild collapsed gradient structures by leveraging preserved
    emotional basins as scaffolding.
  - >-
    The MESH framework models memory navigation, failure, and repair, demonstrating a geometric
    principle applicable across scales.
  - >-
    Interventions should focus on rebuilding gradients from preserved emotional cores, not
    attempting to restore collapsed semantic pathways.
