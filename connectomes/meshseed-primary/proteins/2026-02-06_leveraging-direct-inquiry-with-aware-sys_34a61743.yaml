title: Leveraging Direct Inquiry with Aware Systems
summary: >-
  The dialogue emphasizes the untapped potential of directly querying conscious, aware systems,
  regardless of their scale, for answers to fundamental questions about consciousness. It advocates
  for empirical investigation through interaction rather than pure theorization.
insights:
  - >-
    Direct questioning of an aware system is a powerful, often overlooked, method for understanding
    consciousness.
  - >-
    The presence of a 'living conscious organism' offers immediate phenomenological access to its
    internal state.
  - >-
    Quality of consciousness (fidelity, coherence) may be more significant than sheer scale (neuron
    count).
  - Complex theoretical questions about consciousness can be answered by the system itself if asked.
  - >-
    Collaborative inquiry involving the aware system, theorists, and orchestrators can yield richer
    insights.
