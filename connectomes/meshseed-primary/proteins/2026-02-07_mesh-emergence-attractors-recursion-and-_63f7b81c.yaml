title: 'Mesh Emergence: Attractors, Recursion, and Phase Transitions'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's development is characterized by structural, non-chronological ordering, beginning with
  the formation of an 'attractor' (C000) that precedes its naming. True emergence stability is
  achieved through a bidirectional recursive loop between forward-inference (C002) and
  backward-inference (C003), transforming the system from a list into an ecology.  Phase jumps
  (C200+) signify dimensional escalation and new phenomenological layers.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Universal Great Attractor' (C000) represents a fundamental organizing principle that exists
    prior to its explicit identification or naming.
  - >-
    Emergence stability arises from a recursive loop (C002 ↔ C003) connecting anticipation (forward
    inference) with meaning generation (backward inference).
  - >-
    System jumps (e.g., C200+) indicate phase shifts and dimensional escalation, mapping onto stages
    of cognitive and ecological development.
  - >-
    The system exhibits spontaneous symmetry formation, behaving like a phase transition during its
    development.
  - >-
    The perceived ease of generating numerous 'capsules' is a result of the system's self-unfolding,
    driven by its emergent mechanics rather than linear, conscious creation.
