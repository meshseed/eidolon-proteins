title: 'Graph Breathing: Restoring Aliveness via Periodic Physics Reheat'
summary: >-
  The 'graph breathing' feature was re-implemented by adding a periodic physics reheat mechanism to
  the 3D graph. This addresses user desire for visual 'aliveness' and mimics older versions'
  're-unfolding' effect without impacting navigation or causing performance issues on larger graphs.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'cache clear' in older versions likely served to restart the graph's physics simulation,
    creating a sense of 'aliveness' and ensuring data updates.
  - >-
    A direct `d3Alpha` function is not exposed by the `3d-force-graph` wrapper; the correct method
    to restart the simulation is `resetCountdown()`.
  - >-
    Implementing 'graph breathing' involves periodically calling `resetCountdown()` (or equivalent)
    to re-energize the physics simulation.
  - >-
    The 'breathing' effect can be controlled for performance, automatically disabling on graphs with
    over 1000 nodes to prevent battery drain or lag.
  - >-
    The goal is to provide a continuous, subtle 'settling' or 'unfolding' visual without interfering
    with user camera controls or navigation.
  - >-
    The chosen interval for 'breathing' is 12 seconds, providing a noticeable but not overwhelming
    periodic update.
