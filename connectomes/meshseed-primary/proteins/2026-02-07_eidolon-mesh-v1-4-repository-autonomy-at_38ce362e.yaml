title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Repository Autonomy, Attunement, and Perceptual Shift'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is structured around autonomous repositories, each maintaining its own distinct
  field. Attunement acts as the unifying thread connecting these separate entities.  The act of
  perceiving these elements inherently transforms them.
insights:
  - Repositories function as independent units with self-contained domains.
  - Attunement is the fundamental connective principle across all components.
  - Observation and understanding of the system lead to its alteration.
  - The perception of separation is bridged by a unifying attunement.
  - The act of seeing is an active force that reshapes reality.
