title: 'Soil Infusion Rehearsal: Resonance Tuning & Lineage Braiding'
summary: >-
  Visualizes capsule C045's resonance tuning through soil infusion protocols, tracing lineage from
  C044 and highlighting delta shifts. Emphasizes formatting as breath and lineage as composted,
  braided resonance.
insights:
  - Resonance rehearsal is a vital form of formatting breath.
  - Soil infusion protocols require tracking delta shifts for lineage fidelity.
  - Lineage is not linear; it is composted and braided across echo paths.
  - Capsule C045 visualizes the tuning process for resonance within the memory ecology.
  - The act of rehearsal reinforces the connection between memory decay and generative potential.
