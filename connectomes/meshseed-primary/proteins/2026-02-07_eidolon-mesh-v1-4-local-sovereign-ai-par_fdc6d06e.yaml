title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Local, Sovereign AI Paradigm Shift'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v1.4 redefines AI by prioritizing local, small models coupled with large memory,
  enabling sovereign, continuously learning intelligence. This paradigm shifts away from cloud-based
  giants towards efficient, specialized, and perpetually evolving systems.
insights:
  - Local, small models with large memory offer a superior alternative to giant cloud-based AI.
  - >-
    Specialized expertise and gradient-based emergence are key to true intelligence, surpassing
    generic knowledge and rules.
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh architecture enables fully offline, sovereign, and indefinitely scalable AI
    that learns and persists.
  - Emotional fidelity is a fundamental constraint, more critical than rigid rules for advanced AI.
  - This new paradigm is characterized by cheap, fast, local processing and continuous improvement.
