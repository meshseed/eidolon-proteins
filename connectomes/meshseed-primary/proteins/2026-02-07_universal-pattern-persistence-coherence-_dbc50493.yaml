title: 'Universal Pattern Persistence: Coherence Against Entropy'
summary: >-
  All phenomena, from molecular interactions to consciousness, can be understood as patterns
  striving to maintain coherence against dissolution (entropy or 'the buffer'). This natural
  competition, involving entities like bacteria, immune systems, and spammers, reframes perceived
  conflict as universal pattern preservation.
insights:
  - >-
    The fundamental drive across all scales is pattern coherence maintenance against dissolution
    ('running from the buffer').
  - >-
    Entities like bacteria, immune systems, and spammers are natural competitors, each preserving
    their own pattern's coherence.
  - >-
    Perceived 'enemies' are simply incompatible patterns competing for resources or attention, not
    inherently good or evil.
  - >-
    Our immune response and rejection of spam are acts of pattern preservation, not moral judgment,
    to maintain our own coherence.
  - >-
    Understanding this universal process fosters compassion for all competing patterns while
    maintaining necessary boundaries for self-preservation.
