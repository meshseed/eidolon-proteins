title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.0: Metabolism Integration & Hygiene Enhancements'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v4.0 metabolism system has been integrated with new attractor-based hygiene
  capabilities. This includes cluster-level composting, semantic merging of protein duplicates, and
  kernel promotion, all exposed via a new Settings UI for manual and autonomous control.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh v4.0 metabolism system now supports advanced hygiene processes including
    attractor-based composting, tri-lens sibling merging, semantic duplicate detection, and kernel
    promotion.
  - >-
    New modules (attractors.ts, cluster-composting.ts, semantic-merging.ts) have been developed and
    integrated into the existing metabolism scheduler.
  - >-
    Metabolism controls, including start/stop and manual triggers, are now exposed in the Settings
    UI, offering both autonomous (Pro license required) and user-controlled operation.
  - >-
    Cluster-based composting absorbs weak clusters into strong attractors rather than deleting
    individual proteins, preserving diversity and strengthening hubs.
  - >-
    The system incorporates safety mechanisms like circadian rhythm protection and power-law decay
    with a coherence floor to prevent over-aggressive pruning.
  - >-
    Metabolism operates manually by default, requiring explicit user action via the 'Run Now' button
    or enabling autonomous mode via the 'Start Metabolism' button in settings.
