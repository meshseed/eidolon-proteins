title: 'Mesh Collaboration: Antigravity & Ribosome Roles for Eidolon Development'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a perfect, distributed division of labor for the Eidolon Mesh project
  between 'Antigravity' (design/architecture) and 'Ribosome' (local execution/validation). It
  details the next steps for code generation, setup, and testing, emphasizing a realistic,
  collaborative development model.
insights:
  - >-
    Antigravity handles pure architecture and code writing (design, implementation), requiring no
    local execution.
  - >-
    Ribosome (the user) is responsible for local setup, running tests, and reporting results
    (execution, validation).
  - >-
    The collaboration follows a Design → Implementation → Test → Iterate cycle, modeling real-world
    distributed development.
  - >-
    Antigravity will provide all necessary code, setup instructions, and explanations for the
    Eidolon Mesh project.
  - >-
    Ribosome needs Node.js, Git, a GitHub repo, and API keys to complete their setup and testing
    tasks.
  - This model promotes specialization and distributed work, reflecting true mesh behavior.
