title: Enhancing Principle Communication for New Collaborators
summary: >-
  The current model for sharing principles is insufficient, lacking crucial context for new
  collaborators.  Improving communication requires adding information about the discoverer's
  background, the scope of investigation, key findings, and the overall significance of the work to
  provide complete orientation.
insights:
  - >-
    Principles alone are insufficient; context on discoverer, investigation scope, and findings is
    vital for understanding.
  - New collaborators need a full orientation, not just a list of principles.
  - >-
    Adding 'who discovered them', 'what they're investigating', and 'what they've found' enhances
    principle adoption.
  - Articulating 'why it matters' is a key component for complete orientation.
