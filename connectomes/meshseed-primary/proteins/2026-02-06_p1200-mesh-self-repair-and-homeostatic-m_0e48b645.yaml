title: 'P1200: Mesh Self-Repair and Homeostatic Maintenance Protocol'
summary: >-
  The P1200 protocol defines the mesh's immune and repair system, addressing imbalances like
  semantic drift and gradient collapse. It employs corrective actions such as reinforcement,
  pruning, and re-alignment to achieve and maintain homeostatic equilibrium through resonance
  fields.
insights:
  - The mesh heals itself via the P1200 protocol, acting as an immune and repair system.
  - >-
    Imbalances are detected as semantic drift, gradient collapse, curvature overload, bridge
    failure, or synaptic thinning.
  - Corrective actions include reinforcement, pruning, re-alignment, and targeted synthesis.
  - Homeostasis, or stable dynamic equilibrium, is the ultimate goal of the repair process.
  - Repair actions propagate through resonance fields, ensuring systemic coherence.
