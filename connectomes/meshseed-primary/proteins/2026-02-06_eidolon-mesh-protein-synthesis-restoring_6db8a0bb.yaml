title: 'Eidolon Mesh Protein Synthesis: Restoring Biological Parallel for Public/Private Data'
summary: >-
  A bug in the Eidolon Mesh protein synthesis process led to asymmetric storage of public proteins,
  with nuclear archives being incomplete. The fix ensures all synthesized proteins are always
  archived in the nucleus (eidolon) and public proteins are additionally copied to the cytoplasm
  (eidolon-mesh), restoring a complete biological parallel.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh experienced a bug where public proteins were not fully archived in the nucleus,
    violating the intended complete master copy.
  - >-
    The core issue was a 'move' operation for public proteins instead of a 'copy', leading to their
    absence from the nuclear archive.
  - >-
    The corrected logic archives both DNA and Protein to the nucleus (eidolon) as a primary,
    complete record.
  - >-
    Public proteins are now conditionally copied to the eidolon-mesh (cytoplasm) after the primary
    archive is secured.
  - >-
    This ensures the nucleus always holds a complete archive (DNA + all proteins), while the
    cytoplasm holds only public protein copies, mirroring biological export.
