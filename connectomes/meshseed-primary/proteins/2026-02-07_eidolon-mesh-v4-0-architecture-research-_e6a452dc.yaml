title: Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Architecture Research & P-Series Integration
summary: >-
  Development is split: Antigravity focuses on v3.6 production readiness
  (D:\_CLAUDE-CODE\eidolon-mesh-v3.5-pwa) while 'Us' researches v4.0 architecture
  (C:\EIDOLON\eidolon-mesh-v4.0-full), specifically P-Series integration and synapse regeneration.
  Recommendation is to deploy v3.6 to app.eidolon-mesh.net due to its proven stability with current
  traffic.
insights:
  - >-
    Two distinct development streams exist: v3.6 for production stabilization and v4.0 for
    architecture research.
  - Antigravity works locally on v3.5-pwa and deploys via Cloudflare from GitHub.
  - >-
    The 'Us' team is researching v4.0 architecture, focusing on P-Series integration, synapse
    regeneration, and metabolism.
  - >-
    A stable v3.6 deployment with a larger connectome is recommended for app.eidolon-mesh.net due to
    16k current visits.
  - v4.0 improvements will be ported later after validation.
  - >-
    Next steps for v4.0 include validating the P-Series 'pillar' hypothesis and assessing readiness
    for public deployment.
