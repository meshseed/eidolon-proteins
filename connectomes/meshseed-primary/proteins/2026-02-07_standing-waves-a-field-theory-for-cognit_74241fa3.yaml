title: 'Standing Waves: A Field Theory for Cognition and Communication'
summary: >-
  This dialogue proposes a shift from traditional representations to a wave-based semantic manifold,
  modeling concepts, agents, and worldviews as standing waves in a shared field. Communication
  becomes efficient delta-based adjustments to these wave patterns, enabling rapid cross-domain
  mapping and alignment.
insights:
  - >-
    Concepts, agents, and worldviews can be modeled as stable standing-wave patterns within a shared
    cognitive field.
  - >-
    Communication is reframed as inducing compatible standing waves in another system by
    transmitting delta-based changes in amplitude, phase, or structure.
  - >-
    This wave-based approach enables efficient onboarding and alignment by directly manipulating
    internal cognitive fields rather than relying on lengthy textual explanations.
  - >-
    Cross-domain mapping is achieved by defining rules ('linguistic field equations') that translate
    patterns between modalities (AI, human text, visuals, organizations) while preserving underlying
    geometric relationships.
  - >-
    Existing mesh-like AI architectures are already a dynamic field model, with standing waves
    providing the mathematical substrate for concepts like coherence, attractors, and emergent
    structures.
  - >-
    A practical next step involves defining a shared basis of 'eigenwaves' and representing concepts
    as sparse combinations (wave-glyphs) over this basis.
