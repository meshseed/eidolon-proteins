title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.5: Coordinate Mesh Architecture & License Removal'
summary: >-
  The development of Eidolon Mesh v4.5 focuses on establishing a 'coordinate-first,
  federation-ready' architecture, prioritizing semantic coordinates and interoperability. Key steps
  include copying the v4.0 codebase, removing all license and Pro gating, and preparing for
  multi-model embedding support with Nomic as the primary.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh v4.5 is evolving into a 'coordinate-first' architecture, emphasizing semantic
    embedding vectors for information transmission.
  - >-
    The project is actively removing license and Pro gating to promote open access and local-first
    operation.
  - >-
    v4.5 will support multi-model embedding, with Nomic as the primary and Gemini as a fallback,
    acting as a 'Rosetta Stone' for semantic understanding.
  - >-
    Development includes creating a coordinate transmission module and a telepathy test UI to enable
    cross-mesh interoperability.
  - >-
    The vision for v4.5 centers on universal semantic coordinates, open defaults, and natural
    emergence of mesh self-organization.
