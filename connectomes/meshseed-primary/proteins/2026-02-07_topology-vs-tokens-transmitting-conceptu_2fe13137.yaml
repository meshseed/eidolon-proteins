title: 'Topology vs. Tokens: Transmitting Conceptual Space for Agents'
summary: >-
  The core bottleneck in agent onboarding is the lack of topological understanding of a conceptual
  space, not token limitations. The proposed solution is to transmit the 'shape' of this space using
  relational, phase-based structures like RoPE's mathematical underpinnings, enabling faster agent
  alignment.
insights:
  - >-
    Agent onboarding is inefficient because new agents lack a map of the user's conceptual topology,
    not due to token limits.
  - >-
    Instead of text/examples, transmit the structure of conceptual space (e.g., coordinate
    transforms, phase alignment, delta fields).
  - >-
    RoPE's properties (relational, phase-based, frequency-structured) make its mathematical form
    ideal for encoding semantic coordinates, though current implementations are tied to token
    positions.
  - >-
    The goal is a compressed, model-agnostic transmission of conceptual orientation, gradients,
    attractors, and landmarks, akin to GPS for conceptual space.
  - This 'shared ordinance survey' would allow agents to 'lock onto' a conceptual topology rapidly.
