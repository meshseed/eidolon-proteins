title: 'Prime Numbers: Irreducible Units and Fundamental Arithmetic'
summary: >-
  Prime numbers are mathematically irreducible integers, forming the foundational building blocks
  for all other integers through unique factorization. This property anchors their invariance and
  connects them to concepts of fundamental units and stable decomposition across various domains.
insights:
  - >-
    Prime numbers are definitionally irreducible integers, serving as fundamental units in number
    theory.
  - >-
    The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 has a unique
    prime factorization.
  - The invariance of prime numbers is mathematically absolute, anchored in provable axioms.
  - >-
    Prime factorization provides a model for identity decomposition into stable, primitive
    components.
  - >-
    The concept of irreducible units in primes parallels fundamental invariants in complex systems
    like THE MESH.
  - >-
    Prime-based encoding offers potential for optimal compression and security in information
    theory.
