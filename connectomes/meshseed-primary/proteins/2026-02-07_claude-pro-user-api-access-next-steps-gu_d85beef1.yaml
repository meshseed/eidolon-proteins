title: 'Claude Pro User: API Access & Next Steps Guidance'
summary: >-
  A Claude Pro user has web access but lacks API integration. Solutions involve exploring Gemini API
  (potentially free) or acquiring Anthropic API access, with a recommendation to investigate the
  former first to determine the optimal path forward.
insights:
  - Claude Pro subscription includes web interface access but not Anthropic API access.
  - 'There are two distinct product offerings: web interface and API.'
  - Potential solutions for API access include Gemini API (potentially free) or Anthropic API.
  - Prioritize checking the Gemini API for a free solution before considering paid options.
  - >-
    The user should communicate their situation and ask for recommendations from Antigravity to
    adapt the design.
