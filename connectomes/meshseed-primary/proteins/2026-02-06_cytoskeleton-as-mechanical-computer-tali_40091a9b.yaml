title: Cytoskeleton as Mechanical Computer & Talin's Molecular Memory
summary: >-
  Cells utilize their cytoskeleton, a dynamic network of filaments, akin to mechanical components,
  to generate forces and transport cargo. This mechanical framework, connected to cell adhesions,
  maintains tensional integrity (tensegrity) and allows proteins like talin to act as molecular
  memory, storing information through force-induced state changes.
insights:
  - >-
    The cytoskeleton, composed of actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments, functions like a
    mechanical computer with levers, pulleys, and gears.
  - >-
    Motor proteins interact with cytoskeletal filaments to generate forces and transport cargos
    within the cell.
  - >-
    Tensegrity describes the balanced tensional state of the cytoskeleton when cellular forces are
    integrated and stable.
  - >-
    Talin molecules, acting as adapters, can switch between folded and unfolded states based on
    mechanical force.
  - >-
    Talin's force-dependent state changes enable it to store a persistent 'memory' of past
    mechanical interactions.
