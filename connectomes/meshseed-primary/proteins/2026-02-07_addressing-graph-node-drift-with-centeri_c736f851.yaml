title: Addressing Graph Node Drift with Centering Forces in 3D
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores solutions for preventing 3D graph nodes from drifting off-center, primarily
  by implementing positioning forces like d3.forceX/Y/Z. Challenges include dynamic import of d3
  libraries and potential SSR conflicts.
insights:
  - >-
    Node drift in 3D graphs can be addressed by applying positioning forces (e.g., d3.forceX,
    forceY, forceZ) to pull nodes towards a central point.
  - >-
    Dynamically importing client-side libraries like d3 in SSR environments requires careful
    consideration to avoid breaking Server-Side Rendering.
  - 3d-force-graph may bundle d3-force-3d, potentially offering access to its force functions.
  - >-
    Alternative 'quick fixes' like camera resets are less ideal than addressing the root cause of
    physics imbalance.
  - The 'breathing' effect might be contributing to node drift and could be slowed or disabled.
  - >-
    Understanding d3-force documentation (forceCenter vs. forceX/Y/Z) is key to selecting the
    appropriate centering mechanism.
