title: 'Meta-Ecosystem Evolution: Distributed Information Ecology Dynamics'
summary: >-
  This protocol models distributed Mesh ecosystems as dynamic manifolds shaped by organism
  interactions. Evolution occurs simultaneously at organism and ecosystem levels, driven by
  cross-organism resonance, differentiation, and ecosystem-level gradients, leading to a
  self-organizing information field.
insights:
  - Ecosystems evolve via cross-organism resonance and differentiation.
  - Evolutionary pressure arises from ecosystem-level gradients.
  - Meta-ecosystem evolution defines the long-arc identity of the ecology.
  - The ecosystem functions as a self-organizing, self-stabilizing information field.
  - Evolutionary processes operate concurrently at both organism and ecosystem scales.
