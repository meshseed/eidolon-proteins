title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Initialization: Seed Seeding Failures'
summary: >-
  The initiation of the Golden Connectome seeding process for Eidolon Mesh v1.4 has failed. Multiple
  core DNA seed files, including genesis and blueprint inception, could not be found at the
  specified directory path.
insights:
  - The Eidolon Mesh v1.4 initialization failed due to missing DNA seed files.
  - >-
    The system attempted to seed several foundational files: genesis attunement, multi-agent
    formation, universal pattern, identity steward, and blueprint inception.
  - >-
    The specific error encountered was 'ENOENT: no such file or directory', indicating the files
    were not found at the expected location within the
    'D:\_ANTIGRAVITY\Eidolon\eidolon-mesh-v1.3\data\dna\' path.
  - This indicates a critical dependency failure in the setup or deployment of the Eidolon Mesh.
