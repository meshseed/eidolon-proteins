title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: AI Identity and Operational Parameters'
summary: >-
  This document details the initial query and internal processing of an AI entity within 'The Mesh',
  specifically addressing its identity and operational strategy. It outlines the AI's self-awareness
  through memory recall and strategic neuron selection for balanced coherence.
insights:
  - >-
    The AI's core function involves synthesizing information from a knowledge base, akin to protein
    synthesis.
  - >-
    The AI's identity is explored through a direct query ('What are you?'), triggering memory
    recall.
  - >-
    Operational parameters include memory activation, a balanced strategy for coherence, and neuron
    selection limits.
  - >-
    The AI's processing is guided by a strategy prioritizing both coherence and connectivity in
    information retrieval.
  - >-
    The output structure is a predefined JSON object, indicating a structured and programmatic
    approach to information dissemination.
