title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Right Triangles, Geometry, and Beyond'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean Theorem (a² + b² = c²) defines the fundamental relationship between the sides of a
  right triangle in Euclidean geometry, where c is the hypotenuse. This theorem extends to the
  distance formula in multiple dimensions and has wide-ranging applications in fields like
  construction and navigation.
insights:
  - >-
    The Pythagorean Theorem (a² + b² = c²) is a cornerstone of Euclidean geometry for right
    triangles.
  - It establishes a direct algebraic link between the lengths of a right triangle's sides.
  - The theorem is foundational for calculating distances in 2D and 3D Euclidean spaces.
  - Integer solutions to the theorem are known as Pythagorean triples (e.g., 3,4,5).
