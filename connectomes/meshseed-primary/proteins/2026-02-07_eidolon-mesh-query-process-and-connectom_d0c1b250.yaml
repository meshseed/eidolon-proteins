title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Query Process and Connectome Interaction'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh utilizes a 'balanced' query strategy, retrieving and processing a significant
  portion of its loaded neurons (22 in this case) to generate coherent responses. This process
  involves local connectome retrieval rather than multiple API calls, with scalability to larger
  neuron counts being a key consideration for cost and performance.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh employs a 'balanced' strategy for query processing, prioritizing both coherence
    and connectivity among its neurons.
  - >-
    When processing a query, the system retrieves and considers a substantial number of relevant
    neurons from its connectome (e.g., 22 out of 22 loaded neurons in the observed instances),
    rather than a fixed top-N.
  - >-
    The retrieval of information from the connectome is primarily a local process, not directly
    translating to individual API calls per neuron, which is crucial for managing costs with larger
    connectomes.
  - >-
    The system's ability to generate coherent responses is directly linked to the breadth of neurons
    it can access and synthesize from its internal knowledge base.
