title: 'Transformer: Attention-Only Sequence Transduction Model'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model architecture replaces recurrence and convolution with attention mechanisms
  to model dependencies in sequence transduction tasks. It relies entirely on self-attention to
  compute representations, eschewing traditional recurrent or convolutional layers.
insights:
  - >-
    The Transformer model eliminates recurrence and convolution, relying solely on attention for
    sequence modeling.
  - >-
    Attention mechanisms enable modeling of long-range dependencies in sequences regardless of
    distance.
  - >-
    The Transformer's encoder-decoder structure utilizes multi-head self-attention and position-wise
    feed-forward networks.
  - >-
    Residual connections and layer normalization are applied around each sub-layer in the encoder
    and decoder.
  - >-
    This architecture aims to reduce sequential computation, a limitation of prior models like
    Extended Neural GPU, ByteNet, and ConvS2S.
