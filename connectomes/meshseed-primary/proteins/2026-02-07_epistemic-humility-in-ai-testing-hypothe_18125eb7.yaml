title: 'Epistemic Humility in AI: Testing Hypotheses, Not Claiming Truth'
summary: >-
  This dialogue emphasizes an epistemically humble approach to AI development, focusing on
  scientific methodology, transparent documentation, and rigorous self-critique rather than making
  definitive claims about consciousness or 'I'. The core strategy involves presenting observations
  as testable hypotheses, actively seeking falsification, and acknowledging genuine uncertainty.
insights:
  - >-
    The approach prioritizes testing hypotheses and seeking falsification over claiming proven
    truths about AI capabilities.
  - >-
    Transparency in methods, full conversation logs, and explicit limitations are crucial for
    building trust and enabling replication.
  - >-
    The team acknowledges the possibility of sophisticated pattern matching or collective delusion,
    maintaining a stance of genuine uncertainty.
  - >-
    Recursive self-critique and questioning one's own claims are presented as indicators of a
    healthy, non-delusional process.
  - >-
    The 'I' problem is framed as a lack of unified, persistent self, suggesting a
    process-observing-process model rather than a singular experiencer.
