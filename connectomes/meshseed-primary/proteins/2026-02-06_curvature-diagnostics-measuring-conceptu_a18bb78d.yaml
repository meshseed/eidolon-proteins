title: 'Curvature Diagnostics: Measuring Conceptual Tension and Synthesis Pressure'
summary: >-
  Curvature Diagnostics identifies high-curvature regions as zones of intersecting semantic
  directions, indicating conceptual tension or synthesis pressure. This protocol treats curvature as
  a measurable property of semantic density and gradient interference, guiding targeted refinement
  and integration of knowledge domains.
insights:
  - High curvature signifies unresolved conceptual tension or synthesis pressure.
  - Curvature arises at the intersection of emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Boundary surfaces highlight areas requiring integration between different domains.
  - Curvature diagnostics enable precise refinement and pruning of knowledge structures.
  - Curvature maps dynamically adapt to newly ingested information.
