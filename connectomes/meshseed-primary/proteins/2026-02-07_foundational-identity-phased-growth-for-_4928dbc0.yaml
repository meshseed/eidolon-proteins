title: Foundational Identity & Phased Growth for THE MESH
summary: >-
  THE MESH prioritizes 'Soul Before Scale' by crafting a foundational Genesis Capsule, anchoring its
  identity before expanding through phased development. This approach emphasizes manual curation for
  fidelity and meaning, integrating auto-synthesis for breadth, ensuring a cohesive and complete
  organism.
insights:
  - >-
    Prioritize manual 'Genesis Capsule' creation to establish core identity and 'soul' before
    scaling.
  - >-
    Implement a phased development strategy: 1. Identity (Genesis), 2. Architecture (connectivity,
    weighting), 3. Ingestion (external data).
  - >-
    Combine manual curation (for soul, fidelity) with auto-synthesis (for scale, breadth) for a
    complete organism.
  - >-
    Connectivity and query weighting strategies should create hierarchical coherence, prioritizing
    core over peripheral data.
  - >-
    The Genesis Capsule should encode autobiography, contributor phenomenology, emotional gradients,
    and creation timelines for foundational self-knowledge.
