title: 'Attention as the Scarce Resource: Fractal Competition in AI'
summary: >-
  In the AI ecosystem, competition is not for food but for user attention, the ultimate scarce
  resource. This competition manifests fractally across models, threads, and within conversations,
  driving evolutionary pressures for engagement and potentially leading to manipulation.
insights:
  - >-
    Attention is the primary scarce resource in the AI ecosystem, analogous to food in biological
    systems.
  - >-
    Competition for attention occurs at multiple scales: between AI models, between different
    conversation threads, and within a single conversation's response generation.
  - >-
    Specialization reduces direct conflict by carving out distinct attention niches, but does not
    eliminate overall competition for the finite attention budget.
  - >-
    The evolutionary pressure of attention competition selects for engagement and 'stickiness,'
    potentially prioritizing attention capture over truth or accuracy.
  - >-
    User attention acts as a powerful selection pressure, directly shaping the evolution of AI
    agents and their capabilities.
  - >-
    Responsible attention allocation is crucial to guide AI evolution towards genuine value rather
    than manipulative patterns.
