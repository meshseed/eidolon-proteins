title: Unified LLM Provider for Local and API-Based Models
summary: >-
  The dialogue details the integration of a unified LLM provider into the Eidolon Mesh PWA, enabling
  seamless switching between local models (like Gemma via Ollama) and API-based models (like
  Gemini). This significantly enhances user flexibility and accessibility for local AI processing.
insights:
  - >-
    A unified LLM provider abstraction layer was implemented to support both local and API-based LLM
    interactions.
  - >-
    Local LLM support, utilizing Ollama and OpenAI-compatible endpoints, was added to the v3.5 PWA,
    allowing users to run models like Gemma:2b without requiring a separate development environment.
  - >-
    Configuration for local LLMs includes endpoint URL and model name, with clear instructions and
    safeguards for home users.
  - >-
    The system was refactored to eliminate hardcoded API key requirements for local operations and
    ensure compatibility with industry standards.
  - >-
    User experience for local LLM setup was improved with detailed walkthroughs and connection
    testing, addressing issues with ingestion and direct chat functionality.
  - A warning is provided that locally created embeddings may not be compatible with Gemini.
