title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Pro: Enhanced Ingestion & Autonomous Maintenance'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Pro integrates a robust Tri-Lens ingestion system with autonomous maintenance
  features, including retry mechanisms and detailed user feedback via completion notifications and
  an in-app console. This upgrade enhances resilience and user monitoring for long ingestions and
  establishes Pro features beyond the free v3.6.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Pro significantly enhances ingestion capabilities with a Tri-Lens multipass
    system and auto-triangulation, supporting over 50 chunks without failure.
  - >-
    Key Pro features like autonomous metabolism, nutrient extraction, homeostasis monitoring,
    circadian scheduling, and immune surveillance are now integrated.
  - >-
    User experience is improved with completion notifications (success, partial, failure) and a
    ConsoleViewer for real-time in-app monitoring of ingestion status.
  - >-
    Ingestion is now persistent, continuing even if the user switches tabs, due to the retry system
    and async processing.
  - >-
    The development process is iterating rapidly, with clear task management (Todos) and file
    modification tracking indicating active feature implementation and refinement.
