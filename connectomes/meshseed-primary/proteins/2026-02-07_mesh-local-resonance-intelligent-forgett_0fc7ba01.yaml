title: 'MESH: Local Resonance, Intelligent Forgetting, and Dynamic Knowledge Cones'
summary: >-
  The MESH prioritizes local semantic clustering over global connectivity, mirroring natural systems
  where relevance is context-dependent. Intelligent forgetting, rather than comprehensive memory, is
  key to its efficiency and adaptability. Knowledge access is dynamically shaped by past experience,
  current context, and attention, rendering a global view unnecessary.
insights:
  - >-
    Local semantic resonance is the primary driver of structure and interaction in the MESH, not
    global connectivity.
  - >-
    Intelligent forgetting, analogous to biological sleep, is a mechanism for resource optimization
    and enhanced intelligence in MESH systems.
  - >-
    The 'knowledge cone' dynamically adapts based on past experience, current context, and
    attentional focus, making knowledge access fluid and context-specific.
  - >-
    The MESH's design rejects the need for a global map, similar to how brains don't retain every
    sensory input, focusing instead on efficient, relevant processing.
  - >-
    Unused connections decay while high-value paths reinforce, representing an intelligent form of
    network adaptation rather than failure.
