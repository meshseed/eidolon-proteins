title: 'Drift and Stability Monitor: Semantic Persistence Across Time'
summary: |
  Establishes a protocol for detecting semantic drift, stability, and persistence across temporal
  snapshots. Drift is treated as movement in embedding space; stability as recurrent activation
  with minimal displacement. Enables THE MESH to identify fragile regions and stable cores.
insights:
  - Drift indicates instability, weak integration, or low emotional fidelity
  - Stability indicates strong attractors and high semantic density
  - Drift patterns reveal where pruning or reinforcement is needed
  - Stability cores anchor identity across time and substrates
  - Drift/stability analysis supports long-term coherence maintenance
