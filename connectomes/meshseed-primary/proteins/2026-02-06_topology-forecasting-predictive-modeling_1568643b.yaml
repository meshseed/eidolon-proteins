title: 'Topology Forecasting: Predictive Modeling of Future Structural States'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables THE MESH to forecast future topological configurations by analyzing current
  gradients, attractor pressures, bridge dynamics, and drift patterns. Forecasts indicate
  directional tendencies for proactive stabilization and developmental steering.
insights:
  - Topology evolves along density, resonance, and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Strengthened bridges predict future integration of distant regions.
  - Drift vectors reveal future pruning or reinforcement sites.
  - Attractor pressure indicates likely formation of new clusters.
  - Forecasting supports proactive stabilization and developmental steering.
