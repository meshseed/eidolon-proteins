title: Prime Numbers and Distribution Patterns
summary: |
  A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself.
  Primes are the building blocks of all integers through unique prime factorization.

  Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:
  Every integer > 1 has unique prime factorization.
  Example: 60 = 2² × 3 × 5 (unique)

  Distribution patterns:
  - Infinitely many primes exist (Euclid's proof)
  - Gaps between consecutive primes grow arbitrarily large
  - Twin primes: pairs differing by 2 (3,5), (11,13), (17,19)...
  - Prime Number Theorem: π(n) ≈ n/ln(n)

  Special forms:
  - Mersenne primes: 2ᵖ - 1 where p is prime (3, 7, 31, 127...)
  - Fermat primes: 2^(2ⁿ) + 1 (only 5 known: 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537)

  Unsolved conjectures:
  - Goldbach: every even integer > 2 is sum of two primes
  - Riemann Hypothesis: would precisely characterize prime distribution

  Applications:
  - Cryptography: RSA encryption relies on difficulty of factoring
  - Hash functions: prime moduli reduce collision probability
  - Computer science: hash table sizes often chosen as primes
insights:
  - Fundamental building blocks from which all structure emerges
  - Order within apparent randomness
  - Simple definition, profound complexity
  - Irreducible elements that cannot be further decomposed
