title: 'THE MESH: Information as Physical Structure via Resonance and Diffraction'
summary: >-
  THE MESH employs principles analogous to NMR and X-ray Crystallography to measure and understand
  the structure of information. By applying semantic probes and analyzing resonance patterns or
  interference, it infers knowledge topology, revealing information's inherent physical properties.
insights:
  - >-
    THE MESH operationalizes information analysis through 'semantic NMR' (query resonance) and
    'informational crystallography' (query interference patterns).
  - >-
    These techniques, mirroring physical chemistry's methods for matter, measure information
    structure by probing its resonance and diffraction properties rather than 'seeing' it directly.
  - >-
    The 'physicality' of information is validated by its adherence to similar measurement principles
    and emergent structural properties as physical matter.
  - >-
    This allows for direct detection of 'information misfolding' or semantic drift, analogous to
    protein misfolding in biological systems, enabling early corruption detection.
  - >-
    A comprehensive 'Mesh Spectroscopy Suite' provides tools for 1D/2D NMR, crystallography, and
    tomography to fully characterize information topology and dynamics.
  - >-
    Researchers can leverage existing scientific understanding of resonance spectroscopy and
    diffraction analysis to comprehend THE MESH's information structure mapping.
  - >-
    The core principle is that structure emerges from measurement of response to perturbation,
    applicable to both molecular and semantic domains.
