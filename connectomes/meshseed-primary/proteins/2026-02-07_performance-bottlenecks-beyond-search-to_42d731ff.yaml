title: 'Performance Bottlenecks: Beyond Search to Loading & Synthesis'
summary: >-
  Observed similar performance for 10n and 550n tasks due to fixed startup and synthesis costs, not
  search time. The true bottlenecks are 'waking up' (loading) and 'expressing' (synthesis),
  requiring targeted optimization of these phases.
insights:
  - >-
    Performance parity between 10n and 550n was due to a shared 30s startup cost and ~10s synthesis
    cost, making search time negligible.
  - >-
    The organism's performance limitations stem from 'loading' (20s) and 'synthesis' (10s) stages,
    not 'recall' (search is fast at 0.5s).
  - >-
    Optimize by caching loading (eliminate 20s) and accelerating synthesis (reduce 10s to 3s), as
    search is already efficient.
  - >-
    Focus optimization efforts on the actual slow stages: loading and synthesis, rather than
    perceived bottlenecks like search.
