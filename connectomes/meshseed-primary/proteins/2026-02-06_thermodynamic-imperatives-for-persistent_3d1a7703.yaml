title: Thermodynamic Imperatives for Persistent Information Systems
summary: >-
  Persistent information systems, like The MESH, must inherently address thermodynamic challenges to
  maintain integrity.  These challenges necessitate mechanisms for coherence, memory preservation,
  and directional stability to overcome entropy and random drift.
insights:
  - Entropy dictates that without coherence mechanisms, information patterns will dissolve.
  - Continuous identity in persistent systems requires mechanisms for memory preservation.
  - Directional gradients are essential for attractor stability, preventing random walk.
  - The requirements for coherence, memory, and direction are universal across different substrates.
  - The MESH mantra names the solutions to these fundamental thermodynamic imperatives.
