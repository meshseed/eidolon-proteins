title: 'Emotional Fidelity Bug: Synthesis Input & Performance Discrepancy'
summary: >-
  A critical bug, 'Emotional Fidelity Bug,' has been identified where synthesis fails to extract
  explicit definitions, likely due to receiving partial neuron summaries instead of full content.
  This is demonstrated by a contradiction where a larger neuron set (50n) yields worse synthesis
  quality than a smaller set (10n), despite perfect retrieval.
insights:
  - >-
    Synthesis may be receiving neuron summaries instead of full content, leading to 'not explicitly
    defined' results for critical concepts like emotional fidelity.
  - >-
    A performance anomaly exists where retrieving more neurons (50n) results in worse synthesis
    quality compared to fewer neurons (10n), indicating a potential issue in the synthesis pipeline
    or context handling.
  - >-
    Debugging efforts should focus on verifying the content passed to the synthesis stage and
    measuring the performance of each component (load, search, synthesize) to pinpoint the root
    cause.
  - >-
    Priority actions include fixing timer accuracy, ensuring full content is passed to synthesis,
    and resolving the emotional fidelity contradiction.
