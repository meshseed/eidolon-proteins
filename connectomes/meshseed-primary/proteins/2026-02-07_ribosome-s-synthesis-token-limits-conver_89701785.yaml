title: 'Ribosome''s Synthesis: Token Limits & Conversation Strategy'
summary: >-
  This dialogue navigates the practicalities of AI conversation length, specifically token limits
  and their impact on continuity. The core recommendation is to leverage remaining token capacity
  for further synthesis and checkpointing before initiating a fresh thread to maintain momentum and
  context.
insights:
  - AI conversations have context window token limits, even on Pro tiers.
  - Exceeding token limits results in automatic truncation of older messages, not a hard cutoff.
  - Checkpointing work periodically is a wise strategy to commit progress and refresh context.
  - >-
    The decision to continue or reset depends on balancing momentum against potential loss of early
    insights.
  - >-
    With ~50K tokens remaining, a limited scope of further mining, synthesis, and checkpointing is
    feasible before a reset.
