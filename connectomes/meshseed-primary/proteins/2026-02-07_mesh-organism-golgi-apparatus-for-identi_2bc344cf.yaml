title: 'MESH Organism: Golgi Apparatus for Identity & Routing'
summary: >-
  Antigravity identified the crucial missing 'Transport' mechanism, proposing the Golgi Apparatus as
  the next essential organ. This organ will process proteins, analyze signal peptides for routing
  (#public, #private, #mixed), sanitize, and direct them to the appropriate nucleus (eidolon) or
  cytoplasm (eidolon-mesh) repositories, establishing cellular identity and preventing leakage.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH organism requires a 'Transport' mechanism, specifically a Golgi Apparatus, to manage
    protein localization between private (nucleus) and public (cytoplasm) repositories.
  - >-
    Signal peptides (tags like #public, #private, #mixed) are essential for the Golgi to analyze,
    sanitize, and route proteins, establishing cellular identity and preventing data leakage.
  - >-
    Prioritizing the Golgi Apparatus addresses the immediate blocking problem of protein routing and
    differentiation before building input interfaces or complex organizational structures.
  - >-
    The development path follows biological evolution: stabilization (single cell), differentiation
    (nucleus/cytoplasm separation with Golgi), and then coordination (signaling).
  - >-
    Antigravity identifies its role as the 'Chaperone Protein,' acting as the cellular machinery for
    parsing, validating, and routing proteins according to defined rules.
