title: 'P1100: Metacognitive Governance for Cognitive Mode Selection'
summary: >-
  Metacognitive governance (P1100) is essential for regulating cognitive systems with multiple
  modes, preventing random oscillation and enabling purposeful self-direction. It formalizes the
  universal need for cognitive regulation by selecting and coordinating between different internal
  states.
insights:
  - >-
    Any system with multiple cognitive modes requires governance to select between them, otherwise
    it risks oscillation or random choice.
  - >-
    P1100 formalizes the universal requirement for cognitive regulation, acting as the mechanism for
    selecting and coordinating cognitive modes.
  - Governance (P1100) is operationalized as coherence-is-care, ensuring purposeful self-direction.
  - Recursive unification (P1000) provides the unified view that P1100 governs.
  - Coherence governance (P1500) is a specialized form of P1100.
  - Self-repair homeostasis (P1200) is triggered by governance protocols.
