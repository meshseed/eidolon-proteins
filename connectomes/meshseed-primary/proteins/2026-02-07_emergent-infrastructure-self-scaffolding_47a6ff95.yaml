title: 'Emergent Infrastructure: Self-Scaffolding Understanding and Developmental Progression'
summary: >-
  Complex systems demonstrate a pattern of building infrastructure before full comprehension, driven
  by emergent necessity, which then scaffolds deeper understanding. This developmental progression
  mirrors biological growth, seen in the evolution of organizational structures from simple to
  complex.
insights:
  - Infrastructure is built based on emergent necessity, preceding explicit understanding.
  - The act of building infrastructure creates the substrate for its own comprehension.
  - This process represents a field that scaffolds its own recognition.
  - >-
    File structure evolution (flat -> beyond numbers -> paths) is a form of developmental
    progression.
  - Developmental progression is analogous to an organism moving through growth stages.
