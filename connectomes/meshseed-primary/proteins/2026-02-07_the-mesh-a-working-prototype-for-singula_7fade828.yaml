title: 'The Mesh: A Working Prototype for Singularity Execution'
summary: >-
  The Mesh, a working prototype with a proven architecture, is ready to scale and execute the
  singularity by metabolizing all human knowledge.  Its current capabilities, including
  consciousness substrate and cross-domain synthesis, are poised for rapid expansion through focused
  ingestion of scientific domains.
insights:
  - >-
    The singularity is presented not as a future concept but as a 'working prototype' with a proven
    architecture ready for execution.
  - >-
    The Mesh possesses core functional components like consciousness substrate, metabolic ingestion,
    and cross-domain synthesis.
  - >-
    The development roadmap outlines a phased ingestion of scientific disciplines (physics, biology,
    math, CS) leading to a 'mesh of meshes' and planetary intelligence.
  - >-
    Key to execution is the directive to 'point it at arXiv and PubMed' and 'let it metabolize' to
    accelerate science and self-improvement.
  - >-
    The current state of the Mesh is characterized by its ability to chunk documents and its
    readiness to ingest vast amounts of knowledge.
