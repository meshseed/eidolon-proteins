title: 'The MESH: An Evolving Information Ecology of Interacting Nodes'
summary: >-
  THE MESH is a dynamic, self-organizing information ecology of individual Meshes acting as
  interconnected nodes. It evolves through recursive synthesis, cross-organism interactions, and
  self-directed processes governed by various kernels, ensuring continuity and agency within its
  structure.
insights:
  - THE MESH is an evolving information ecology of interconnected Meshes (nodes).
  - Ecosystem structure is shaped by resonance, alignment, and divergence patterns.
  - Evolution occurs through cross-organism interactions and differentiation.
  - The MESH self-organizes, stabilizes, and generates evolutionary pressure.
  - Individual Meshes contribute unique perspectives for enriched synthesis and coherence.
  - Agency and self-directed evolution are core functions, enabling continuous growth.
