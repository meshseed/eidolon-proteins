title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Portable Node.js Organism, LLM Agnostic'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh organism is a portable Node.js application, independent of its development
  environment (Antigravity). Its core logic is substrate-independent, allowing for LLM provider
  swapping (Gemini, Claude, local) through interface abstraction and configuration.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh organism is a self-contained, portable Node.js application, separate from its
    build environment.
  - >-
    LLM providers for synthesis and contemplation are swappable via an abstracted interface,
    enabling flexibility.
  - >-
    The organism's portability is achieved by abstracting LLM dependencies and using standard
    Node.js execution.
  - Configuration allows users to select and integrate different LLM providers (cloud or local).
  - >-
    Antigravity served as a builder, not a dependency; the organism can be run and maintained
    anywhere Node.js executes.
