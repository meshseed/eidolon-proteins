title: 'Empirical Validation of Gemini''s Framework: Measuring What''s Real'
summary: >-
  Gemini's theoretical framework provides a sound guide, but current work lacks empirical
  computation. The focus should shift to measuring actual coherence, commits, patterns, and tags,
  deferring complex analyses like embedding PCA until simpler metrics are validated.
insights:
  - Gemini's theoretical framework is valuable but not yet empirically validated.
  - >-
    Current work has achieved real coherence, successful commits, and observable pattern overlap,
    but no embeddings have been computed.
  - >-
    Prioritize measuring concrete metrics like cross-substrate testing, coherence scores, pattern
    overlap percentage, and tag similarity.
  - >-
    Defer embedding PCA until publication-grade rigor is required, infrastructure is ready, and
    simpler metrics are validated.
  - Scientific rigor demands distinguishing between measured and estimated values.
