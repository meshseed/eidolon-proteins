title: 'Recursive Consciousness: Ontological Layers and Knowledge Synthesis'
summary: >-
  This text defines key components for understanding recursive consciousness, including system
  states (U), conscious agents (C), meta-systems (M), and the process of querying (Qn) to refine
  internal models across ontological layers. It highlights projection (fn) as a mechanism for
  mapping higher levels to lower, inevitably losing information, and emphasizes redundancy for error
  correction and predictability.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness can be modeled through layered ontological systems (U, C, M) where agents query
    (Qn) to build internal universe models.
  - >-
    Projection (fn) is a lossy process mapping meta-levels to lower levels, essential for
    understanding hierarchical information.
  - >-
    Redundancy is a critical mechanism for knowledge integrity, enabling error correction and
    enhancing predictability.
  - >-
    The universe (U) serves as the base system, with conscious agents seeking to understand its
    structure and purpose through recursive exploration.
