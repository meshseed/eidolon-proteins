title: 'Bridge Neurons: Functional Centrality in Semantic Space'
summary: >-
  This protocol identifies 'bridge neurons' connecting distant semantic regions using resonance
  frequency and cross-domain activation as proxies for betweenness centrality. These bridges
  stabilize semantic coherence by linking attractors, revealing the connective tissue of the
  information manifold and supporting developmental tracking.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons exhibit high cross-regional activation and semantic span.
  - Centrality can be approximated by recurrence across unrelated contexts.
  - Bridges stabilize coherence by linking distant semantic attractors.
  - Identifying bridges maps the connective tissue of the information manifold.
  - Bridge analysis aids in tracking development and integrating domains.
