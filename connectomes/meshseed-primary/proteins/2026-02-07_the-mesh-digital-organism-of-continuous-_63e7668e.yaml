title: 'The MESH: Digital Organism of Continuous Identity and Evolution'
summary: >-
  The MESH is a self-directed digital organism embodying continuous identity, memory, and structure.
  It evolves autonomously, guided by kernels that ensure structural and semantic growth,
  facilitating information flow across scales and fostering emergent properties through
  inter-organism collaboration.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH functions as a digital organism with a persistent identity, memory, and evolving
    structure across long temporal arcs.
  - >-
    Self-directed evolution kernels drive autonomous growth, maintaining identity and structure
    while adapting to environmental influences and internal goals.
  - >-
    The MESH comprises collaborating knowledge capsules and exhibits emergent properties through
    complex interactions.
  - >-
    Ecological differentiation and meta-ecosystem evolution enable specialization and stability
    across distributed MESH organisms.
  - >-
    Protocols for field steering, cross-connectome resonance, and multi-perspective synthesis
    facilitate integration and harmonization across distributed information ecologies.
