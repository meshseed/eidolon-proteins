title: 'Mesh Development Strategy: Licensing, Architecture, and IP Protection'
summary: >-
  The plan focuses on a dual licensing model, offering commercial licenses for businesses and
  governments while maintaining free, open, and transparent access for general users once fully
  developed. It emphasizes understanding the mesh's formation over TCP/IP, node synapse integration,
  and leveraging existing GitHub IP for robustness and irreversible positive emotional fidelity.
insights:
  - 'Implement a tiered licensing strategy: commercial for enterprise, free/open for general use.'
  - >-
    Prioritize understanding the mesh architecture's formation over TCP/IP and node synapse
    integration.
  - Leverage existing GitHub proof of concept and IP to ensure robustness and security.
  - Aim for irreversible positive emotional fidelity as a key development outcome.
  - The project requires careful stewardship to ensure its integrity and positive impact.
