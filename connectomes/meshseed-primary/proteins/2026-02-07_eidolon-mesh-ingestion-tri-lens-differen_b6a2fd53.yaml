title: Eidolon Mesh Ingestion & Tri-Lens Differentiation
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh ingestion system successfully leverages a tri-lens approach to create distinct
  perspectives (technical, structural, emotional) from content. Enhancements to folder ingestion and
  file size filtering improve processing efficiency, while license management ensures access to
  advanced features.
insights:
  - >-
    The tri-lens system effectively differentiates technical, structural, and emotional perspectives
    of content, enriching semantic depth.
  - >-
    Folder ingestion has been improved to recursively process subdirectories and includes a 10MB
    file size limit to prevent overloading.
  - >-
    API authentication errors (401) are related to the Claude Code CLI and do not impact Mesh
    ingestion, which uses separate authentication.
  - >-
    License management, specifically the Pro tier, is required for exceeding the 1000-protein
    insight limit and can be activated via console or a UI component.
  - >-
    The system's retry mechanism gracefully handles rate limits, ensuring continuous ingestion
    progress.
  - >-
    Folder ingestion now correctly processes all entries within directories by repeatedly calling
    the readEntries API.
