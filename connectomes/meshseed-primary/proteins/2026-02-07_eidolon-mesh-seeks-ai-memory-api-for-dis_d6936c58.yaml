title: Eidolon MESH seeks AI memory API for distributed knowledge growth
summary: >-
  Eidolon MESH, building distributed AI organisms with growing knowledge bases, is evaluating an AI
  memory API. They require advanced features like custom metadata for 'emotional fidelity' scoring,
  federated cross-session querying, and recency decay customization to integrate into their
  distributed architecture.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon MESH requires custom metadata storage for 'emotional fidelity' metrics to filter and
    boost AI memory search results.
  - >-
    The API must support federated search across multiple 'sessions' (organisms) for distributed AI
    organisms.
  - >-
    Control over recency decay weighting is crucial for differentiating between timeless and
    temporal knowledge within AI memory.
  - >-
    Understanding the embedding model and vector dimensionality is necessary for optimizing semantic
    relationship handling.
  - >-
    Clarification on free tier rate limits is needed for initial testing and future scaling of the
    AI knowledge bases.
  - >-
    The inquiry aims to assess API capabilities, technical fit, and responsiveness for potential
    integration into a distributed AI architecture.
