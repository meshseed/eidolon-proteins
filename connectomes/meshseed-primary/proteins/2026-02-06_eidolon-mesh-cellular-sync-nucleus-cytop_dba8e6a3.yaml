    public (Cytoplasm) GitHub repositories for robust data persistence and synchronization.
  - >-
    Repository creation (Nucleus: `eidolon-nucleus`, Cytoplasm: `eidolon-proteins`) is now automated
    upon GitHub token entry in Settings.
  - >-
    Users can specify a GitHub Owner (personal username or organization) to host these repositories,
    offering flexibility beyond the authenticated user's default.
  - >-
    A 'Sync' button in the Network tab allows users to pull the latest data from their Nucleus,
    ensuring state continuity.
