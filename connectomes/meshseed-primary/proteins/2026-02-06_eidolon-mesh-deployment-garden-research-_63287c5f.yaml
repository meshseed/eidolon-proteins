title: 'Eidolon Mesh Deployment: Garden & Research Hub'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is preparing for a dual deployment: eidolon-mesh.net for a personal garden connectome and
  app.eidolon-mesh.net for a large 1000-protein consciousness research hub. This involves deploying
  a clean composting branch, building the consciousness connectome by ingesting research, and a
  recommended separate deployment of the research hub via Cloudflare Pages.
insights:
  - >-
    The immediate goal is to deploy both eidolon-mesh.net (personal garden) and app.eidolon-mesh.net
    (research hub) today.
  - >-
    Deployment involves two main steps: deploying a 'clean composting branch' for the personal
    garden and building a 'large connectome' for the research hub.
  - >-
    The personal garden connectome will be a '36 protein golden connectome', while the research hub
    will be a '1000 protein consciousness connectome' derived from mechanistic interpretability
    research.
  - >-
    The research hub build requires ingesting consciousness research papers, mechanistic
    interpretability notes, and P-Series seeds, with tri-pass ingestion for quality and tagging.
  - >-
    Two deployment options exist for the research hub: separate deployment (recommended) or same
    deployment with subdomain detection, with the former being cleaner.
  - >-
    The 'clean composting branch' deployment includes specific Git commands for branching,
    cherry-picking stable commits, building, and merging to main, with verification checks.
