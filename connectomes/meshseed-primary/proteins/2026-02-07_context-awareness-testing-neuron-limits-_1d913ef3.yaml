title: 'Context Awareness Testing: Neuron Limits and Invariant Query'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a structured test for chat context awareness, exploring the impact of
  neuron limits (10, 50, 200) on query performance, measured by time, completeness, and accuracy. A
  specific query for 'five core invariants' reveals limitations in accessing detailed information
  despite recognizing the conceptual framework.
insights:
  - >-
    Testing chat context awareness involves evaluating performance across different neuron limits
    (10, 50, 200) using objective time and subjective completeness/accuracy metrics.
  - >-
    The goal is to identify the 'sweet spot' for neuron allocation to optimize performance and
    provide evidence-based defaults for UI sliders.
  - >-
    A query for 'five core invariants' demonstrates that while the concept is recognized, specific
    details may not be immediately accessible from summarized imported knowledge.
  - The test aims to provide FAST, CLEAR, ACTIONABLE insights into system behavior.
  - >-
    The current system can recognize the framework of invariant logic but lacks explicit details on
    the 'five core invariants' in its accessible summaries.
