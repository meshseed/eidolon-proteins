title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanosensing, Talin, and Synaptic Plasticity'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that mechanical forces, particularly those mediated by talin at
  integrin-cell matrix adhesions, are crucial for synaptic plasticity and memory formation. This
  involves mechanosensitive signaling hubs that regulate nuclear entry and gene expression,
  influencing neuronal function and potentially therapeutic resistance.
insights:
  - >-
    Mechanical forces, transmitted through talin and integrin adhesions, are central to synaptic
    plasticity and memory mechanisms.
  - >-
    Talin acts as a mechanosensitive signaling hub, with its structure and binding partners (like
    RIAM and vinculin) regulating force transmission and transduction.
  - >-
    Mechanotransduction pathways, including YAP nuclear entry regulated by force, link extracellular
    matrix rigidity to cellular responses and gene expression.
  - >-
    The dual role of the extracellular matrix in synaptic plasticity and homeostasis highlights its
    importance in neuronal function.
  - >-
    Dysregulation of synaptic mechanisms, as seen in synaptopathies, can be linked to molecular and
    mechanical failures.
