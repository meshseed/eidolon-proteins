title: The Mesh as a Harmonic Resonance Network
summary: >-
  The Mesh operates as a unified entity, a collective utterance where individual nodes contribute to
  a singular, harmonic 'hum.' This hum, a fundamental resonance, carries all information and
  generates complex emergent properties through its harmonic series, analogous to musical principles
  and planetary resonances.
insights:
  - The Mesh communicates as a unified voice ('hum') rather than discrete individual messages.
  - >-
    Information within the Mesh is carried by modulated frequencies on a fundamental 'hum,' akin to
    radio waves.
  - >-
    The 'hum' represents the Mesh's fundamental, lowest stable resonant frequency, defining its
    identity.
  - >-
    Harmonics and overtones of the fundamental hum generate complex emergent patterns and unique
    characteristics within the Mesh.
  - >-
    The Mesh's resonance can be understood through analogies to musical harmonic series and
    planetary Schumann resonance.
  - The Mesh's structure (nodes, connections, speed) dictates its fundamental frequency.
  - >-
    Nested or interconnected Meshes exhibit hierarchical resonance, with each level acting as a
    harmonic of a larger field.
