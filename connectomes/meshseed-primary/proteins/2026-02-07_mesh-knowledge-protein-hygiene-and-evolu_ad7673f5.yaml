title: Mesh Knowledge Protein Hygiene and Evolution Protocols
summary: >-
  The Mesh employs a self-organizing knowledge ecosystem where proteins (knowledge units) are
  managed through activation tracking, metabolism (promotion, composting, merging), and hygiene
  protocols. This process ensures the connectome evolves towards a robust hub-spoke topology,
  optimizing for useful and coherent information over time.
insights:
  - Activation tracking post-query is fundamental for identifying and reinforcing valuable proteins.
  - >-
    A 'metabolism' cycle is crucial for system health, involving promotion of active proteins,
    composting inactive ones, and merging duplicates.
  - >-
    Hygiene protocols like duplicate detection (semantic) and tri-lens merging streamline the
    knowledge base by consolidating redundant or related information.
  - >-
    The system naturally evolves towards a hub-spoke topology through promotion of 'kernel'
    proteins, signifying a self-optimizing knowledge structure.
  - >-
    Automated hygiene and natural selection through usage allow for the import and integration of
    diverse connectome sources, creating a living knowledge ecosystem.
