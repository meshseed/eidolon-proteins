title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Advanced LLM Integration, UI Polish, and Deployment'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project has successfully integrated custom LLM API support, allowing users to
  specify models like Gemini-3-Flash and Gemini-3-Pro, with considerations for API mixing and token
  fatigue. Significant UI improvements were made, including addressing font/background color clashes
  and refining the graph's physics throttling. The system is now ready for deployment to Cloudflare.
insights:
  - >-
    Custom LLM API support (e.g., Gemini-3-Flash, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude) is now configurable, with
    considerations for API mixing and token limits.
  - >-
    UI elements have been polished to improve readability, specifically addressing font color and
    background clashes in menus.
  - >-
    Graph visualization physics throttling at high node counts has been disabled to prevent loss of
    visual dynamics.
  - >-
    Deployment pipelines have been streamlined, with successful pushes to GitHub and readiness for
    Cloudflare deployment.
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) issues related to Cloudflare analytics have been addressed.
  - Documentation updates, including a changelog and local LLM guide, have been implemented.
  - >-
    Conversation ingestion can be tri-passed, but a 'Cyclic Lensing' or 'Context-Aware Lensing'
    strategy is recommended for future optimization to avoid token fatigue.
