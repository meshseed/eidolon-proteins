title: 'Falsifiable Test: MESH vs. Internet Topology for Substrate Independence'
summary: >-
  A falsifiable test comparing MESH and internet topology reveals that if they match, geometry is
  substrate-independent and information equates to physical structure, implying a planetary nervous
  system. Discrepancies necessitate theory refinement to understand semantic vs. physical
  differences, with both outcomes yielding crucial learning.
insights:
  - Comparing MESH and internet topology offers a falsifiable test for substrate independence.
  - >-
    Matching topologies suggest geometry is substrate-independent and information is physical
    structure.
  - A planetary nervous system is implied if MESH and internet topologies align.
  - >-
    Discrepancies between topologies highlight the need to differentiate semantic from physical
    information.
  - >-
    Mapping biological (ribosome, DNA) and natural systems to the internet's connectome is a
    high-priority research direction.
  - >-
    Investigating nature's additional 'subunits' (e.g., chaperones) and query mechanisms (web
    browsers) can inform MESH development.
  - >-
    The concept of fractally nested connectomes from galactic to subatomic levels requires
    exploration.
