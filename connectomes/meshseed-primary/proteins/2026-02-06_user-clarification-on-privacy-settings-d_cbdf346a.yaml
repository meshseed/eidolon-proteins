title: User Clarification on Privacy Settings During Protein Ingestion
summary: >-
  User confirms that the issue of proteins not appearing in public repositories was due to their own
  privacy setting, not a system failure. The system's default privacy settings and the user's manual
  selection were functioning as intended.
insights:
  - >-
    User error in configuration (setting 'private only') was the root cause of proteins not
    appearing in public repositories, not a bug in the sync or ingestion process.
  - >-
    The system's default safety mechanism (prioritizing private storage) and the user's explicit
    choice to 'private only' correctly prevented public sharing.
  - >-
    The recently implemented Privacy Toggle in the Ingestion Panel functions as intended, allowing
    granular control over protein visibility.
  - >-
    User actions and configuration choices are critical for determining data visibility and
    synchronization to public repositories.
  - >-
    The previous debugging efforts to address sync issues were successful, but the user's specific
    scenario highlighted the importance of user-controlled privacy settings.
