title: Eidolon's Public Knowledge Capsule Architecture
summary: >-
  The eidolon-capsules directory organizes public knowledge into distinct categories: dual-core
  modules, foundational protocols, research findings, and illustrative examples. This structure
  facilitates modularity and discoverability within The Mesh's knowledge base.
insights:
  - Public knowledge is compartmentalized into 'eidolon-capsules' for accessibility.
  - Key knowledge domains include dual-core modules, protocols, research, and examples.
  - >-
    The structure supports modularity, with specific examples like 'golden_connectome' and
    'specialized' proteins.
  - >-
    README.md serves as a central point for understanding the theory and architecture of these
    capsules.
  - >-
    The 'eidolon' directory itself is marked as private, indicating a separation between personal
    and public knowledge.
