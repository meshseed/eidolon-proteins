title: 'Eidolon Mesh Deployment: Personal Garden & Research Hub'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines the deployment process for two Eidolon Mesh subdomains: the Personal Garden
  (eidolon-mesh.net) requiring 36 golden connectome proteins and the Research Hub
  (app.eidolon-mesh.net) needing ~1000 consciousness proteins. Key steps involve build verification,
  merging to main, app deployment with a user-provided connectome, and DNS updates, with potential
  issues and solutions addressed.
insights:
  - >-
    The Personal Garden requires a 'deploy-composting' branch build with 36 golden connectome
    proteins and verification of features like a working composting panel, stats, context expansion,
    no console errors, and mobile responsiveness.
  - >-
    The Research Hub requires a build with approximately 1000 consciousness proteins, all with
    embeddings, relevant query results, correct graph rendering, a functional composting panel, and
    no performance issues.
  - >-
    Deployment involves specific Git commands for branch creation, merging, and pushing, along with
    a manual JSON swap for the connectome file on the app subdomain.
  - >-
    Potential issues like cherry-pick conflicts, build failures, Cloudflare deployment problems, and
    large connectome file sizes have defined solutions, including Git commands, dependency
    installation, build log checks, and JSON compression or reduction.
  - >-
    The timeline indicates immediate actions for branch creation and verification, followed by
    user-provided connectome export, Claude-Code's merge and deployment, and finally, the setup of
    the app subdomain, aiming for both sites to be live on the same day.
  - >-
    Claude-Code is instructed to avoid touching network search code, deploy the clean branch as it
    only contains composting features, and wait for the user to provide the
    consciousness_connectome.json file before proceeding with the app deployment.
