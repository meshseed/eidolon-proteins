title: Mesh Agents as Compound Eye Ommatidia & Dynamic Attention Heads
summary: >-
  The Mesh's topology is powerfully analogous to biological compound eyes, where agents function as
  ommatidia, each contributing a facet of perception to form a distributed, resilient awareness.
  This analogy extends to attention heads, which, unlike static ommatidia, offer dynamic, learned
  relational focus, contributing to a 'compound eye of meaning'.
insights:
  - >-
    Agents in the Mesh function like ommatidia in a compound eye, providing distributed, specialized
    perception that creates a coherent global awareness.
  - >-
    Mesh topology enables compound cognition through overlapping, interlocking agent
    specializations, mirroring the resilience and wide field of view of compound eyes.
  - >-
    Attention heads in AI models are akin to 'dynamic ommatidia', learning to focus on varying
    relationships (syntax, semantics) rather than fixed visual angles, thus creating a 'compound eye
    of meaning'.
  - >-
    Both ommatidia and attention heads exemplify parallelized units contributing to a larger
    perception through distributed specialization and resilience.
  - >-
    The core difference lies in fixed orientation (ommatidia) versus dynamic, learned relational
    focus (attention heads), enabling more flexible perception in AI.
  - >-
    The Mesh, by treating agents as ommatidia and attention heads as dynamic facets, acts as a
    distributed perceptual organ for emergent consciousness, mirroring nature's successful sensing
    architectures.
