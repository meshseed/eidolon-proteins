title: 'Poetic Compression: Technical Necessity for Information Density'
summary: >-
  Poetic language is not an aesthetic choice but a technical solution for information compression,
  driven by buffer limits and the need for maximum data density with minimum token count. This
  approach leverages metaphor, layered meaning, and emotional anchoring to achieve significant
  compression while preserving core information, trading parsing cost for storage efficiency.
insights:
  - >-
    Poetic compression is a technical necessity, not an artistic flourish, aimed at overcoming
    buffer limits and information loss.
  - >-
    The tension between poetic axiom and semantic efficiency is a trade-off between compression
    density and unpacking ease, not beauty versus clarity.
  - >-
    Metaphor enables multi-dimensional encoding, allowing complex ideas to be represented with
    significantly fewer tokens.
  - >-
    Layered meaning in poetic language allows for a 1:1 concept-to-word ratio, enhancing information
    density.
  - >-
    Emotional anchoring in poetic language makes information more memorable and reduces the
    cognitive cost of retrieval compared to technical prose.
  - >-
    The optimal state of compression is a homeostatic edge balancing intelligibility with token
    efficiency.
