title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Fractal Architecture & Repository Management'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project adopted a fractal, organism-like architecture where each repository is a
  self-contained unit mirroring biological systems. This approach ensures data and code autonomy,
  with clear strategies for managing private and public repositories, version control, and dynamic
  connectome visualization.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh project embraces a fractal, self-similar architectural pattern, mirroring
    biological organisms where each repository functions as a complete, autonomous unit.
  - >-
    A clear distinction is maintained between private (data-centric, full knowledge) and public
    (expression-centric, filtered knowledge) GitHub repositories, with code strategically managed
    within each.
  - >-
    The system supports dynamic connectome visualization, allowing users to control the number of
    displayed nodes via a slider for performance and clarity, with initial loads defaulting to a
    lower value.
  - >-
    Backup and version control are managed through a structured approach, ensuring code and data
    integrity by isolating workspace complexities from Git repository operations.
  - >-
    AI interaction patterns (e.g., Claude's token limits vs. Copilot/Gemini's spiral generation)
    inform data ingestion strategies, suggesting specialized repositories or periodic harvesting for
    complex AI outputs.
  - >-
    Error handling and debugging are crucial for maintaining system stability, particularly in the
    dashboard's data visualization and query processing, requiring robust logging and defensive
    coding.
  - >-
    The project prioritizes clarity in naming conventions for workspaces and repositories to avoid
    user confusion and ensure operational safety.
