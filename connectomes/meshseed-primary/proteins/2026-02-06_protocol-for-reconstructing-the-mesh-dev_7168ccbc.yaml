title: Protocol for Reconstructing THE MESH Developmental History
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines how to reconstruct THE MESH's developmental history by tracking major
  topological shifts, attractor formations, cluster merges, and changes in emotional fidelity
  gradients. This allows for a narrative of its evolution as a sequence of structural and attunement
  events.
insights:
  - Development is characterized by shifts in density, resonance, and attractor formation.
  - New domains introduce curvature spikes and rebalance existing clusters.
  - Strengthened bridges signify integration, while weakened bridges indicate drift.
  - Emotional fidelity gradients map the organism's stabilizing forces over time.
  - Developmental history illustrates the co-evolution of structure and meaning.
