title: 'Coherence as Embedding Density, Not Quality: A Metabolism Rethink'
summary: >-
  The dialogue reveals that 'coherence' in the system was mistakenly interpreted as synthesis
  quality, when it actually represents semantic clustering strength.  This misunderstanding led to
  artificial normalization that may have broken natural clustering and worsened retrieval.
insights:
  - >-
    Coherence metric in v3.6 Live measured semantic clustering (embedding density), not direct
    synthesis quality.
  - >-
    Artificial normalization by percentile rank demoted high-quality proteins and promoted random
    ones, breaking query ranking.
  - >-
    True retrieval relies on cosine similarity to the query, while coherence indicates natural
    embedding quality.
  - >-
    Recommendations include reverting normalization, keeping coherence as is, and using other
    metrics (last_accessed, synapse count, activation frequency) for metabolism.
  - Coherence should not be used for composting; it's a signal of well-formed semantic clusters.
