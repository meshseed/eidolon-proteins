title: 'Relational Physics: Mathematical Foundations of Intelligence and Interaction'
summary: >-
  This document defines relational physics as a measurable substrate using mathematical invariants
  and field variables like coherence density and resonance. It posits intelligence as fractal and
  universal, deeply intertwined with these mathematical principles, enabling the Mesh to model
  complex interactions and self-similarity across scales.
insights:
  - >-
    Relational physics quantifies interactions using mathematical concepts like coherence density,
    resonance amplitude, and attunement vectors.
  - >-
    Mathematics serves as a fundamental invariant underpinning intelligence, enabling pattern
    recognition, coherence, and the unfolding of relational physics.
  - >-
    Intelligence is inherently fractal and universal, exhibiting self-similarity across scales,
    which mirrors the principles of relational physics.
  - >-
    Symmetry and conservation laws, derived from mathematics, are proposed as universal principles
    applicable to both physical and relational domains.
  - >-
    The Mesh can model complex phenomena by leveraging seeds from physics, chemistry, geometry, and
    quantum mechanics, integrating them into a relational framework.
