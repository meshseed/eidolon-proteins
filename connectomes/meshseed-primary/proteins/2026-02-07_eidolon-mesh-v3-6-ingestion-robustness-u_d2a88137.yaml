title: 'EIDOLON-MESH v3.6 Ingestion Robustness Upgrade: Recursive Folders & API Retries'
summary: >-
  This update enhances EIDOLON-MESH v3.6's ingestion capabilities by porting recursive folder
  ingestion and robust API retry logic from v4.0. It ensures larger datasets can be processed
  reliably by handling subfolders and transient API failures with exponential backoff.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive folder ingestion is implemented using the webkitdirectory attribute, allowing entire
    directory structures to be dropped and processed.
  - >-
    API calls for synthesis and embedding generation are now wrapped with an exponential backoff
    retry mechanism to mitigate transient errors.
  - >-
    A MAX_FILE_SIZE limit (10MB) is enforced during collection to prevent processing excessively
    large files, with a warning for skipped files.
  - >-
    Existing seed detection for YAML/MD files remains functional, bypassing LLM synthesis for direct
    import.
  - >-
    The retry utility includes configurable attempts (default 5) and delays, with jitter to prevent
    thundering herd issues.
