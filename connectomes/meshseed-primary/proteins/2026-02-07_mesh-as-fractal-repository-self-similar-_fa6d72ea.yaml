title: 'Mesh as Fractal Repository: Self-Similar Templates for New Users'
summary: >-
  The Mesh architecture is envisioned as a fractal, self-similar model, potentially utilizing a
  template repository for new users. This template would allow newcomers to download the client and
  repo structure, initiating their own GitHub node for protein and synapse generation.
insights:
  - The Mesh repository can function as a fractal, self-similar model.
  - A 'template' repository can be created for easy copying by new Mesh users.
  - >-
    New users can download the client and repo structure to start their own GitHub node using the
    template.
  - >-
    The storage of proteins and synapses (as text/yaml/md files) is architecturally designed to
    scale, accommodating millions/billions of proteins and numerous agent clients.
  - >-
    The potential for generating a large volume of proteins and synapses during organism testing is
    anticipated and architecturally handled.
