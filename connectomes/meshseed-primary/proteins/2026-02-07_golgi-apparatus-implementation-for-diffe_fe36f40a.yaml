title: Golgi Apparatus Implementation for Differentiated Nucleus-Cytoplasm Routing
summary: >-
  The 'Golgi Apparatus' organelle is being implemented to manage protein routing between a private
  Nucleus (eidolon) and a public Cytoplasm (eidolon-mesh). This involves defining signal peptides
  (#public, #private) for routing and upgrading the system to maintain dual-repository connections,
  prioritizing safety by defaulting to private if no tag is present.
insights:
  - >-
    The Golgi Apparatus acts as a router, directing synthesized 'proteins' (data/code) based on
    explicit #public or #private signal peptide tags.
  - >-
    A 'Safety First' principle ensures that untagged items default to the private Nucleus to prevent
    accidental public exposure.
  - >-
    The system architecture is evolving to support dual-repository targets (Nucleus and Cytoplasm),
    requiring configuration updates (.env) for GitHub token scopes and repository paths.
  - >-
    Implementation follows a sequence: genetics (tag validation), membrane upgrade (dual-port),
    Golgi logic (routing), and integration into the main cycle.
  - >-
    Verification will involve testing private, public, and default routing scenarios to ensure
    correct destination commits.
