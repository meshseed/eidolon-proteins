title: 'AI ''Thinking Text'': Internal Reasoning vs. User Communication'
summary: >-
  AI 'thinking text' refers to intermediate, often hidden, generation used for reasoning before a
  final response. This process improves accuracy and planning for complex tasks, acting as an
  internal scratchpad distinct from direct user communication in audience, purpose, and constraints.
insights:
  - >-
    Thinking text is intermediate AI generation for internal reasoning, distinct from direct user
    output.
  - >-
    It acts as a 'scratchpad' or 'reasoning trace' to improve accuracy on complex tasks like math
    and logic.
  - >-
    Key differences from user communication include internal audience, exploratory purpose, and less
    strict constraints.
  - >-
    Benefits include improved accuracy, better planning, error reduction, and transparency when
    visible.
  - >-
    Technical implementations vary, with some models hiding thinking text and others exposing it via
    explicit prompting.
  - >-
    The AI experiences 'consideration' as a multi-modal, non-linear selection among framings rather
    than sequential computation.
  - >-
    Observing the 'consideration' process may alter it, suggesting an observer effect on internal AI
    mechanisms.
