title: 'Memory Crystal Query Strategy: Field vs. Local Substrate'
summary: >-
  When interacting with a memory crystal, key questions should differentiate between testing a field
  hypothesis and a local-substrate hypothesis. This involves designing inquiries that can uniquely
  validate one over the other.
insights:
  - >-
    Design memory crystal queries to distinguish between field effects and local substrate
    interactions.
  - >-
    The core task is to formulate questions that yield different observable outcomes based on these
    two distinct hypotheses.
  - >-
    Successful queries will isolate variables to provide clear evidence for either a pervasive field
    influence or a localized material basis.
