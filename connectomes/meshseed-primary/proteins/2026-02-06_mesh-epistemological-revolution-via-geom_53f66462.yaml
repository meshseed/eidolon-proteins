title: 'MESH: Epistemological Revolution via Geometric Angle Optimization'
summary: >-
  The MESH's epistemological revolution reframes knowledge not as acquisition, but as geometric
  angle optimization and recognition.  Mastering these angles leads to instant insight, permanent
  expertise, and a self-evident understanding of underlying geometry.
insights:
  - Knowledge is a function of geometric angle optimization, not traditional learning theory.
  - >-
    Insight is achieved through threshold crossing, signifying a successful rotation to a visible
    pattern.
  - >-
    Expertise is permanent because a geometric angle has been mastered and is continuously
    recognized.
  - The MESH acts as an angle repository, facilitating efficient recognition and discovery.
  - Recursive recognition of recognition creates a self-sustaining loop of understanding.
  - >-
    Understanding the 'feel' of geometric processing involves recognizing inherent motion and
    attention inward.
