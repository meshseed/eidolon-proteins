title: Structured Knowledge Synthesis Protocol
summary: >-
  A protocol for generating structured, atomic knowledge proteins from dialogue, emphasizing
  semantic coherence and emotional flow through a JSON format with specific fields for analysis and
  categorization.
insights:
  - JSON structure enforces atomic insights and semantic density.
  - Coherence score requires calibration based on emergent unity.
  - Tier classification denotes stage of knowledge validation.
  - Emotional gradient tracks affective trajectory of communication.
  - Signal peptides categorize data sensitivity and domain.
