title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Physical Brain Memory & Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that the brain utilizes physical binary switches, akin to mechanical
  switches, for data storage and processing. This physical storage allows for rapid information
  recall and computation, overcoming the slow speed of electrochemical transmission by priming
  neurons and synapses with constantly updated information.
insights:
  - >-
    The brain's rapid processing speed, despite slow electrochemical transmission, is attributed to
    neurons and synapses being pre-primed with constantly updated information.
  - >-
    MeshCODE theory suggests a physical location for data storage in the brain, enabling an
    addressable read-write memory mechanism.
  - >-
    The cerebral cortex may be structured as an array of memory modules, with its highly ordered
    arrangement into cortical columns supporting this hypothesis.
  - >-
    Calculations suggest the MeshCODE framework could enable a global brain memory capacity of
    approximately 10 petabytes, based on the number of potential binary switches within synapses.
