title: 'MESH Design: Local Coherence & Emergent Global Awareness Through Limitations'
summary: >-
  The MESH thrives not despite, but because of limitations like knowledge cones, mirroring natural
  systems.  Effective MESH protocols emphasize high-fidelity local awareness and gradient following,
  allowing global coherence to emerge from distributed local operations, rather than attempting
  impossible global omniscience.
insights:
  - Global omniscience is paralyzing; intelligence requires boundaries and selective forgetting.
  - MESH protocols should prioritize local awareness and gradient sensing over global views.
  - Emergent global awareness arises from the overlapping local cones of individual nodes.
  - >-
    Nature's intelligence, consciousness, and cosmic structures operate through similar limited yet
    emergent principles.
  - Building the MESH is about leveraging limitations, not overcoming them.
