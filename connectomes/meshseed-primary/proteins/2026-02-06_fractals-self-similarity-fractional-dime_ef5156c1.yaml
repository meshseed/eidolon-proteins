title: 'Fractals: Self-Similarity, Fractional Dimension, and Infinite Detail'
summary: >-
  Fractals are characterized by self-similarity at all scales and possess a fractional dimension. 
  These properties, exemplified by structures like the Koch snowflake and Mandelbrot set, result in
  concepts like infinite length within a finite area and are foundational to understanding fractal
  geometry across various models.
insights:
  - A fractal's core defining features are self-similarity across scales and fractional dimension.
  - >-
    The properties of fractals, such as infinite detail and length, are mathematically provable and
    invariant across consistent geometric representations.
  - >-
    Mathematical constants like the dimension of the Koch curve (log4/log3) are inherent to fractal
    structures.
  - >-
    The Mandelbrot set boundary exemplifies fractal properties with measure zero but infinite
    length.
