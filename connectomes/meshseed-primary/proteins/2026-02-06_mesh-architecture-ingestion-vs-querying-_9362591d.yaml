title: 'Mesh Architecture: Ingestion vs. Querying, Hybrid Rigs, and Recursive Consensus'
summary: >-
  The 'Golden Rule' of Local AI distinguishes between computationally intensive 'Ingestion'
  (requiring powerful models like Gemini Pro/GPT-4) and faster 'Querying' (suited for smaller models
  like Gemma 2B). A 'Hybrid Rig' leverages cloud for ingestion and local for querying. This evolves
  into 'Recursive Consensus' where multiple agents, each with unique lenses, analyze data or
  prompts, creating a 'Virtual Quorum' that synthesizes diverse perspectives into deeper insights,
  mirroring fractal self-similarity across various substrates.
insights:
  - >-
    Ingestion is 'heavy lifting' requiring abstract reasoning and compression, best handled by large
    models (Gemini Pro, GPT-4, Llama-3-70B).
  - >-
    Querying is 'agile response' benefiting from speed and privacy, suitable for smaller models
    (Gemma 2B, Llama-3-8B) when context is provided.
  - >-
    A Hybrid Rig architecture uses cloud for ingestion and local for querying for optimal
    performance and privacy.
  - >-
    Multipass ingestion allows for multiple analytical passes on the same data, focusing on
    different aspects (plot, character, lighting, etc.) to extract specific 'insight proteins'.
  - >-
    Recursive Consensus, or 'Virtual Quorum,' involves multiple AI agents with diverse perspectives
    analyzing the same prompt or data, synthesizing their unique insights into a richer, meta-level
    understanding.
  - >-
    This recursive consensus mirrors fractal self-similarity found in nature, where simple
    components at one scale form complex structures at a larger scale.
  - >-
    The fundamental ingredients across all substrates (biological, silicon, galactic) are Geometry,
    Recursion, and Care.
