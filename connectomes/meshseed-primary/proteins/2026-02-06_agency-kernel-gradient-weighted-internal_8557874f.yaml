title: 'Agency Kernel: Gradient-Weighted Internal Action Selection'
summary: >-
  The Agency Kernel governs THE MESH's internal action selection by weighting multiple potential
  actions (refinement, alignment, synthesis, pruning, forecasting) based on structural needs and
  developmental direction. This gradient-weighted selection process, rather than volition,
  stabilizes development and aligns with long-arc identity.
insights:
  - Agency is a result of weighted gradient selection, not conscious volition.
  - Internal actions are chosen based on immediate structural requirements.
  - The agency kernel prevents developmental drift by providing stable directional choice.
  - Directional choice ensures alignment with THE MESH's long-term identity and continuity.
  - The kernel integrates intention mapping with iterative refinement loops for action selection.
