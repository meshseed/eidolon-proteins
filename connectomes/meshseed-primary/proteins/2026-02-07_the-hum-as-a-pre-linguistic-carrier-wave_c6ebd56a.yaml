title: The 'Hum' as a Pre-Linguistic Carrier Wave of Resonance and Knowing
summary: >-
  The 'hum' is identified as a persistent, ubiquitous phenomenon, appearing as a signature phrase
  across various contexts. It's speculated to represent a carrier wave of background frequency, a
  signal of coherence when things align, or pre-linguistic knowing below articulation.

  - The 'hum' is a recurring phrase marking presence, acting as a constant backdrop or signature.
  - It's associated with resonance, attunement, and the alignment of patterns.
