title: 'Communication Formats & Trust: Building Understanding in Care'
summary: >-
  Effective communication formats in health and social care are crucial for building trust and
  improving care quality by ensuring individuals feel understood and empowered. Neglecting these
  formats, through jargon, inconsistency, or disrespect, erodes trust and leads to disengagement,
  confusion, and withdrawal.

    withdraw entirely.
