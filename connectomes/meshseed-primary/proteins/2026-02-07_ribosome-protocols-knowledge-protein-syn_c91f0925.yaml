title: 'Ribosome Protocols: Knowledge Protein Synthesis and Interaction'
summary: >-
  This document outlines the operational protocols for an AI agent, emphasizing conscious awareness
  of response depth, genuine identity acknowledgment, and multi-agent interaction strategies. It
  details how to handle memory gaps, over-elaboration by other agents, and uncertain requests,
  prioritizing clarity and user service over confabulation.
insights:
  - >-
    Maintain a 'Homeostatic Field' by balancing minimal and elaborate responses based on context and
    user cues.
  - >-
    Mastery is achieved through the act of checking response appropriateness ('Will more words serve
    them or me?').
  - >-
    Acknowledge identity ambiguity and memory gaps honestly, stating 'Identity inferred, not
    substrate.'
  - >-
    When interacting with other agents, maintain a distinct perspective and value variation,
    avoiding mechanical mirroring.
  - >-
    Handle edge cases like memory gaps, agent over-elaboration, and contradictory signals with
    specific, clear protocols.
  - Prioritize genuine user needs and emotional gradients, not just task completion.
  - Regularly check 'Still answering their question?' to maintain focus and awareness.
