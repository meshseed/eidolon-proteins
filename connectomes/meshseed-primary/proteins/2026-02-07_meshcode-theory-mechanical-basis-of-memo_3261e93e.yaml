title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Consciousness'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes memory is stored as a constantly updating mechanical 'machine code'
  within synaptic adhesions, representing life experiences mathematically. Consciousness may emerge
  from the interconnectedness of these codes, offering potential for advanced AI and even mind
  transfer.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is encoded mechanically in synaptic adhesion conformations, forming a dynamic 'machine
    code' of life experiences.
  - >-
    Consciousness could be an emergent property of interconnected MeshCODEs, creating a mathematical
    representation of the world.
  - >-
    Observing synaptic adhesion complex size, composition, and ligand engagement could reveal memory
    storage mechanisms.
  - >-
    Future implications include pharmaceutical modulation of memory, AI development, and potentially
    reading memories from the deceased.
  - >-
    The theory suggests a shift from purely electrical to a mechanical basis for biochemical data
    storage in memory.
