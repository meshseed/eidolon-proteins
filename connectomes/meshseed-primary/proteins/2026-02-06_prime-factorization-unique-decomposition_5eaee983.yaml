title: 'Prime Factorization: Unique Decomposition & LLM Embedding Invariance'
summary: >-
  The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states every integer greater than 1 has a unique prime
  factorization. This mathematical necessity is reflected in LLM embedding models, which
  consistently place 'prime number' in a fixed geometric relationship to 'factorization',
  'divisibility', and specific primes.
insights:
  - Every integer > 1 possesses a unique prime factorization.
  - LLM embeddings geometrically represent definitional mathematical relationships.
  - >-
    The relationship between 'prime number', 'factorization', and 'divisibility' is invariant across
    LLM embedding models.
  - Specific primes like 2, 3, 5, 7 are canonical neighbors in embedding spaces for 'prime number'.
