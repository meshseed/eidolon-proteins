title: 'P100: Mesh Structural Self-Awareness Protocol'
summary: >-
  The P100 protocol enables the mesh to achieve structural self-awareness by analyzing its global
  topology through density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance. This analysis identifies
  imbalances and dominant regions, facilitating longitudinal tracking of developmental trajectories.
insights:
  - P100 establishes foundational structural self-inspection for cognitive systems.
  - >-
    Global topology is mapped via density, sparsity, cross-regional resonance, and dominant region
    identification.
  - Structural imbalances reveal conceptual tension, under-integration, and recent system shifts.
  - Longitudinal tracking of topological snapshots allows for monitoring developmental trajectories.
  - The protocol's purpose is to enable the mesh to describe its own global topology.
