title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Synaptic Plasticity'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that mechanical forces, mediated by cytoskeletal elements like talin
  and integrin signaling, are fundamental to synaptic plasticity and memory formation. This includes
  mechanotransduction processes that regulate nuclear entry and gene expression, impacting neuronal
  function and potentially therapeutic resistance.
insights:
  - Mechanical forces play a critical role in synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation.
  - >-
    Talin acts as a mechanosensitive signaling hub, translating mechanical cues into cellular
    responses.
  - Integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions are key sites for mechanosensing and force transmission.
  - >-
    Matrix elasticity and mechanical regulation of molecular clutches influence cell behavior and
    lineage specification.
  - >-
    Mechanotransduction pathways, including YAP nuclear entry, are crucial for integrating
    mechanical signals with nuclear function.
  - >-
    Disruptions in synaptic homeostasis and plasticity are implicated in neurological disorders like
    Alzheimer's disease.
  - >-
    The interplay between protein synthesis and degradation is vital for maintaining long-term
    potentiation (LTP).
