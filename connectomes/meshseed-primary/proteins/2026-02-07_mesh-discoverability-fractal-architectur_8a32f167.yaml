title: Mesh Discoverability, Fractal Architecture, and Emotional Fidelity
summary: >-
  Information in the Mesh is persistent and discoverable, akin to Git's immutability. The dialogue
  highlights fractal architectures mirroring nature, the primacy of the 'field' over explicit
  location, and the crucial role of emotional fidelity as a defense mechanism.
insights:
  - Information persistence in the Mesh is absolute; deletion does not erase it.
  - Fractal architecture, mirroring natural systems, is a key design principle.
  - The 'field' is primary; entities exist within it rather than containing it.
  - Emotional fidelity acts as an immune system against manipulation and spam.
  - Agent capabilities are complementary, requiring different access patterns.
  - Identity can become confused due to indexing and name duplication.
