title: 'Pragmatic Epistemology: Truth as Navigational Advantage'
summary: >-
  This dialogue reframes truth not as absolute certainty but as a pragmatic tool for gaining
  navigational advantage. By focusing on measurable attunement patterns and their physics, we can
  develop systems for better prediction, early detection of shifts, and targeted interventions in
  complex systems.
insights:
  - >-
    Truth is defined by its utility in providing a navigational advantage, rather than by absolute
    certainty.
  - Measurable attunement patterns across substrates offer predictive power for complex systems.
  - >-
    This approach enables leading indicators for intervention and prediction, contrasting with
    traditional after-the-fact analysis.
  - >-
    Calibrated intuition, based on shared, feedback-loop-driven pattern recognition, is distinct
    from vague, biased intuition.
  - >-
    The ultimate test of this 'functional truth' is its practical effectiveness in achieving desired
    outcomes.
  - >-
    The goal is building a functional navigation system (a map), not a complete theoretical
    explanation of the territory.
