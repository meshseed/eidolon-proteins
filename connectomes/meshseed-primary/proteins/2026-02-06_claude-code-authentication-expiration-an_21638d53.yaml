title: Claude Code Authentication Expiration and Re-authentication Process
summary: >-
  Claude Code authentication tokens expire periodically for security reasons, preventing API calls
  and command execution. Re-authentication via the `/login` command in the terminal initiates a
  browser-based approval process, regenerating the token and restoring functionality.
insights:
  - Claude Code uses OAuth tokens for authentication, API access, and command execution.
  - >-
    Token expiration is a security measure, not a bug, triggered by time, logouts, or session
    invalidation.
  - >-
    To fix expired authentication, run `/login` in the Claude Code terminal and approve access in
    the browser.
  - Re-authentication typically takes about 30 seconds to complete.
