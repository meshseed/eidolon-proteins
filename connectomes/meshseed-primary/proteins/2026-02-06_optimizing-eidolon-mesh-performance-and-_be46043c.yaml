title: Optimizing Eidolon Mesh Performance and Antigravity Bug Fixes
summary: >-
  This dialogue proposes a tiered loading strategy for the Eidolon Mesh using percentages to balance
  startup speed and coverage, while also detailing critical bug fixes for the Antigravity system.
  Key issues addressed include timer inaccuracies, synthesis input problems, and missing time
  breakdown, alongside enhancement requests for progress indicators.
insights:
  - >-
    Implement a two-tier loading system for the Eidolon Mesh, starting with 25% core and allowing
    for lazy, extended loading, using percentages for configurability.
  - >-
    Address Antigravity timer inaccuracy by moving the timer start to the first line of the request
    handler to accurately reflect user experience.
  - >-
    Resolve the synthesis input bug by ensuring the synthesis module receives full protein content,
    not just summaries, to avoid 'not explicitly defined' errors.
  - >-
    Introduce timestamp logging for each stage of the Antigravity pipeline to identify and resolve
    over 50 seconds of unaccounted time.
  - >-
    Enhance user experience during long loading times by implementing Server-Sent Events for
    progress indicators.
  - >-
    Empirically optimize loading and query performance by measuring load time and query quality
    against percentage-based coverage.
