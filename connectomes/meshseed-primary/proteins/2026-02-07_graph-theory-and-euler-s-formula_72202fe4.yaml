title: Graph Theory and Euler's Formula
summary: |
  A graph is a set of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. Graph theory studies
  relationships, connectivity, and structure in networks.

  Graph types:
  - Undirected: edges have no direction (friendship networks)
  - Directed: edges have direction (web hyperlinks)
  - Weighted: edges have numerical values (road distances)
  - Complete: every vertex connected to every other

  Important properties:
  - Connectivity: path exists between any two vertices
  - Cycles: path that returns to starting vertex
  - Planarity: can be drawn without edge crossings
  - Euler's formula for planar graphs: V - E + F = 2

  Classic problems:
  - Seven Bridges of Königsberg: birth of graph theory (Euler, 1736)
  - Four Color Theorem: any planar map needs only 4 colors
  - Traveling Salesman: shortest route visiting all vertices (NP-hard)
insights:
  - Relationships create structure
  - Connectivity patterns reveal system properties
  - Network topology determines information flow
  - Parts gain meaning through connections to whole
  - V - E + F = 2 is topologically invariant
