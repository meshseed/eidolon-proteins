title: Mobile Graph UI Broken Post-Gemini Update; Layout Fix Deployed
summary: >-
  A recent Gemini update to the 'golden connectome' broke the mobile graph visualization, causing
  nodes to not display. A 'safe height' CSS fix was deployed to address potential layout overlaps,
  which was successful in restoring visibility on mobile devices.
insights:
  - >-
    The Gemini update introduced a bug affecting mobile graph node rendering, while desktop remained
    unaffected.
  - >-
    A CSS adjustment to `.viz-canvas` was implemented to ensure a 'safe height', preventing content
    overlap on mobile.
  - >-
    The deployed 'safe height' fix successfully restored the visibility of graph nodes on mobile
    devices.
  - If the graph remains blank post-fix, the issue is likely data/rendering related, not layout.
  - Reverting to a previous build was considered as an alternative to direct repair.
