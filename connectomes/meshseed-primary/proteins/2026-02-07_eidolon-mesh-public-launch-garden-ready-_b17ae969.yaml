title: 'Eidolon Mesh Public Launch: Garden Ready, Node.js Runtime Confirmed'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh has completed Phase 17, opening the 'Garden' for public access with rewritten
  documentation and stable v1.1 codebase. The project is a standalone Node.js application, requiring
  only standard npm commands for setup and execution, not the 'Antigravity' development environment.

    Running the Eidolon Mesh project requires only standard Node.js (v16+) and npm commands: `npm
    install`, `npm run build`, and `npm run dashboard`.

    dependency for the project itself.
  - >-
    The project is designed to be completely standalone and easily runnable by anyone who clones the
    repository, simplifying public usability.
