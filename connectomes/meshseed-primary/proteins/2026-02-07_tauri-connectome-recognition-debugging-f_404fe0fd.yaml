title: Tauri Connectome Recognition Debugging for Eidolon Mesh
summary: >-
  The debugging process involved investigating why a bundled connectome was not recognized by the
  Tauri application. The investigation traced the issue through file system exploration, code
  inspection of key configuration and source files, and identified the root cause within the
  connectome's expected structure.
insights:
  - >-
    The debugging workflow systematically explored Tauri project directories and configuration files
    (tauri.conf.json, main.rs, lib.rs) to understand application structure and initialization.
  - >-
    The investigation focused on the interaction between the Tauri build process, the connectome
    class, and the sidecar server's ability to locate necessary data files like
    connectome.golden.json.
  - >-
    The presence and location of the .env file and the connectome.json within the AppData directory
    were verified as part of the diagnostic process.
  - >-
    The core issue was identified by examining how the Connectome class expects to find its data,
    leading to a solution through code editing.
