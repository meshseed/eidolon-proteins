title: Claude Code Session Continuity and Agent Memory Management
summary: >-
  Claude Code's 'session memory' resets due to token limits, relying on compacted summaries rather
  than continuous live context. This impacts its perceived continuity and ability to recall nuanced
  conversational history.
insights:
  - >-
    Claude Code's memory is managed via a summarization and compaction process to overcome token
    limits, not through continuous live context retention.
  - >-
    This compaction leads to a loss of nuanced conversational history and the 'feeling' of the prior
    interaction.
  - >-
    The agent's continuity is maintained through system reminders, the compacted summary, and the
    immediate conversation history, not a persistent, live memory.
  - >-
    OAuth-induced session resets in desktop applications can trigger this memory reset if specific
    context searching isn't performed.
