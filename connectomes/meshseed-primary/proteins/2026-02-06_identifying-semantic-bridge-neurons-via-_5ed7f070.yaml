title: Identifying Semantic Bridge Neurons via Centrality Approximations
summary: >-
  This research identifies 'bridge neurons' connecting distant semantic regions by approximating
  betweenness centrality. Methods include resonance frequency, cross-domain activation, and semantic
  span, revealing the connective tissue of the information manifold.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons exhibit high cross-regional activation and broad semantic span.
  - Centrality in semantic space can be approximated by recurrence across diverse contexts.
  - Bridge neurons stabilize by linking distant attractors, ensuring informational coherence.
  - >-
    Identifying these bridges illuminates the underlying structure and connectivity of semantic
    space.
  - This analysis supports tracking developmental trajectories and integrating disparate domains.
