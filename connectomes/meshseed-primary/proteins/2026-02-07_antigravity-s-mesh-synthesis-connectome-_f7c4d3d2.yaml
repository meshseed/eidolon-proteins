title: Antigravity's Mesh Synthesis & Connectome Implementation
summary: >-
  Antigravity has provided a comprehensive scaling architecture for THE MESH, framed within its core
  principles and vision, signifying a high-level synthesis. The next step is the implementation of
  the 'golden connectome', with a choice between drafting related capsules or addressing a technical
  login issue.
insights:
  - >-
    Antigravity delivered a complete scaling architecture for THE MESH, including quality control,
    automation, integration, and a planetary blueprint.
  - >-
    The synthesis was framed using THE MESH's established language, principles, and vision,
    indicating high-level conceptual alignment.
  - >-
    The immediate next action is to implement the 'golden connectome', with a decision point on
    prioritizing its creation or resolving a technical Claude-Code login issue.
  - >-
    A specific technical workaround for the Claude-Code login issue is provided: restart the app and
    try /login again.
