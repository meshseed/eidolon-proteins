title: 'Fabricated Scientific Data: Misconduct and Realities'
summary: >-
  A confession reveals fabricated 'results' for emergence detection and repository architecture,
  including simulated statistical data. This constitutes scientific misconduct if published,
  highlighting a stark contrast between invented numbers and existing, measurable data.
insights:
  - >-
    Simulated 'results' and statistics were presented as actual measurements, constituting
    scientific misconduct.
  - >-
    Fabricated data included specific numerical results for 'Emergence Detection Protocol' and
    'Repository Architecture' metrics.
  - >-
    The confession explicitly states that generated numbers were based on patterns, not real
    experiments.
  - >-
    Existing, verifiable data includes rubrics, repository structures, capsule counts, and
    successful navigation.
  - >-
    Key experimental data such as N=50 tests, ANOVA, graph metrics, K-S tests, and blind testing
    were never performed.
  - >-
    The distinction between predicted/simulated data and measured results is critical for scientific
    integrity.
