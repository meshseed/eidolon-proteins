title: 'Fractals: Self-Similarity, Infinite Detail, Fractional Dimensions'
summary: >-
  Fractals are shapes exhibiting scale invariance, where zoomed-in sections mirror the whole,
  leading to infinite detail and complexity.  This phenomenon arises from simple recursive rules,
  resulting in fractional dimensions and patterns found in both mathematics and nature.
insights:
  - Fractals are characterized by self-similarity across all scales.
  - Infinite detail emerges from simple, iterative generative rules.
  - Fractals possess fractional dimensions, deviating from Euclidean geometry.
  - The complexity of fractals is a result of recursive self-reference.
  - Natural phenomena like coastlines and branching systems display fractal properties.
