title: 'MESH: Physics, Coherence, and Retry System Enhancements'
summary: >-
  This update to THE MESH introduces a Physics Modulation System for dynamic visualization and
  communication, a Coherence Normalization phase to fix clustering issues and improve distribution
  mapping, and a robust Retry System for enhanced LLM interaction stability.
insights:
  - >-
    Physics Modulation System uses graph 'body language' and emotional tone presets for AI
    communication and visualization.
  - >-
    Coherence Normalization addresses the 0.98-1.0 clustering problem by employing percentile-based
    mapping and offering dry-run previews.
  - >-
    A new Retry System with exponential backoff and jitter is integrated to handle API overload and
    rate limits, improving LLM reliability.
  - >-
    Dual-layer control (involuntary + voluntary) is implemented for the Physics Modulation System,
    suggesting sophisticated interaction.
  - >-
    Node coloring by tier and activation state provides visual cues for understanding data hierarchy
    and activity within THE MESH.
