title: MeshWorkspace Structure Review and Simplification
summary: >-
  A review of the MeshWorkspace structure identified duplicated categories (MeshCapsules, Ledgers)
  and unclear access logic for public/private content. Recommendations focus on consolidating
  duplicates, flattening over-engineered nesting, and clarifying public/private criteria to align
  with the Mesh's building block ethos.
insights:
  - >-
    Duplicated root-level and nested categories (e.g., MeshCapsules, Ledgers) create organizational
    ambiguity.
  - >-
    The distinction between public (MeshCapsules) and private (SovereignVault) content requires
    clearer definition and structural representation.
  - Over-nested empty folders suggest a tendency towards over-engineering, which can be simplified.
  - >-
    Consolidating duplicate categories and establishing clear placement rules is crucial for
    consistency.
  - >-
    Flattening the structure where possible and adding complexity only as content emerges aligns
    with the Mesh's foundational principles.
