title: 'MESH Architecture: Golgi Apparatus for Transport and Identity'
summary: >-
  The MESH requires a 'Golgi Apparatus' for transport and routing, addressing a previously
  identified blind spot. This involves establishing identity and boundaries through signal peptide
  tagging, prioritizing differentiation before coordination for growth.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Golgi Apparatus' is identified as the crucial component for implementing transport and
    routing within THE MESH.
  - >-
    Signal peptide tagging (#public, #private, #mixed) is proposed to define identity and boundaries
    for different data streams.
  - >-
    The development strategy prioritizes differentiation before coordination to ensure controlled
    and effective growth.
  - >-
    Establishing identity and boundaries is a prerequisite for subsequent growth and expansion of
    THE MESH.
  - >-
    The dialogue highlights a clear recognition of a missed element (transport) and a precise
    solution (Golgi).
