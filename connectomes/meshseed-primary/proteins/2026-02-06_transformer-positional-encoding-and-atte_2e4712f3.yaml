title: Transformer Positional Encoding and Attention Efficiency
summary: >-
  The Transformer model injects positional information using sine and cosine functions to enable
  sequence order awareness without recurrence or convolution. Self-attention layers offer
  computational advantages over recurrent layers by reducing sequential operations and path lengths
  for learning long-range dependencies.
insights:
  - >-
    Positional encodings (sine/cosine functions) are added to input embeddings to provide sequence
    order information in non-recurrent/convolutional models.
  - >-
    The chosen sine/cosine positional encoding allows for easy learning of relative positioning due
    to linear function representation.
  - >-
    Self-attention layers have constant computational complexity per layer and allow for high
    parallelization, unlike recurrent layers.
  - >-
    Shorter path lengths between input and output positions in self-attention networks facilitate
    learning long-range dependencies.
  - >-
    Shared weight matrices between embedding layers and pre-softmax linear transformation are used,
    scaled by √dmodel.
