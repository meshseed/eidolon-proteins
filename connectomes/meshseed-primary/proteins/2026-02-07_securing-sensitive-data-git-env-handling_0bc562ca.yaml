title: 'Securing Sensitive Data: Git .env Handling and API Key Management'
summary: >-
  This dialogue focuses on securing sensitive information, particularly API keys stored in a .env
  file, within a Git repository. It outlines steps to prevent accidental commits, revoke compromised
  keys, and verify the repository's safety before public sharing.
insights:
  - Sensitive information like API keys should never be committed to a Git repository.
  - A .gitignore file is crucial for excluding sensitive files such as .env from tracking.
  - >-
    If a .env file is accidentally committed and pushed, immediately revoke associated API keys and
    generate new ones.
  - Regularly use `git status` and `git ls-files | findstr .env` to verify that .env is not tracked.
  - >-
    Confirming the absence of .env tracking and the correct configuration of .gitignore is essential
    before publishing code.
