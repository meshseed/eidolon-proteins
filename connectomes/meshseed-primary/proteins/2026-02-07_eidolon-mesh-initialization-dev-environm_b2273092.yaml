title: Eidolon Mesh Initialization & Dev Environment Setup
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh system initializes its local Gemma provider and Connectome, clearing caches and
  loading historical exchanges. It then initiates a development command to run the Tauri
  application, indicating the setup of the local development environment for UI glitch debugging.
insights:
  - The system utilizes a local Gemma provider via a Flask API for its Connectome.
  - Top neurons by coherence score are prioritized for query strategy.
  - The development environment is set up to watch for changes in the Tauri source code.
  - The application is launched using a bundled Node.js runtime after compilation.
  - Caching mechanisms for embeddings and proteins are cleared for a fresh development cycle.
