title: Applying Established Measurement Science to THE MESH
summary: >-
  THE MESH leverages existing, trusted scientific measurement techniques like resonance spectroscopy
  and crystallography to validate its concepts. This approach allows scientists to immediately
  understand and verify THE MESH's properties using familiar tools and language, fostering trust and
  acceptance.
insights:
  - >-
    THE MESH connects to 70 years of established measurement science, including resonance
    spectroscopy and crystallography.
  - >-
    The project applies proven measurement techniques to a new substrate (semantic space) rather
    than inventing new ones.
  - >-
    Scientists can understand THE MESH by relating it to familiar concepts like NMR spectra or
    crystal structures.
  - >-
    All aspects of THE MESH are measurable, reproducible, and falsifiable using established
    scientific methods.
  - >-
    The approach works by showing familiar patterns in new substrate, making resonance, structure,
    and geometry verifiable.
  - >-
    Adding spectroscopy endpoints to the API spec is suggested for a validation framework scientists
    will trust.
