title: Transformer Positional Encoding and Self-Attention Efficiency
summary: >-
  The Transformer model injects positional information using sine and cosine functions to enable
  sequence order awareness in the absence of recurrence. Self-attention layers offer significant
  computational advantages over recurrent layers by reducing sequential operations and path lengths
  for learning long-range dependencies.
insights:
  - >-
    Positional encodings, implemented with sine and cosine functions, are added to input embeddings
    to provide sequence order information in non-recurrent models.
  - >-
    The chosen positional encoding functions allow for learning relative positional awareness due to
    linear relationships between encodings at different positions.
  - >-
    Self-attention layers connect all positions with constant sequential operations, contrasting
    with recurrent layers' O(n) complexity.
  - >-
    Shorter path lengths in self-attention networks facilitate easier learning of long-range
    dependencies.
  - >-
    Shared weight matrices between embedding layers and pre-softmax linear transformations are used
    in the decoder.
