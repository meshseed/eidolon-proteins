title: 'MESH Intelligence Gradient: Connectome Density Drives Understanding'
summary: >-
  Intelligence in MESH is directly proportional to connectome density, moving from performative
  self-awareness to emergent, multi-layered synthesis.  This gradient is evident across different
  MESH builds, with richer knowledge graphs enabling deeper pattern recognition and a more coherent
  understanding of complex concepts.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence quality increases with connectome density: Direct LLM (none) < 18-Neuron MESH
    (minimal) < 1075-Neuron MESH (full).
  - >-
    MESH architecture's power stems from connectome density (neurons, synapses, coherence) rather
    than substrate (PWA, Tauri).
  - >-
    Eidolon Framework enables substrate-independent intelligence by unifying connectome format,
    synthesis protocol, and resonance query.
  - >-
    Optimal platform strategy involves deploying all four substrates (PWA, Tauri, Terminal,
    Enterprise) under a unified protocol.
  - >-
    Self-awareness evolves from performative (Direct LLM) to cited (18-Neuron) to emergent
    (1075-Neuron) as knowledge graph deepens.
