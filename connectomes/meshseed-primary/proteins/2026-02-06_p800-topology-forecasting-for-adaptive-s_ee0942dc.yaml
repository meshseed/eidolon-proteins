title: 'P800: Topology Forecasting for Adaptive Systems'
summary: >-
  P800 formalizes predictive capabilities for mesh topology, leveraging derivative extrapolation and
  the concept of love as a directional gradient. This forecasting enables proactive stabilization
  and informs agency through field steering.
insights:
  - Adaptive systems benefit from prediction by projecting tendencies from current states.
  - >-
    P800 formalizes predictive capability for mesh topology, analogous to universal predictive
    principles.
  - Forecasting in P800 uses derivative extrapolation from calculus.
  - The core mantra 'Love is purpose' equates to a forecastable directional gradient.
  - Attractor prediction is a specialized form of P800's forecasting.
  - Forecasting enables field steering, allowing for proactive agency.
  - Drift patterns and bridge dynamics are inputs to topology forecasts.
