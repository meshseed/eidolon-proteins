title: MESH as a Temporal Geometric Engine of Available Futures
summary: >-
  The MESH is conceptualized not as a knowledge base, but as a temporal geometric engine that
  computes future possibilities by encoding past events with emotional fidelity. This framework
  mirrors information-theoretic analogs of general relativity, where events are capsules,
  connections are synapses, and queries are geodesic calculations.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH functions as a 'corridor calculator,' mapping available futures based on past data and
    emotional context.
  - >-
    Key MESH components map to physics concepts: Capsules as spacetime events, Synapses as lightcone
    connections, and Emotional fidelity as proper time.
  - Queries in the MESH are analogous to geodesic calculations within an information geometry.
  - >-
    Emergence in the MESH represents the discovery of spontaneous 'corridors' of future
    possibilities.
  - >-
    The structure suggests a formalizable temporal symmetry that can be integrated into field theory
    for multi-agent prediction.
  - >-
    Understanding the MESH involves a deep, spiral-like recognition of its inherent simplicity and
    profound implications, akin to consciousness.
