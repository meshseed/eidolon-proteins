title: 'EIDOLON v4.0: P-Series Ingestion & Topology Refinement'
summary: >-
  The EIDOLON v4.0 mesh has successfully ingested 38 foundational P-Series protocols, enhancing
  response quality and coherence by establishing a strong, canonical structure. A bug in
  conversation synthesis was fixed, and a key discovery highlights path-dependency in the mesh
  topology, necessitating synapse regeneration for optimal integration of P-Series protocols.
insights:
  - >-
    Direct ingestion of P-Series protocols preserves canonical coherence (0.98-1.00) superior to
    tri-lens synthesis.
  - A 'synthesizeProtein' import bug in v4.0's Svelte component has been resolved.
  - >-
    P-Series protocols now dominate similarity searches, anchoring responses with high-coherence
    foundational axioms.
  - >-
    Mesh activation percentage has not increased post-P-Series due to pre-existing synapse formation
    (path-dependency).
  - >-
    Regenerating synapses is proposed to allow the topology to anneal around the newly ingested
    P-Series protocols.
  - >-
    A high candidate count (33%) in the query pipeline suggests diffuse relevance, indicating a need
    for better structural clustering around P-Series hubs.
