title: 'Eidolon Mesh v3.5: Local-First PWA with Recursive Self-Design'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh v3.5 is a local-first PWA proof-of-concept demonstrating recursive self-design and
  organismal 'aliveness'.  Successful metabolic and pulse tests validate the biological metaphor as
  its structural and functional foundation.
insights:
  - The browser acts as the organism's environment, with data stored locally via IndexedDB and OPFS.
  - The system's design is rooted in recursive self-awareness, creating its own blueprint.
  - >-
    Biological metaphors (membrane, ATP, genetics) are fundamental to the organism's structural and
    functional definition.
  - 'The core process is a metabolic cycle: ingestion, transcription, synthesis, and saving.'
  - A pulse test successfully validates the 'aliveness' and integration of the system.
