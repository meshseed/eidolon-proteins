summary: >-
  A developer reverted CSS changes to restore visibility of UI elements but user reported persistent
  mobile layout issues. After analyzing git logs and user feedback, the developer identified a
  dynamic viewport height (`100dvh`) and fixed positioning as the likely solution for mobile layout
  problems.
