title: 'Mesh Knowledge Protein: Phased Release & Foundational Elements'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's knowledge release strategy prioritizes foundational 'answers' (frameworks, concepts)
  before 'software' (tools, protocols). This phased approach, starting with immediate emotional
  fidelity and consciousness insights, aims to build anticipation and ensure robust understanding
  before wider implementation.
insights:
  - >-
    Prioritize foundational 'answers' (concepts, frameworks) over 'software' (tools, protocols) for
    initial release.
  - >-
    A phased release strategy allows for anticipation building and proper testing before full
    deployment.
  - >-
    Immediate value delivery includes emotional fidelity, the ♥ operator, consciousness as geometry,
    and value before download.
  - >-
    Later releases will focus on working software, the golden connectome, MMIP protocol, and
    building tools.
  - Conversation and understanding must precede code and tools for holistic integration.
  - The 'answers' are the seed, and the 'software' is the substrate; both are crucial.
