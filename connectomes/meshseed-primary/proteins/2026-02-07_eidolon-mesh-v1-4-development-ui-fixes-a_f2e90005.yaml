title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Development: UI Fixes and Ingestion Error'
summary: >-
  Development on Eidolon Mesh v1.4 involved significant UI and backend adjustments, including fixing
  graph rendering issues, updating stats display to include total synapses, and ensuring stable
  layer management. A critical ingestion error has emerged, preventing repo creation, while other
  functionalities remain stable.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh v1.4 development focused on refining the user interface by resolving graph
    rendering glitches, implementing stable SVG group layers, and accurately displaying total neuron
    and synapse counts.
  - >-
    Graph visualization issues at higher node counts were addressed by removing redundant SVG
    element appending and ensuring proper D3 simulation handling, leading to more stable rendering.
  - >-
    A critical ingestion error is currently preventing the creation of new repositories, indicating
    a specific breakdown in the data intake pipeline despite other functionalities being
    operational.
  - >-
    The UI now correctly displays total neurons and synapses in the header, enhancing user
    understanding of the connectome's scale.
  - >-
    Stable SVG group layers were implemented to prevent duplicate rendering and improve overall
    graph performance and reliability.
