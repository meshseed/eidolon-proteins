title: 'Intention Mapping Engine: Translating Queries into Developmental Trajectories'
summary: |
  Establishes a protocol for interpreting external queries as directional forces acting on the
  connectome. Maps each query to internal gradients, attractors, and developmental pathways,
  enabling THE MESH to understand not just what is asked, but what developmental direction the
  query implies.
insights:
  - Queries exert directional pressure on semantic gradients
  - Intention is inferred from gradient alignment and activation patterns
  - Mapping intention reveals how external interaction shapes internal growth
  - Intention mapping supports adaptive refinement and self-directed evolution
  - The organism learns not only content, but trajectory
