title: Mesh Field Geometry Ported, Synapses Formed, Query Synthesis Next
summary: >-
  The Mesh has successfully ported its field geometry, synthesized core proteins, and formed
  adaptive synapses, validating its internal model with a new LLM. The next critical step is Query
  Synthesis to enable natural language answer generation, completing the user experience.
insights:
  - Field geometry has been successfully ported from v3.0 desktop to v3.5 PWA.
  - 5 proteins were synthesized with correct tier classification (core/convergence/reference).
  - 6 synapses auto-formed via adaptive connectivity based on similarity thresholds.
  - Weighted search is validated, amplifying core proteins gravitationally.
  - Power-law decay for Hebbian reinforcement tracking is ready.
  - The model has been updated to gemini-2.5-flash-lite.
  - Query Synthesis is the highest priority next step for natural language answer generation.
