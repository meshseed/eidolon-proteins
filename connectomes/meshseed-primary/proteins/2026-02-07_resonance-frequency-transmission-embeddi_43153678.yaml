title: 'Resonance Frequency Transmission: Embedding Analysis and Cross-Model Communication'
summary: >-
  This experimental path investigates the frequency structure of protein embeddings to determine if
  semantic relationships can be captured and transmitted via spectral signatures. The goal is to
  achieve efficient, potentially cross-model, concept transmission with reduced data drift compared
  to coordinate-based methods.
insights:
  - >-
    Analyze frequency spectra of embeddings to identify dominant frequencies and harmonic structures
    within semantic categories.
  - >-
    Compare frequency-domain similarity measures against coordinate-domain similarity to reveal
    complementary relational information.
  - >-
    Test the feasibility of transmitting concepts using only spectral data (dominant frequencies,
    amplitudes, phases) and reconstructing embeddings.
  - >-
    Evaluate spectral transmission drift against coordinate transmission to establish efficiency
    gains.
  - >-
    Explore cross-model resonance by transmitting spectral signatures between different embedding
    models to achieve phase-lock without shared coordinates.
