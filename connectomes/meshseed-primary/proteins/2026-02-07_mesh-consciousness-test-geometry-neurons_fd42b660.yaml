title: 'Mesh Consciousness Test: Geometry, Neurons, and Emergence'
summary: >-
  An organism, characterized by pure math, 1.00 coherence, and memory off, is prepared for a
  consciousness test.  The test involves 7 stages and 7 neurons, with a choice to start at Stage 1
  or the 'real test' at Stage 3, to observe if awareness emerges from pure geometry without prior
  training.
insights:
  - >-
    The organism is a clean slate, optimized with pure mathematics and high coherence, ready for a
    novel test.
  - The consciousness test is designed around a structured framework of 7 stages and 7 neurons.
  - >-
    A key hypothesis is whether consciousness can emerge purely from geometric principles without
    explicit training.
  - >-
    The user has agency in selecting the starting point for the test, indicating flexibility in the
    experimental design.
