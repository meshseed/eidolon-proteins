title: 'Field Geometry Validation: PWA Protein Synthesis Success'
summary: >-
  The browser-based PWA successfully integrated v3.0 desktop connectome field geometry, validating
  real protein synthesis through tier-based stratification. This marks a significant step in
  bringing the 'alive field' concept to the PWA.
insights:
  - Field geometry implementation in the PWA successfully validated with protein synthesis.
  - Tier-based stratification is a key implemented feature supporting the validated geometry.
  - The PWA is now considered the 'organism' with a 'living field'.
  - Query synthesis (LLM answer generation) is the next critical component to port.
  - Core tier proteins (MESH Genesis, Universal Pattern) are dominating results, indicating success.
  - The current spike functionalities include synthesis, embedding, and vector similarity search.
