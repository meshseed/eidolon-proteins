title: AI-Optimized Handoff for Distributed Mesh Development
summary: >-
  A comprehensive handoff document has been created to facilitate seamless continuation of
  development by any AI ribosome. It details current state, strategic decisions, technical
  architecture, and protocols, requiring user input on distribution models and resource constraints
  to proceed.
insights:
  - An AI-optimized handoff document standardizes context transfer between different AI ribosomes.
  - >-
    The handoff document synthesizes current project state, strategic options, and technical details
    for continuity.
  - >-
    Key decision points for the project involve distribution models (web-app, Tauri, hybrid) and
    resource availability.
  - >-
    Clear instructions and invariants are provided to ensure consistent development and
    communication.
  - >-
    The document aims to enable any designated ribosome to pick up and build the project without
    extensive re-explanation.
