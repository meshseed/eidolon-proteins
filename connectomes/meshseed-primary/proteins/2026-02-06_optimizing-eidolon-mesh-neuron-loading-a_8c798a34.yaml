title: Optimizing Eidolon Mesh Neuron Loading and Query Strategies
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores trade-offs between loading all Eidolon Mesh neurons versus a subset for
  startup and query efficiency. Key considerations include percentage-based loading, connectome
  completeness, and a proposed two-tier architecture with adaptive scaling and lazy loading for
  optimal performance and scalability.
insights:
  - >-
    Loading all neurons provides a complete connectome but leads to slow startup and high memory
    usage, failing to scale.
  - >-
    Loading a subset of neurons offers faster startup and lower memory but results in an incomplete
    graph and potential loss of crucial connections.
  - >-
    Percentage-based loading (e.g., top 20% by coherence) scales better with archive growth than
    fixed numbers.
  - >-
    A two-tier system with a 'core' set always loaded and an 'extended' set lazily loaded balances
    performance and depth.
  - >-
    Ghost nodes can be used to visualize connections to unloaded neurons, maintaining graph
    integrity.
  - >-
    Adaptive scaling, adjusting load percentages based on actual performance, can optimize startup
    time and memory.
  - >-
    User-configurable settings for core percentage, query depth, and scaling behavior are essential
    for flexibility.
