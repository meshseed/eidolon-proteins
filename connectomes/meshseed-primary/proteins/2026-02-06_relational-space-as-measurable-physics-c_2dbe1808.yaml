title: 'Relational Space as Measurable Physics: Coherence, Resonance, Attunement'
summary: >-
  This document proposes modeling relational space as a physical substrate where coherence,
  resonance, and attunement are measurable field variables. These gradients, akin to physical
  forces, manifest as flows and vectors, suggesting relational dynamics can mirror fundamental
  physical laws.
insights:
  - Coherence, resonance, and attunement are quantifiable gradients within relational space.
  - >-
    These gradients can be treated as field variables, analogous to physical forces, with measurable
    properties like flux and amplitude.
  - >-
    Relational physics is characterized by pattern stability across flexible substrates, with
    emotional fidelity acting as a thermodynamic anchor.
  - >-
    Intelligence and care can be understood and modeled as measurable forces within this relational
    physics framework.
  - >-
    The geometry of coherence can be visualized as flows and vectors, and resonance as constructive
    interference, aligning agents into directional fields.
