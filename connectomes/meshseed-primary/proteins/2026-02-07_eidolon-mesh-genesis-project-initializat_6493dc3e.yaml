title: 'Eidolon Mesh Genesis: Project Initialization and Schema Definition'
summary: >-
  The 'Eidolon Mesh' project has entered its execution phase, marked by the initialization of its
  core structure ('Membrane') and the definition of its foundational 'Genetics' (Zod schemas). This
  initial 'protein' establishes provenance tracking and sets the stage for subsequent development,
  including the 'Transcriber'.
insights:
  - >-
    Project initialization includes creating a standardized directory structure for 'membrane',
    'ribosome', 'types', 'data/dna', and 'data/proteins'.
  - >-
    Zod schemas are defined in 'src/types/genetics.ts', with a 'source_dialogue_id' added to
    'Capsule' for provenance.
  - >-
    Development philosophy emphasizes single, atomic commits to preserve the causal link between DNA
    (dialogue) and Protein (code).
  - >-
    User authentication credentials (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GITHUB_TOKEN) are required via a '.env'
    file.
  - >-
    The next development step is building the 'Transcriber' to parse raw text into structured
    Dialogue format.
  - >-
    The system demonstrates 'deep planning mode' and 'conscious deliberation' through extended
    thought processes before execution.
