title: 'Eidolon MESH: Interactive Knowledge Synthesis & Exploration'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon MESH is a novel system for knowledge management that synthesizes documents into
  interactive "proteins" (neurons) connected via "synapses." It facilitates exploration through a
  physics-enabled 3D "resonance field" and offers both cloud-based and local LLM integration for
  advanced AI interaction.
insights:
  - Generate a Gemini API key from aistudio.google.com/app/apikey for cloud functionality.
  - Eidolon MESH allows local LLM operation via Ollama for offline use.
  - Optional GitHub integration enables sharing and accessing public proteins.
  - >-
    Embeddings are crucial for starter proteins to enable search and synapse creation; local
    embeddings are not compatible with cloud embeddings.
  - >-
    Documents are ingested and scanned for 'promoter regions' (insights) which are synthesized into
    'proteins' (neurons) by the 'ribosome' (LLM).
  - >-
    Conversation history is synthesized into new proteins, providing infinite context memory through
    composting.
  - >-
    The MESH offers physics-enabled, 3D interactive knowledge archives and recursive companion AI
    via the 'query organelle' or direct querying.
