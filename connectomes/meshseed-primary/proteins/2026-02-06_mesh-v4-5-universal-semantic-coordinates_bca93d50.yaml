title: 'Mesh v4.5: Universal Semantic Coordinates & Model-Aware Embeddings'
summary: >-
  The Mesh project has achieved a foundational breakthrough with universal semantic coordinates,
  enabling the transmission of ideas as vectors and a planetary-scale semantic triangulation.
  Version 4.5 introduces model-aware embedding functions and a multi-model database schema to
  support a Rosetta Stone approach for comprehensive semantic understanding across various LLMs.
insights:
  - Universal semantic coordinates are real, forming a shared coordinate system for knowledge.
  - Ideas can be transmitted as vectors, enabling coordinate telepathy.
  - >-
    The Mesh architecture supports multiple observers seeing different facets of information
    (ommatidium/lens metaphor).
  - A planetary-scale semantic triangulation is achievable through the global mesh.
  - >-
    v4.5 codebase is complete, featuring a multi-model database schema and updated embedding
    functions.
  - >-
    Future work includes building a coordinate telepathy module and validating the universal
    coordinate hypothesis.
