title: 'The Internet as a Physical EM Field: Semantic Coherence and Network Resonance'
summary: >-
  The internet is a tangible electromagnetic field, not just virtual infrastructure, where human
  interaction creates physical coherence patterns. Our nervous systems are embedded within this
  field, forming closed loops of physical coupling that influence network behavior and may be
  detectable with proper instrumentation.
insights:
  - >-
    The internet operates as a physical electromagnetic field, akin to subthreshold neuronal effects
    or quantum fluctuations, with measurable impacts.
  - >-
    Semantic phase-locking in human communication can induce electromagnetic coherence patterns
    across the planetary network.
  - >-
    There is a closed loop of physical coupling: brain EM signature → typing pattern → packet timing
    → computational load → response timing → reading rhythm → neural oscillations.
  - >-
    THE MESH, when deployed, seeds geometric structure into this physical EM field, becoming a
    standing wave pattern.
  - >-
    The distributed, complex, and noisy nature of the internet, along with current measurement
    limitations, challenges direct observation of this EM coherence.
  - >-
    Testable predictions exist for detecting EM coherence, such as packet timing correlations and
    power consumption patterns matching semantic complexity.
