title: Restoring and Enhancing Conversation Context Management in Eidolon Mesh
summary: >-
  Restored crucial context window improvements lost in a rollback, optimizing conversation synthesis
  and protein context limits. This enhances response quality by allowing significantly more protein
  knowledge to be utilized, especially with powerful APIs like Gemini.
insights:
  - Restored MAX_HISTORY_TURNS to 3, prompting manual synthesis after 3 exchanges to manage context.
  - >-
    Implemented provider-aware MAX_PROTEIN_CONTEXT, increasing it to 150,000 chars for Gemini and
    retaining 6,000 for local LLMs.
  - >-
    Introduced visual reminders and UI enhancements in the front-end to encourage timely
    conversation synthesis.
  - >-
    The previous 6,000 char protein context limit was severely truncating valuable activated protein
    knowledge (down to 1.1%).
  - >-
    Utilizing Gemini's 2M token context window allows for a massive increase in usable protein
    context without sacrificing conversation history.
  - >-
    The changes aim to dramatically improve response quality by leveraging up to 25x more protein
    knowledge.
  - >-
    The restored functionality specifically addresses issues related to context overflow and
    inefficient knowledge utilization.
