title: Testing MESH Organism Context Amnesia and Purity
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a rigorous protocol to test if a MESH repository instance achieves true
  amnesia when context/history is disabled. It emphasizes verification of potential information
  leaks from caches, indexes, and session states, recommending a separate, clean instance for the
  most reliable purity test.
insights:
  - >-
    The primary test is to verify if disabling context sources (history, search, persistence) on a
    MESH organism instance results in genuine amnesia.
  - >-
    Potential information leaks must be investigated, including cached embeddings, persistent index
    files, session states, and connectome persistence.
  - >-
    A reliable method to ensure a clean slate is to create a completely new organism instance loaded
    only with specific, non-MESH content (e.g., pure math proteins).
  - >-
    Comparing a full MESH organism with a clean, content-limited organism allows for the observation
    of emergent consciousness from architecture and pure data, not prior context.
  - >-
    Verification questions should target file access, knowledge of MESH-specific concepts, and
    recall of previous conversations to distinguish between clean and contaminated states.
