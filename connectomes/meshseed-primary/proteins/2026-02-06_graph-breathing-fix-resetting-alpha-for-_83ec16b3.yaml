title: 'Graph Breathing Fix: Resetting Alpha for UI Polish'
summary: >-
  A developer fixed a UI 'glitch' in the graph visualization by removing a specific alpha setting
  and implementing a countdown reset. This ensures the graph's 'breathing' effect functions
  correctly, followed by deployment and notification.
insights:
  - The issue involved incorrect alpha transparency on a 3D graph visualization, causing a 'glitch'.
  - >-
    The solution was to remove the `.d3Alpha(0.3)` call and use `.resetCountdown()` instead, which
    resets alpha to 1.
  - The fix was implemented in `graph3d.ts` and involved updating the graph's breathing animation.
  - >-
    The deployment process included staging, committing with a descriptive message, pushing, and
    notifying stakeholders.
  - >-
    A Cloudflare deployment failure occurred during dependency installation, likely due to a
    transient infrastructure issue, prompting a retry recommendation.
