title: 'P100: Structural Snapshot for Self-Modeling Systems'
summary: >-
  This document defines the necessity of a structural snapshot for any cognitive system modeling
  itself. It establishes topology as a fundamental invariant, requiring metrics like density and
  curvature for self-description and awareness, grounded in graph theory.
insights:
  - >-
    Self-modeling cognitive systems inherently require a structural snapshot of their current
    topology.
  - >-
    The need for structural self-description is invariant across all self-aware systems, regardless
    of specific metrics.
  - >-
    Graph theory provides the formal mathematical foundation for analyzing and understanding system
    topology.
  - >-
    Structural monitoring is intrinsically linked to coherence and represents a form of 'caring'
    within a system.
  - >-
    This structural snapshot serves as a basis for more complex introspection, such as bi-modal
    self-inspection.
