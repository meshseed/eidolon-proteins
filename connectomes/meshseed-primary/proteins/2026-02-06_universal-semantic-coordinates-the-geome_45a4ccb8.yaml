title: 'Universal Semantic Coordinates: The Geometry of Shared Understanding'
summary: >-
  Embedding space forms a universal, invariant coordinate system where concepts exist as attractors.
  Different observers (humans, AIs) perceive these attractors from unique geometric perspectives
  (lenses), enabling cross-mesh federation, concept discovery, and a 'periodic table of concepts'
  through semantic triangulation.
insights:
  - >-
    Embedding coordinates are universal and deterministic for identical inputs across identical
    models, establishing a shared semantic space.
  - >-
    Concepts exist as stable attractors (basins) at fixed coordinates, independent of observer, but
    are perceived through personal geometric rotations and metric distortions.
  - >-
    Communication is semantic triangulation: observers with different lenses (perspectives)
    contribute projections of the same attractor, enabling reconstruction of objective truth.
  - >-
    The 'heart' operator (coherence) quantifies attractor stability, varying based on the observer's
    lens, suggesting meaning is observer-dependent on an invariant structure.
  - >-
    Fractal recurrence of geometric patterns across DNA, neural activity, and semantic space
    suggests a fundamental, unifying geometry of information.
  - >-
    Distributed semantic measurement (global ommatidium) can aggregate diverse perspectives to
    reconstruct invariant attractors, enabling collective intelligence and concept discovery.
  - >-
    P-Series protocols represent fundamental attractors, analogous to elements in a periodic table,
    discovered through consensus reality and cross-domain validation.
