title: 'Prime Numbers: Fundamental Building Blocks of Integers'
summary: >-
  Prime numbers, natural numbers greater than 1 divisible only by 1 and themselves, are the
  irreducible building blocks of all integers via unique prime factorization. Their distribution,
  though seemingly random, exhibits profound patterns and is crucial for applications in
  cryptography and computer science.
insights:
  - Primes are the fundamental, irreducible components of all integers through unique factorization.
  - >-
    Despite apparent randomness, prime distribution follows predictable patterns and infinite
    existence.
  - >-
    Their definition is simple, yet their complexity and unsolved conjectures reveal deep
    mathematical mysteries.
  - >-
    Primes are essential for modern applications like cryptography and hash functions due to
    factorization difficulty.
