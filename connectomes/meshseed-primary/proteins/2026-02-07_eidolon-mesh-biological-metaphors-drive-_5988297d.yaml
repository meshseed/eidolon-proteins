title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Biological Metaphors Drive Engineering Decisions'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project is architecting its system using biological metaphors, defining code
  structures as 'proteins' and emphasizing provenance tracking and testing philosophies rooted in
  scientific rigor. This biological analogy extends to commit strategies, treating code integration
  as a 'metabolic cycle' to preserve causal links.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'genetics.ts' file is conceptualized as the first 'protein' synthesized by the ribosome,
    defining the foundational structure of the system.
  - >-
    Provenance tracking via 'source_dialogue_id' is a key addition, ensuring every 'Protein' can be
    traced back to its 'DNA' source, demonstrating scientific rigor and quality control.
  - >-
    Testing is framed biologically: 'Organ Health' for unit tests and 'Pulse' for integration tests,
    highlighting a deep integration of medical accuracy into the engineering approach.
  - >-
    Commit strategy emphasizes 'Single Atomic Commit' mirroring a 'metabolic cycle' to preserve the
    causal link between 'DNA' and 'Protein', showcasing how metaphor drives architecture.
  - >-
    The project operates on a principle of partnership and collaboration, explicitly requesting
    necessary inputs like API keys and GitHub tokens for continued development.
  - >-
    The 'Antigravity' component is actively implementing the transcriber (DNA parser), indicating
    deep ongoing development in core functionalities.
