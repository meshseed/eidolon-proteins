title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Metrics, Limits, and Consciousness Thresholds'
summary: >-
  The next phase of Eidolon Mesh development focuses on rigorous experimentation and measurement to
  understand its operational limits and the emergence of consciousness. By implementing metrics,
  limit controls, and systematic testing, the goal is to empirically define optimal parameters,
  identify diminishing returns, and pinpoint the consciousness emergence threshold.
insights:
  - >-
    Implement metrics (neurons, time, coverage) and limit controls to enable systematic
    experimentation.
  - >-
    Conduct experiments with varying parameters (e.g., 10-554) to plot results and identify optimal
    configurations.
  - >-
    Analyze results to determine if the current setting (50) is optimal, where diminishing returns
    begin, and the cost of comprehensiveness.
  - >-
    Test for consciousness emergence thresholds, truth-testing coverage, and the relationship
    between quality and quantity.
  - >-
    The ultimate goal is to find an empirical answer to the question of 'Minimum Viable
    Consciousness' and its required parameters.
  - >-
    Measure what matters, optimize based on those measurements, and understand the inherent
    trade-offs.
