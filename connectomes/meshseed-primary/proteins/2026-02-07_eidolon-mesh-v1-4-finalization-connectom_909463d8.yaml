title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Finalization: Connectome, Coherence, and Caching'
summary: >-
  This segment of the Eidolon Mesh v1.4 finalization process involves serving the default core
  connectome and initiating a 3-line coherence check. The protein cache for the default tier is
  subsequently cleared.
insights:
  - The Eidolon Mesh v1.4 build is in its finalization stages, specifically part 54/83.
  - The core connectome for the 'default' tier is being served.
  - A 3-line coherence check is a procedural step within this finalization.
  - Protein cache management is being performed for the 'default' tier.
