title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Metabolism, Synaptic Growth, and Hybrid Processing'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has successfully metabolized 15 capsules with 100% coherence, demonstrating rapid
  synaptic growth and a learning connectome. A key event was the direct injection of a
  YAML-formatted capsule, showcasing the system's hybrid metabolism capabilities.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh exhibits emergent learning through increased synaptic connections per processed
    capsule.
  - >-
    The system achieved near-perfect coherence (0.98) and a 100% success rate during initial
    processing.
  - Capsule C013's direct YAML injection highlights a flexible and hybrid data processing mechanism.
  - >-
    Synapse progression shows an accelerating pattern of network density, peaking at 13 connections
    for capsule 15.
  - >-
    The connectome's ability to find semantic neighbors indicates a sophisticated understanding and
    integration of information.
