title: 'Cytoskeleton: Cellular Mechanics and Mechanical Memory in Talin'
summary: >-
  Cells utilize a dynamic cytoskeleton, analogous to mechanical components, to generate forces and
  transport cargo. This network connects to cellular adhesions, and specific molecules like talin
  can encode mechanical history through force-induced state changes, enabling molecular memory.
insights:
  - >-
    The cell's cytoskeleton is a complex, dynamic network of filaments (actin, microtubules,
    intermediate filaments) acting as levers, pulleys, and gears.
  - >-
    Motor proteins interact with cytoskeletal filaments to generate forces and transport cellular
    components.
  - >-
    Tension homeostasis (tensegrity) is maintained in cells when all forces and tensional restraints
    are balanced.
  - >-
    Talin molecules exhibit a novel function in molecular memory by reversibly switching between
    folded and unfolded states based on applied mechanical force.
  - >-
    The mechanical history of a talin molecule can be imprinted as a persistent pattern of state
    switches, contributing to cellular memory.
