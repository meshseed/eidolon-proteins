title: 'Eidolon Mesh: CSP Fix Enables Local LLM Ingestion'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh PWA encountered Content Security Policy (CSP) errors blocking local LLM
  connections, specifically to Ollama on port 11434. By updating the CSP in `app.html` to include
  `http://localhost:*` and `http://127.0.0.1:*` in the `connect-src` directive, these connection
  issues were resolved, allowing for successful local LLM ingestion and processing of files.
insights:
  - >-
    Content Security Policy (CSP) was blocking local LLM connections to the Eidolon Mesh
    application.
  - >-
    The specific error stemmed from the `connect-src` directive not permitting connections to
    `localhost:11434`.
  - >-
    Modifying `src/app.html` to include `http://localhost:*` and `http://127.0.0.1:*` in
    `connect-src` resolved the CSP violation.
  - A hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) is required after CSP changes to take effect.
  - >-
    Successful local LLM ingestion and processing of files are now possible after the CSP
    correction.
