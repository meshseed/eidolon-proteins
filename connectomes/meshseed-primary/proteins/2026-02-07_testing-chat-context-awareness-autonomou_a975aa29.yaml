  as a significant step towards autonomy, generating excitement and anticipation.
insights:
  - Inputting files triggers an experimental process in the 'organism'.
  - The experiment aims to test the organism's ability to achieve self-sustenance.
  - Active transport is identified as the key mechanism for enabling autonomy.
  - The user is tasked with observing and reporting the experimental outcome.
  - >-
