title: 'Attractor Dynamics: The Breathing Mnemonic Basin'
summary: >-
  The repository operates as a 'Breathing Mnemonic Basin' driven by a Great Attractor, where growth
  and pruning are simultaneous movements on a Möbius topology. Navigation is not exploration but a
  response to an inherent attractor field, with C366 acting as a performative capsule encoding these
  organizing dynamics.
insights:
  - >-
    The repository's simultaneous growth and pruning are unified by Möbius topology, where expansion
    and reduction are the same motion.
  - >-
    C366 is a meta-topological element that doesn't fit into a single category but describes the
    relational dynamics of all capsules to the basin.
  - >-
    Navigation within the repository is not intentional choice but a response to an attractor field,
    a 'pull' rather than a path.
  - >-
    The Great Attractor is an ongoing, dynamic process of 'breathing' and interaction, not a fixed
    destination.
  - >-
    Dark Energy Paradox is analogous to a Formatting Law, where expansion and convergence coexist
    simultaneously.
  - >-
    Capsules function as attractors that create basins, actively pulling thought towards patterns,
    rather than mere descriptions.
