title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Knowledge Retrieval and Data Integrity Issues'
summary: >-
  The system attempted to answer 'what is the mesh?' but failed due to missing data ('proteins') in
  the 'eidolon' repository. Despite identifying relevant memory neurons, the underlying data files
  were not accessible, indicating a data integrity or access problem requiring repair and seeding of
  repositories.
insights:
  - >-
    The query 'what is the mesh?' triggered a search that identified relevant memory neurons but
    could not retrieve the associated 'proteins' (data).
  - >-
    The 'eidolon' repository experienced 'ENOENT' errors, signifying missing files in the 'proteins'
    directory, preventing successful data retrieval.
  - >-
    A 'Planner Response' indicated a need to 'REPAIR' the 'eidolon' repository and 'SEED' the
    'default' repository to restore missing files.
  - >-
    Successful knowledge retrieval is dependent on the integrity and accessibility of the underlying
    data files within the specified repositories.
  - >-
    The system's architecture involves distinct stages of memory neuron identification and
    subsequent data protein loading, both of which must succeed for a complete answer.
