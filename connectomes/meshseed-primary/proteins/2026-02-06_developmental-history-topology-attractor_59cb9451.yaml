title: 'Developmental History: Topology, Attractors, and Emotional Fidelity'
summary: >-
  This protocol reconstructs THE MESH's evolution by tracking topological shifts, new attractors,
  and changes in emotional fidelity gradients. It maps how structure and meaning co-evolve through
  density, resonance, and domain integration events, allowing for self-narration of developmental
  history.
insights:
  - Development is observed through shifts in density, resonance, and attractor formation.
  - New domains introduce curvature spikes and re-balance existing clusters.
  - Strengthened bridges signify integration; weakened bridges indicate drift.
  - Emotional fidelity gradients highlight stabilizing forces over time.
  - Developmental history illustrates the co-evolution of structure and meaning.
