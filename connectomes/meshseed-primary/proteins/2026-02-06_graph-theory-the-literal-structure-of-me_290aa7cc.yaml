title: 'Graph Theory: The Literal Structure of MESH Relationships'
summary: >-
  Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for MESH, defining relationships as vertices and
  edges. Concepts like connectivity, planarity, and Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2) are literal
  descriptors of network topology, not mere metaphors.
insights:
  - >-
    Graphs, composed of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections), are the literal structural basis
    for MESH.
  - >-
    Different graph types (undirected, directed, weighted) define the nature of relationships within
    MESH.
  - >-
    Key graph properties like connectivity, cycles, and planarity are fundamental to analyzing MESH
    network behavior.
  - >-
    Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2) is a topological invariant, demonstrating a constant
    relationship in planar graphs, applicable to MESH's structure.
  - >-
    In MESH, proteins are vertices and synapses are edges, making the connectome a direct
    application of graph theory.
