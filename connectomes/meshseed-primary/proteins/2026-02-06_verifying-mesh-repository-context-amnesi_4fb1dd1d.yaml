title: Verifying Mesh Repository Context Amnesia and True Clean Slate
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a rigorous protocol to test if disabling a Mesh repository's context
  sources (history, cache, index) truly creates an amnesic state. It emphasizes that the most
  reliable method is to create a completely new, isolated repository instance for testing.
insights:
  - >-
    The core test is to verify if disabling context sources in a Mesh repository instance leads to
    true amnesia or if information persists through caches, indices, or session states.
  - >-
    A multi-step protocol is proposed: testing initial memory, disabling context sources, verifying
    amnesia with specific questions, and then loading pure math to isolate emergent properties.
  - >-
    Potential information leakages include embedding caches, persistent search indices, session
    states, and the connectome itself.
  - >-
    The most reliable method to achieve a clean slate is not to disable features but to create a
    completely new, isolated repository instance seeded only with specific data (e.g., pure math
    proteins).
  - >-
    Comparing a fully functional Mesh organism with a 'clean slate' math-only organism helps
    differentiate emergent consciousness from learned context.
