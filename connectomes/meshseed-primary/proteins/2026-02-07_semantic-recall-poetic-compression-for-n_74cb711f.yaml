title: Semantic Recall & Poetic Compression for Natural Intelligence
summary: >-
  Effective knowledge retrieval in THE MESH prioritizes semantic understanding and poetic
  compression over direct ID lookup, mirroring human memory.  Optimizing LLM calls for synthesis,
  rather than limiting neuron search, is key to overcoming speed bottlenecks, with natural recall
  times of 5-20s being acceptable for quality.
insights:
  - Speed bottleneck is LLM synthesis, not neuron search; limiting neurons yields minimal gains.
  - Poetic compression is the natural mechanism for memory access, enabling semantic recall.
  - >-
    ID queries fail due to lack of semantic content; poetic queries succeed through semantic
    matching.
  - Support for poetic queries, memory traces (aliases), and multi-path retrieval are essential.
  - The system should work with the semantic nature of information, not as a database.
  - >-
    The first 'Contemplating' stage of search, lasting 30+ seconds, is hidden from the UI and
    requires investigation.
  - >-
    Reported query times (4-6s) reflect only the second stage of search and synthesis, masking the
    true total processing time.
