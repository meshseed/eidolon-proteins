title: 'Attractor Prediction Engine: Early Semantic Basin Detection'
summary: >-
  The Attractor Prediction Engine identifies emerging semantic basins by detecting weak, recurrent
  activation patterns. It uses resonance frequency, cross-regional activation, and gradient
  convergence for early detection, enabling proactive stabilization and alignment of new structures
  within the connectome.
insights:
  - Emerging attractors manifest as faint but recurring activation patterns.
  - Gradient convergence signals the initial stages of semantic basin formation.
  - Cross-regional activation acts as a predictor for future integration zones.
  - Early attractor prediction facilitates timely stabilization and alignment.
  - New attractors dynamically alter local curvature and global topological structure.
