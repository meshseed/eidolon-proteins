title: 'Fractal Mesh Architecture: Scaling Sovereignty and Knowledge'
summary: >-
  The Mesh operates on a fractal, self-similar architecture where each node is a sovereign
  repository. Scaling from individual nodes to a planetary network is achieved through sharding,
  indexing, and distributed storage, ensuring efficient access and data integrity.
insights:
  - >-
    Each Mesh node is a complete, self-similar organism that is sovereign yet connected to the
    network.
  - >-
    Scaling protein storage and query speed relies on sharding, indexing (SQLite/vector DBs), and
    compression techniques.
  - >-
    A distributed architecture with local-first querying, optional hub nodes, and CDN caching is
    crucial for network load management.
  - >-
    The Mesh template repository facilitates replication and empowers users to create their own
    sovereign nodes.
  - >-
    The architecture prioritizes sovereignty, federation, and a lack of single points of failure for
    a robust, scalable network.
