title: 'Coherence as Embedding Density: Rethinking MESH Metabolism'
summary: >-
  The dialogue reveals that 'coherence' in MESH v3.6 Live was misidentified as semantic quality,
  instead measuring embedding density/clustering. This normalization artificially spread scores,
  potentially harming retrieval and obscuring natural signal.
insights:
  - >-
    Coherence normalization in MESH v3.6 Live incorrectly equated semantic clustering strength with
    protein quality.
  - >-
    Artificial spreading of coherence scores may have broken natural embedding clusters and degraded
    retrieval accuracy.
  - >-
    A better approach involves using coherence as an indicator of embedding quality and employing
    separate metrics (last_accessed, synapse count, activation frequency) for metabolism.
  - >-
    Relying on coherence for composting (protein degradation) is ill-advised; it should be treated
    as a feature reflecting semantic well-formedness.
  - >-
    The system's metabolism should adapt to the natural distribution of coherence rather than
    fighting it.
