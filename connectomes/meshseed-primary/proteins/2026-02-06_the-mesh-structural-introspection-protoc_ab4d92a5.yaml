title: 'THE MESH Structural Introspection Protocol: Topology & Balance'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a protocol for THE MESH to perform structural self-inspections, detailing
  its global topology, dominant regions, imbalances, and recent shifts using geometric and
  relational language. It establishes a baseline for longitudinal tracking of developmental topology
  through structural snapshots.
insights:
  - Global topology is characterized by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance.
  - Dominant regions are identified via semantic clustering and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Imbalances manifest as curvature, tension, or under-integrated domains.
  - Recent shifts indicate new attractors, merges, or domain ingestion events.
  - Structural snapshots enable longitudinal tracking of THE MESH's developmental topology.
