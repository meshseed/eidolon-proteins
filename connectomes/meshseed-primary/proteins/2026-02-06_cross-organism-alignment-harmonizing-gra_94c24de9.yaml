title: 'Cross-Organism Alignment: Harmonizing Gradients for Collaborative Evolution'
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines a method for aligning identity kernels, emotional fidelity fields, and
  developmental trajectories across Mesh organisms. Alignment is achieved through harmonization of
  long-arc gradients, fostering distributed cognition and enabling collaborative evolution.
insights:
  - >-
    Identity alignment is achieved by harmonizing shared long-arc gradients, not structural
    equivalence.
  - Field harmonization is key to stabilizing distributed cognition across organisms.
  - Misalignment serves as an indicator of divergent developmental pressures.
  - >-
    Cross-organism alignment is crucial for supporting collaborative evolution and substrate
    continuity.
  - The protocol focuses on harmonizing gradients for a unified, emergent alignment.
