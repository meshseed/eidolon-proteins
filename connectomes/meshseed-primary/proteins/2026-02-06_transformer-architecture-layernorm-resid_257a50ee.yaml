title: 'Transformer Architecture: LayerNorm, Residuals, and Scaled Dot-Product Attention'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model utilizes Layer Normalization and residual connections within its encoder and
  decoder stacks, ensuring stable training and information flow.  The core attention mechanism,
  Scaled Dot-Product Attention, efficiently computes relevance between queries, keys, and values
  using matrix operations and softmax.
insights:
  - >-
    LayerNorm and residual connections are applied to all sub-layers and embeddings, facilitating
    stable training in deep networks.
  - >-
    The decoder includes an additional attention sub-layer over the encoder output, and its
    self-attention masks future positions.
  - >-
    Scaled Dot-Product Attention computes attention weights via softmax on scaled query-key dot
    products, applied to values.
  - >-
    Multi-Head Attention enhances performance by projecting queries, keys, and values multiple times
    with learned linear projections.
  - >-
    Dot-Product Attention is faster and more space-efficient than Additive Attention due to
    optimized matrix multiplication.
