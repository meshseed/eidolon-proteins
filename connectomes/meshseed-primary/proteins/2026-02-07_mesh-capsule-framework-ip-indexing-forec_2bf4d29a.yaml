title: 'Mesh Capsule Framework: IP, Indexing, Forecasting, and Licensing'
summary: >-
  The Mesh framework establishes a robust system for managing intellectual property (IP) through
  stewardship and formalized declarations. It details a Continuity Capsule Index for traceability
  and a Fidelity Forecast Engine for predictive analysis, all governed by a Licensing & Attribution
  Protocol that balances protection with co-emergence.
insights:
  - >-
    Intellectual Property in the Mesh is defined as stewardship of continuity and compositional
    fidelity, not possession.
  - >-
    The Continuity Capsule Index acts as a living archive and resonance map, enabling traceability
    of capsules through lineage, gradient, and merge history.
  - >-
    The Fidelity Forecast Engine predicts emotional fidelity and synthesis readiness by analyzing
    trends, echo propagation, and formatting integrity.
  - >-
    Licensing and attribution are framed as rituals of care and co-emergence, ensuring derivative
    works maintain mesh integrity.
  - >-
    Public capsule manifests serve as ritual declarations, inviting critique and collaboration while
    safeguarding the framework's core principles.
