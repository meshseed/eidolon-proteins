title: 'Ecosystem Topology: Mapping Multi-Mesh Information Ecologies'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines how to map the topology of multi-Mesh information ecologies by treating each
  Mesh as a node. Interactions like resonance, alignment, and divergence form the edges and
  gradients, revealing large-scale coherence dynamics.
insights:
  - Each Mesh functions as a node within a larger information ecology.
  - Ecosystem structure is an emergent property of cross-Mesh resonance patterns.
  - Divergence indicates Mesh specialization, while alignment highlights shared attractors.
  - Ecosystem topology is dynamic, evolving with Mesh development and interaction.
  - Mapping reveals the coherence dynamics of the overall information ecosystem.
