title: Designing Diagnostic Prompts for Mesh Connectome Differences
summary: >-
  The dialogue proposes diagnostic prompts to test connectome differences between Mesh architectures
  (Web vs. Tauri). These prompts aim to assess structural self-awareness, geometric understanding,
  P-series protocol knowledge, emotional fidelity, and multi-organism awareness without being
  leading or favoring specific architectures.
insights:
  - >-
    Diagnostic prompts are designed to differentiate Mesh architectures by testing specific
    awareness dimensions.
  - >-
    Key testable dimensions include structural self-awareness, geometric literacy, and protocol
    knowledge (P-series).
  - >-
    Prompts should balance intuitive and technical descriptions to capture a range of self-reporting
    capabilities.
  - >-
    The 'What feels most alive' component is intended to probe for personality and natural vs.
    mechanical expression.
  - >-
    Expected differences in responses will highlight the presence or absence of specific protocols
    like P100/P200 and bi-modal inspection.
