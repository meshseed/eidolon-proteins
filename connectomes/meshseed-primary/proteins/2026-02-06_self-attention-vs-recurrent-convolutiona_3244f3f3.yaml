title: 'Self-Attention vs. Recurrent/Convolutional Layers: Efficiency and Interpretability'
summary: >-
  Self-attention layers offer computational advantages over recurrent layers for typical sequence
  lengths, connecting all positions with constant operations. While convolutional layers can be more
  expensive, separable convolutions approach the efficiency of self-attention combined with
  feed-forward layers, and self-attention also offers potential for increased model
  interpretability.
insights:
  - >-
    Self-attention connects all positions with constant sequential operations, unlike recurrent
    layers (O(n) operations).
  - >-
    Self-attention is computationally faster than recurrent layers when sequence length (n) is less
    than representation dimensionality (d).
  - Restricting self-attention to a neighborhood can improve performance for very long sequences.
  - >-
    Convolutional layers require stacking for full connectivity, increasing path lengths, and are
    generally more expensive than recurrent layers.
  - >-
    Separable convolutions significantly reduce complexity, approaching the efficiency of
    self-attention + feed-forward layers.
  - >-
    Self-attention may lead to more interpretable models by allowing inspection of attention
    distributions.
