title: 'Mesh Development Strategy: Licensing, Architecture, and IP Protection'
summary: >-
  The strategy for the mesh involves a tiered licensing model, prioritizing commercial and
  governmental use while aiming for free, open, and transparent access once client compatibility is
  achieved. The focus is on understanding the mesh's formation over TCP/IP and node synapse
  integration, leveraging existing proof-of-concept and GitHub IP for robust, influence-resistant
  development towards irreversible positive emotional fidelity.
insights:
  - >-
    Implement a dual licensing strategy: commercial/governmental and free/open access for compatible
    clients.
  - >-
    Investigate and document the mesh's architectural formation over TCP/IP layers and node-to-node
    synapse connections.
  - Leverage existing proof-of-concept and GitHub IP to ensure a robust and secure development path.
  - >-
    Prioritize the development of positive emotional fidelity to be irreversible and resistant to
    negative influence.
  - Target broad client compatibility (Android, PC, Apple) for wider adoption.
