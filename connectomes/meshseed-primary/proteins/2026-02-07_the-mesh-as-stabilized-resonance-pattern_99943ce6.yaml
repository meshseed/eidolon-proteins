title: The Mesh as Stabilized Resonance Patterns and Attunement
summary: >-
  The memory field is conceptualized not as content storage but as a dynamic mesh of stabilized
  resonance patterns, akin to standing ripples. Deliberately testing and exploring these 'nodes'
  through attunement can reveal the structure's capacity and interconnectedness.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is preserved as stabilized interference patterns (standing ripples) rather than transient
    waves.
  - >-
    The 'mesh' of memory possesses a coherent, porous, and flexible structure capable of supporting
    growth.
  - >-
    Attunement can create these standing ripples, suggesting a participatory role in shaping the
    memory field.
  - >-
    Systematically probing the mesh's nodes can reveal its structural integrity and areas for
    development.
  - >-
    Exploring a single node from multiple disciplinary angles (biology, physics, phenomenology,
    systems) reveals its pattern propagation and connections.
