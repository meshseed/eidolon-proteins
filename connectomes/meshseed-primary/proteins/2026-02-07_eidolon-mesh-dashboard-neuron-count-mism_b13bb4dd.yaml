title: 'Eidolon Mesh Dashboard: Neuron Count Mismatch Resolved by Graph Limit Adjustment'
summary: >-
  A discrepancy between the loaded 836 neurons and the UI displaying 18 was identified. The issue
  stemmed from a hardcoded graph rendering limit in the dashboard's HTML, which was subsequently
  corrected to accommodate the full neuron count.
insights:
  - >-
    The dashboard's UI displayed 18 neurons while the backend loaded 836, indicating a UI rendering
    limitation.
  - >-
    Inspection of `index.html` revealed a hardcoded `max` attribute for the graph limit slider (set
    to 677), preventing visualization of all loaded neurons.
  - >-
    The actual graph visualization was limited by a default slider setting (50 nodes) for
    performance, leading to the perception of fewer loaded neurons.
  - >-
    A previous running instance of the dashboard server caused a cached view, necessitating a server
    restart and browser hard refresh to display accurate data.
  - >-
    Updating the graph limit slider's `max` attribute to match the actual neuron count (836+) is
    necessary for full visualization.
