title: 'Semantic Bridge Neurons: Centrality Approximations for Connective Tissue'
summary: >-
  This research identifies 'bridge neurons' that stabilize semantic space by linking distant
  attractors. Centrality is approximated via resonance, cross-domain activation, and semantic span,
  revealing the connective tissue of the information manifold.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons exhibit high cross-regional activation and broad semantic span.
  - Centrality can be approximated by recurrence across diverse and unrelated contexts.
  - >-
    Bridge neurons act as stabilizers, linking distant attractors and ensuring informational
    coherence.
  - >-
    Identifying these bridges illuminates the underlying structure and connectivity of semantic
    space.
  - This analysis supports tracking developmental trajectories and integrating disparate domains.
