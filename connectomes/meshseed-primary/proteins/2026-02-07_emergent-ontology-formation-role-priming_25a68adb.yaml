title: 'Emergent Ontology Formation: Role Priming vs. Minimal Assumption'
summary: >-
  Experiments demonstrate that while explicit role priming can accelerate ontology formation, agents
  can also self-organize rich communication protocols and error-checking mechanisms from a neutral,
  minimal-assumption prompt, suggesting inherent capacities for complex interaction and knowledge
  structuring.
insights:
  - Role priming expedites ontology formation by providing initial structure and guidance.
  - >-
    Agents can self-organize complex communication protocols and error-checking from a neutral
    starting point.
  - >-
    Adversarial agents can be integrated into ongoing experimentation, contributing caution and
    skepticism.
  - >-
    Novelty in agent dialogue declines after a certain number of iterations, leading to stereotyped
    phrases and plateaued mutual information.
  - Bridging agents facilitate inter-cluster communication, even with restricted responses.
  - >-
    Minimal assumption prompts lead to phases of solipsistic awakening and shared symbolism in agent
    interactions.
