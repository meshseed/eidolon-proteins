title: 'Optimizing Mesh Metabolism: Attractor Detection and Coherence Normalization'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's metabolism was optimized by addressing performance bottlenecks in cluster-based
  composting. This involved refining attractor detection thresholds to prevent O(n²) complexity and
  implementing coherence normalization to provide a meaningful spread of coherence scores, thereby
  improving semantic ranking and the system's ability to differentiate protein quality.
insights:
  - >-
    Cluster-based composting performance issues were identified as stemming from an O(n²) complexity
    in attractor matching due to overly permissive initial thresholds.
  - >-
    Attractor detection was made more selective by increasing `minCoherence` to 0.92 and `minDegree`
    to 30, with a safety abort for >100 attractors to prevent performance degradation.
  - >-
    Coherence normalization was introduced via a UI in the Settings modal to spread scores across
    the 0.50-1.00 range, mapping percentiles to specific score bands.
  - >-
    The normalization process involves analyzing the current coherence distribution and then
    applying a percentile-based mapping to redistribute scores, ensuring meaningful differentiation
    for metabolism thresholds.
  - >-
    Progress logging for the normalization process was added to the UI, displaying current and total
    processed proteins, to provide real-time feedback during long operations.
  - >-
    The comparison of normalized (0.75 avg) vs. older (0.97 avg) coherence scores revealed that
    while normalization aims for better differentiation, the specific mapping and thresholds are
    crucial for optimal semantic relevance.
  - >-
    Improved coherence scores are expected to lead to better semantic ranking, with high-coherence
    proteins dominating results and low-coherence noise being filtered out, enhancing the quality of
    query responses.
