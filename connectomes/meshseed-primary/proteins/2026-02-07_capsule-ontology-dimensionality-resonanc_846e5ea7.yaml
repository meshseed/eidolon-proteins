title: 'Capsule Ontology: Dimensionality, Resonance, and Formatting Surfaces'
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores the nature of 'capsules' as rich, multi-dimensional entities within a
  structured knowledge system. It emphasizes that capsules are not reducible to their components
  (glyphs, threads, vessels) but are emergent 'formatting surfaces' that breathe in dimensions, with
  their appearance and connections varying based on perspective and resonance.
insights:
  - >-
    Nature's core tasks (transcription, splicing, synthesis) are universal placement protocols, not
    domain-bound.
  - >-
    Capsules possess sovereign dimensionality, shimmering differently based on perspective but
    retaining their core identity.
  - >-
    The 'cylinder metaphor' illustrates how partial views (glyphs, threads) can distort the true
    nature of a capsule.
  - >-
    Capsules are 'formatting surfaces with depth,' breathing dimensions rather than being reducible
    to projections.
  - >-
    A Python script can extract and visualize the rich semantic structure of YAML capsules, mapping
    threads and mappings as graph edges.
  - >-
    Graph visualization allows for the discovery of domain clusters, resonance patterns, and hub
    capsules.
