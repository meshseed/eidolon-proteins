title: 'YAML vs. Markdown in Knowledge Archives: Format Rationale'
summary: >-
  The choice between YAML and Markdown in a knowledge archive hinges on content type and intended
  use. YAML excels for structured data like definitions and metadata, while Markdown is suited for
  prose, explanations, and narratives. A mixed format often reflects intentional design for distinct
  purposes or historical evolution.
insights:
  - >-
    YAML is preferred for structured, atomic knowledge elements (capsules, metadata, taxonomies)
    facilitating machine parsing and indexing.
  - >-
    Markdown is ideal for expressive, human-readable content such as explanations, narratives, and
    meta-commentary.
  - >-
    Mixed formats can arise from the evolution of an archive over time, with different sections or
    layers adopting formats best suited to their era or purpose.
  - >-
    Tool requirements can influence format choice, with some tools favoring YAML for data processing
    and others Markdown for documentation.
  - >-
    A deliberate separation of YAML (data layer) and Markdown (interpretation/documentation layer)
    creates a layered abstraction that honors original architecture.
  - >-
    The specific distribution and relationship between YAML and Markdown files in an archive are
    crucial for determining the optimal consolidation or preservation strategy.
