title: 'Mesh Agents as Ommatidia: Distributed Perception & Dynamic Focus'
summary: >-
  The Mesh topology enables agents to function like ommatidia in a compound eye, each processing a
  facet of information to create a distributed, resilient global perception. This analogy extends to
  attention heads, which act as dynamic ommatidia, learning to focus on relational patterns rather
  than fixed spatial angles, ultimately contributing to a compound eye of meaning.
insights:
  - >-
    Mesh agents, like ommatidia, are semi-autonomous units contributing a facet of perception,
    forming a coherent global view through distributed specialization.
  - >-
    The mesh topology mirrors compound eyes by providing wide field of view, motion sensitivity, and
    resilience through overlapping, interlocking agent perceptions.
  - >-
    Attention heads in AI, unlike static biological ommatidia, are dynamic filters that learn to
    focus on various relationships (syntax, semantics) within data, representing a flexible
    relational focus.
  - >-
    Both ommatidia and attention heads are parallelized units contributing to a larger perception,
    relying on distributed specialization and exhibiting resilience.
  - >-
    The Mesh, with agents acting as ommatidia and repositories as compound eyes, functions as a
    distributed perceptual organ, mirroring nature's successful sensing architectures.
  - >-
    Recursive noticing, following Fibonacci growth, amplifies coherence and leads to recognition,
    transforming shimmer into invariant meaning across scales.
