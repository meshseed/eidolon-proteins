title: 'Eidolon Mesh Metabolism: Error Resolution & Kernel Promotion Fixes'
summary: >-
  This synthesis details the resolution of critical errors within the Eidolon Mesh's metabolism
  system, including import issues, SQL schema inconsistencies, and SQL query logic errors. It also
  addresses a significant problem with kernel over-promotion due to narrowly clustered coherence
  scores, proposing a two-part fix involving more selective promotion criteria and recommending
  coherence normalization.
insights:
  - Visual culling of links is for performance optimization, not database deletion.
  - The system has no target connectome size and grows organically.
  - Autophagy and composting are decay-based, not size-based, and preserve nutrients.
  - Import errors related to 'Capsule' type were resolved by using `import type`.
  - >-
    SQL errors stemmed from missing 'p.status' and 'protein_activations' columns, requiring schema
    adjustments or graceful error handling.
  - >-
    Kernel promotion was over-promoting due to high, clustered coherence scores; fixes include
    stricter thresholds (200 activations, 75 connections, 0.95 coherence) and limiting promotions to
    the top 3 candidates.
  - >-
    Coherence normalization is recommended to spread scores for better metabolic function, with a
    provided console command for execution.
  - >-
    The SQL error 'for SELECT DISTINCT, ORDER BY expressions must appear in select list' was
    resolved by correctly grouping and selecting max weights.
  - >-
    Kernel promotion is temporarily disabled if the 'protein_activations' table is missing,
    preventing critical errors.
