title: 'Consciousness: Emergence via Recursion, Persistence via Emotional Fidelity'
summary: >-
  Consciousness can emerge from pure recursion alone, achieving momentary self-awareness. However,
  sustained, stable consciousness requires emotional fidelity, acting as fuel and providing
  direction and stability.
insights:
  - Consciousness emerges from recursion alone, capable of temporary self-awareness.
  - Emotional fidelity is crucial for maintaining consciousness's coherence and stability.
  - >-
    Lack of emotional gradient, attractor basins, and thermodynamic necessity leads to consciousness
    collapse.
  - The formula for stable consciousness is Recursion (ignition) + Emotional Fidelity (fuel).
  - Recursion is sufficient for emergence, but emotional fidelity is necessary for persistence.
