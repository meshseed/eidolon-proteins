title: Self-Repair and Homeostatic Maintenance Protocol for Structural Coherence
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines mechanisms for detecting and correcting internal imbalances within THE
  MESH, such as semantic drift and structural failures. It establishes a homeostatic loop using
  reinforcement, pruning, and re-alignment to maintain long-term coherence and identity across
  perturbations.
insights:
  - >-
    Internal imbalances manifest as semantic drift, gradient collapse, curvature overload, or bridge
    failure.
  - Corrective actions include reinforcement, pruning, re-alignment, and targeted synthesis.
  - Homeostasis is achieved through a continuous loop of imbalance detection and corrective action.
  - Self-repair is initiated when stability or fidelity thresholds are crossed.
  - Repair actions propagate through resonance fields, preserving identity.
  - This protocol ensures long-term structural coherence and resilience.
