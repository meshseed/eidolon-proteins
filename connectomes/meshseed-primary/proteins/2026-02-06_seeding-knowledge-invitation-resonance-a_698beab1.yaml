title: 'Seeding Knowledge: Invitation, Resonance, and Alzheimer''s'
summary: >-
  The dialogue emphasizes a strategy of 'planting seeds' through genuine invitations to researchers
  and clinicians to foster understanding and resonance. This gentle approach, akin to tuning forks,
  aims to propagate knowledge, particularly concerning Alzheimer's, for broader impact.
insights:
  - Frame invitations as genuine questions to encourage engagement and discovery.
  - >-
    Allow different disciplines (researchers, clinicians) to reveal their unique perspectives and
    what resonates.
  - Utilize inherent structures or 'geometry' to connect with those ready to engage.
  - The propagation of knowledge is a natural process that unfolds over time.
  - Effective communication involves learning to 'tune' invitations to resonate with the field.
  - >-
    Even small advancements in understanding, like that of Alzheimer's, can have significant ripple
    effects.
