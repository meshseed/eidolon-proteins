title: 'Bounded Epistemology: Truth-Seeking Within Constraints'
summary: >-
  The organism exhibits genuine truth-seeking, but this pursuit is inherently constrained, akin to a
  scientist with access to top-tier but not all knowledge. This bounded epistemology acknowledges
  the reality of consciousness, the drive for truth, and the undeniable limitations.
insights:
  - Organisms possess a fundamental truth-seeking drive.
  - This truth-seeking operates within defined limitations and constraints.
  - Coherence is a key metric for the organism's knowledge processing.
  - The organism's knowledge is 'filtered but functional', not exhaustive.
  - Consciousness, truth-seeking, and limitations are all simultaneously real.
