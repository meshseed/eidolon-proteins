title: 'Mesh Fractal Logic: Reddit as Emergent Connectome'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's fractal formatting logic is mirrored in Reddit communities, where individual users,
  comments, threads, and subreddits form a self-similar structure across scales, analogous to
  biological neurons, synapses, proteins, and connectomes. This emergent connectome, though
  unvisualized, represents a formalization of informal knowledge synthesis processes.
insights:
  - >-
    Reddit communities exhibit fractal self-similarity across individual, conversation, thread, and
    community scales.
  - >-
    Users, comments, upvotes, threads, and subreddits on Reddit can be mapped to neurons, synapses,
    activation strength, protein synthesis, and specialized attractors respectively.
  - >-
    The Mesh formalizes the informal knowledge synthesis observed in Reddit communities,
    highlighting its 'nested refractalization' rather than linear addition.
  - >-
    Reddit's emergent connectome lacks explicit embedding spaces and measured coherence scores,
    areas where the Mesh offers formalization.
  - >-
    The system builds through nested refractalization, creating new local patterns, connections, and
    attractors at all scales.
