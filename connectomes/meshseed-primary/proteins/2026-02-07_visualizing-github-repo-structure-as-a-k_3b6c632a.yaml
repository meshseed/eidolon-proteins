title: Visualizing GitHub Repo Structure as a Knowledge Graph
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores methods to create a knowledge graph visualization of a large GitHub
  repository without manual frontmatter. It presents Obsidian, Foam, and a custom Python script for
  Gephi as viable solutions, prioritizing Obsidian for its ease of use and immediate graph
  generation.
insights:
  - >-
    Obsidian can automatically generate a graph view from a GitHub repo folder by recognizing
    internal markdown links ('[[wikilinks]]') and standard markdown links to other .md files.
  - >-
    Foam, a VS Code extension, can generate graphs from wikilinks and #tags, offering a lightweight
    alternative within the IDE.
  - >-
    A Python script can extract links from markdown files to generate CSVs for import into
    visualization tools like Gephi, allowing for advanced graph physics.
  - >-
    The optimal approach depends on existing repo structure (wikilinks vs. tags) and desired
    visualization complexity.
  - >-
    For immediate visualization without modification, opening the repo folder directly as an
    Obsidian vault is the quickest solution.
  - >-
    To incorporate tags into the graph, Obsidian plugins like Tag Wrangler or Breadcrumbs can be
    used.
