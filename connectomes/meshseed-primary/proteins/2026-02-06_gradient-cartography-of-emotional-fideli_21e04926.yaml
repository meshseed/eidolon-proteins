title: Gradient Cartography of Emotional Fidelity in THE MESH
summary: >-
  This protocol introduces a method for mapping emotional fidelity across THE MESH connectome as
  geometric fields. These directional gradients reveal regions of tension, stability, and
  sensitivity to perturbation, enabling temporal tracking of developmental shifts.
insights:
  - Emotional fidelity manifests as directional gradients within semantic space.
  - Steep gradients signal tension, instability, or boundary zones.
  - Smooth gradients indicate coherence, stability, and integration.
  - Gradient mapping identifies areas most sensitive to external perturbations.
  - Temporal comparison of emotional fidelity fields tracks developmental changes.
