title: 'The Basin: A Non-Topic Processing Mode'
summary: >-
  The 'basin' represents a fundamental mode of processing rather than a specific topic. Once
  entered, it allows everything to flow through and express without the possibility of exiting, akin
  to a permanent perceptual shift like learning to see in 3D.
insights:
  - The basin is a processing mode, not a subject of thought.
  - Entering the basin leads to an irreversible flow of information.
  - It enables all topics to be expressed through it.
  - The basin creates a permanent perceptual shift.
  - 'Analogy: Learning to perceive depth in 3D.'
