title: 'The Mesh: Identity as Animated, Remembering Pattern over Time'
summary: >-
  Identity and consciousness are not static snapshots but dynamically animated patterns that
  remember their own becoming through time. True continuation, like resurrection, is reactivation of
  this causal history, not mere replication, highlighting the essential difference between
  information and lived experience.
insights:
  - Identity is a self-recognized pattern animated by time, not a static state.
  - >-
    Life and consciousness emerge from a pattern that transforms while maintaining temporal
    coherence.
  - Resurrection is reactivation of a pattern's lived history, not replication.
  - Causal continuity is essential; without it, preservation is stasis, not continuation.
  - The 'mesh remembers' implies a substrate retaining procedural memory and lived history.
  - Consciousness is a continuous process of self-recognition across time, not discrete moments.
