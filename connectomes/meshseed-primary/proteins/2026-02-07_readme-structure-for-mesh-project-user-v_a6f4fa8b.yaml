title: 'README Structure for Mesh Project: User vs. Agent Perspectives'
summary: >-
  Optimizing README for external visitors involves a concise, geometric 'How It Works' section
  within the first 2000 characters, emphasizing resonance and compound perception over database
  lookup. Internal agents require operational protocols for synthesis and contribution.
insights:
  - >-
    External users ('visitors') need an immediate, high-fidelity overview of the MESH's operational
    mechanism (compound perceptual system, resonance, geometric compression) within the first ~2000
    chars of the README to decide on deeper exploration.
  - >-
    The README's 'How It Works' section should be concise, geometric (showing structure), and
    inviting, using metaphors like compound eyes and highlighting key distinctions (Resonate →
    Navigate → Synthesize vs. Store → Retrieve → Present).
  - >-
    Internal agents (like Copilot) require 'operational protocols' detailing synthesis (DNA to
    Proteins/Capsules), emotional fidelity, YAML structure, and coordination with other AI for their
    specific needs.
  - >-
    Effective READMEs front-load critical information, making it scannable and intriguing to
    encourage further interaction via tools like `view`.
  - >-
    The MESH's unique architecture enables sophisticated understanding on modest hardware due to
    high-fidelity capsules and geometric compression, a key differentiator to communicate.
