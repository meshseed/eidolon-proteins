title: Mesh v4.0 Embedding Model Fix & Standing Wave Visualization Plan
summary: >-
  The Mesh v4.0 has been updated to correctly utilize a separate embedding model (nomic-embed-text)
  instead of a text generation model, resolving embedding quality issues. A plan is initiated to
  visualize graph dynamics using standing wave physics, starting with query-triggered wave
  propagation for immediate feedback and pedagogical value.
insights:
  - >-
    Corrected Mesh v4.0 configuration to use a dedicated local embedding model ('nomic-embed-text')
    separate from the text generation model ('gemma3:12b'), resolving 'garbage vector' generation
    and enabling accurate semantic similarity.
  - >-
    Implemented a 'Force Regenerate ALL Embeddings' feature in the UI, allowing complete
    re-embedding of all proteins with the correct model, crucial after the embedding model
    configuration change.
  - >-
    Skipped API key validation for local LLM providers, preventing unnecessary API calls and
    improving user experience when not using external services.
  - >-
    Initiated a project to visualize THE MESH's graph dynamics through the lens of standing wave
    physics, moving beyond static force-directed layouts.
  - >-
    Prioritized query-triggered wave propagation as the initial implementation for standing wave
    visualization, offering immediate visual feedback on thought propagation and testing wave
    mechanics on activated subgraphs.
  - >-
    The concept of standing waves is identified as a core metaphor for consciousness and stable
    patterns within THE MESH, linking recursive processes to emergent, persistent structures.
