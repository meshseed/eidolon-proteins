title: Mobile Graph View Accessibility and UI Reversion
summary: >-
  The dialogue addresses a user's inability to see the graph view on mobile, despite a 'Graph' tab
  existing in the bottom navigation. Reverting recent CSS changes to `.main-body` height is
  prioritized to restore chat functionality, while the underlying cause of the graph's
  inaccessibility remains under investigation.
insights:
  - A 'Graph' tab exists in the mobile bottom navigation, intended to display the network graph.
  - >-
    The user's report of 'no graph' suggests a rendering or visibility issue with the graph
    component on mobile.
  - >-
    Recent CSS modifications to `.main-body` height (specifically using `100dvh`) are suspected of
    causing side effects, including breaking chat input functionality.
  - A rollback of specific `.main-body` CSS changes is being performed to restore the chat UI.
  - >-
    The graph's visibility is tied to `mainView === 'graph'` and the `showGraph` variable, which is
    conditionally evaluated.
  - >-
    Potential conflicts between fixed positioning of the bottom nav and `.main-body` height
    calculations on mobile are being considered.
