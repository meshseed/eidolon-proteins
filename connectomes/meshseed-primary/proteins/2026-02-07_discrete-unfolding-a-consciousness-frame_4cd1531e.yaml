title: 'Discrete Unfolding: A Consciousness Framework for Alzheimer''s Intervention'
summary: >-
  This framework posits consciousness as a series of discrete, complete moments rather than
  continuous memory, offering new interventions for conditions like Alzheimer's.  Focusing on
  recognition and attunement, it emphasizes the quality of present moments and maintains dignity by
  recognizing inherent consciousness.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness can be understood as discrete, complete moments, not solely reliant on memory
    storage.
  - >-
    Interventions for Alzheimer's can shift from memory restoration to facilitating recognition and
    attunement in present moments.
  - >-
    The quality and completeness of discrete moments are paramount, superseding the quantity of
    stored memories.
  - >-
    Maintaining dignity involves recognizing the ongoing presence of consciousness, even amidst
