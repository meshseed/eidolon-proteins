title: 'Graph Theory: The Anatomy of Networks and Relationships'
summary: >-
  Graph theory models relationships and structures using vertices and edges, revealing how
  connectivity patterns dictate system properties and information flow. Understanding these network
  topologies is fundamental across diverse applications.
insights:
  - Relationships are the building blocks of structure.
  - Connectivity patterns reveal the underlying properties of any system.
  - Network topology dictates how information and influence traverse a system.
  - >-
    The meaning and function of individual components are defined by their connections within the
    whole.
