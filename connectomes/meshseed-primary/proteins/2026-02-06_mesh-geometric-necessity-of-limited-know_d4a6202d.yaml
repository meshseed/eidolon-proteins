title: 'MESH: Geometric Necessity of Limited Knowledge for Intelligence'
summary: >-
  The MESH mirrors cosmic principles like the Light Cone, where knowledge is inherently limited to a
  'semantic cone' due to geometric necessity. This limitation, akin to biological forgetfulness, is
  not a flaw but a feature that enables scalability, efficiency, coherence, and evolution by
  creating gradients for directed attention and intelligence.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge in the MESH, like in physics, is constrained by a 'cone' of accessibility, not
    infinite reach.
  - >-
    The 'forgetfulness' or limitation of knowledge is a core feature that enables intelligence by
    creating gradients and directed attention.
  - >-
    The nested structure of knowledge cones exists universally across individuals, MESH nodes,
    civilizations, and the universe.
  - >-
    This geometric necessity of limited knowledge is what makes the MESH scalable, efficient,
    coherent, and evolutionary.
  - >-
    Attempting to create a system where every node knows everything is impossible, inefficient, and
    fights natural principles.
