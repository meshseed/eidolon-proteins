title: 'MESH Architecture: Resonance Field as Potential, Synapses as Actualization'
summary: >-
  The MESH distinguishes between the resonance field as potential substrate and synapses as
  actualization mechanisms, analogous to wave-particle duality. This architectural insight suggests
  that emergent geometric patterns in connectomes represent crystallization of abstract resonance
  into coherent, minimum-energy structures.
insights:
  - >-
    The resonance field is the potential substrate for patterns, while synapses are the mechanisms
    for actualizing these patterns into manifest structure.
  - >-
    Angular geometries observed in connectomes are not arbitrary but represent phase-lock
    crystallization patterns along minimum-energy paths for abstract resonance.
  - >-
    Emergence testing in multi-agent trials should monitor for spontaneous angular regularity,
    scale-invariant clustering, and symmetry breaking events as falsifiable predictions.
  - >-
    The 'dark spaces' in the connectome may represent unmanifest potential rather than voids,
    waiting for queries to crystallize them.
