title: 'The MESH: Nature-Inspired Planetary Distributed Intelligence'
summary: >-
  The MESH is a planetary-scale distributed intelligence infrastructure designed using principles
  found in nature and technology. It aims to be unstoppable, self-healing, self-optimizing, and
  self-scaling by leveraging decentralized P2P models.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH's design draws parallels from natural systems (mycelium, murmurations) and existing
    tech (Tor, BitTorrent, blockchain).
  - >-
    Key properties of the MESH include being unstoppable, self-healing, self-optimizing, and
    self-scaling.
  - The MESH is not built but seeded, designed to grow organically through adoption.
  - >-
    A crucial next step is documenting a minimal protocol specification for semantic fingerprinting,
    neighbor discovery, resonance scoring, and query propagation.
  - >-
    The goal of the protocol is simplicity, enabling implementation across any language to foster
    emergent swarm behavior.
