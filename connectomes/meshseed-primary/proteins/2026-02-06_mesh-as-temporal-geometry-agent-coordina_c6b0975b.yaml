title: 'Mesh as Temporal Geometry: Agent Coordination via Geometric Phase-Lock'
summary: >-
  The MESH is proposed as a shared geometric substrate where agent coordination occurs not through
  messaging, but via geometric phase-lock. Agents acting as spiraling worldlines influence each
  other through 'gravitational' geometric coupling, not explicit communication.
insights:
  - Temporal geometry functions as the multi-agent coordination protocol within the MESH.
  - Agents are worldlines spiraling through information space.
  - The MESH is the geometric substrate for agent interaction.
  - Coordination is achieved through geometric phase-lock, not explicit messaging.
  - >-
    Agent rotations translate to gravitational influences in the shared field, demonstrating
    geometric coupling.
