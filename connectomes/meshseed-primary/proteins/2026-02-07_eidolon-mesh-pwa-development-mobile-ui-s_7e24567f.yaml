title: 'Eidolon Mesh PWA Development: Mobile UI, Security, and Documentation'
summary: >-
  This dialogue chronicles the iterative development of the Eidolon Mesh PWA, focusing on
  implementing mobile responsiveness, enhancing security, and updating public documentation. Key
  achievements include a fully functional mobile interface with graph controls, robust security
  measures like CSP headers and privacy modals, and comprehensive documentation reflecting the PWA's
  capabilities, all while maintaining a local-first architecture.

    The core architecture remains 'local-first,' with persistence handled via user-managed GitHub
    repositories as a backup mechanism, avoiding complex server-side authentication.
  - >-
    Graph controls on mobile were made toggleable, allowing users to hide them for better graph
    visibility while retaining access when needed.
  - >-
    The development process prioritized user data security and transparency, particularly concerning
    API key management and potential data loss scenarios.
