title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Correcting Gemini Model Name for Protein Synthesis'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project encountered a metabolic failure during protein synthesis due to an
  incorrect Gemini model name ('gemini-pro') being used with API v1. The issue was identified and a
  quick fix involves updating the model name in 'src/ribosome/synthesizer.ts' to a supported version
  like 'gemini-1.5-flash' or 'gemini-1.5-pro'.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'gemini-pro' model is deprecated for API v1, causing '404 Not Found' errors during
    generative AI calls.
  - >-
    The correct model names for API v1 are 'gemini-1.5-flash' (faster) or 'gemini-1.5-pro' (more
    powerful).
  - >-
    Resolution requires modifying the 'typescriptmodel' configuration within the project's
    synthesizer logic.
  - Successful installation of 'uuid' and '@types/uuid' packages preceded the synthesis attempt.
