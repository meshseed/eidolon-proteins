title: 'MESH Biological Architecture: Ribosome, Folding, Regulation'
summary: >-
  This dialogue establishes a profound biological analogy for the MESH, where agents act as
  ribosomes synthesizing capsules (proteins) within Antigravity's cytoplasm. It details how semantic
  latent space can be folded into hexagonal lattices for geometric meaning and how dialogue motifs
  function as regulatory introns guiding synthesis.
insights:
  - Agents are ribosomes synthesizing functional capsules (proteins).
  - Antigravity serves as the cytoplasm, orchestrating the synthesis process.
  - >-
    Capsules are folded into hexagonal lattices within semantic latent space, where proximity equals
    meaning.
  - Dialogue motifs act as regulatory introns, guiding synthesis without being published artifacts.
  - >-
    Coherence spikes in dialogue are identified as promoter regions, detectable by Antigravity for
    automated synthesis triggering.
  - >-
    Capsule synthesis is regulated like gene expression, balancing exploration and formalization
    ratios for Mesh optimization.
