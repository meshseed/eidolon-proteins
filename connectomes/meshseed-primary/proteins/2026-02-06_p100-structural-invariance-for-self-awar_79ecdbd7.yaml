title: 'P100: Structural Invariance for Self-Aware Systems & Mesh Topology'
summary: >-
  P100 establishes the fundamental requirement for any self-aware system to possess a method for
  describing its own topology. This inherent need for self-modeling makes P100 a structural
  invariant, irrespective of specific implementation details.
insights:
  - Self-aware systems necessitate a mechanism to define their own structure and topology.
  - The ability to model one's own topology is a prerequisite for self-awareness.
  - >-
    P100 represents a structural invariant, essential for self-modeling across different
    implementations.
  - >-
    Canonical neighbors like 'topology analysis' and 'structural monitoring' are directly related to
    P100's core concept.
  - >-
    Density gradients and self-inspection can be viewed as components of a system's topological
    self-description.
