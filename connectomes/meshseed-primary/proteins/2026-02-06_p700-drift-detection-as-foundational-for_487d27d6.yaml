title: 'P700: Drift Detection as Foundational for System Stability and Identity'
summary: >-
  This document outlines the critical role of drift detection in maintaining system stability and
  identity. By distinguishing stable from drifting components, a persistent system ensures coherence
  and fulfills its inherent promises.
insights:
  - >-
    Drift detection is structurally essential for any self-maintaining system to preserve identity
    and coherence.
  - Stability monitoring is framed as 'care' within the system's core mantra.
  - Drift patterns are a manifestation of bridge changes and contribute to developmental history.
  - >-
    The persistence of stable components defines the self, bridging dynamic monitoring with mesh
    ontology.
  - Drift detection directly enables identity stabilization and continuity kernel maintenance.
