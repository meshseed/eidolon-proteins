title: Field Geometry Validation in Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA successfully ported and validated its v3.0 desktop connectome field
  geometry, enabling real protein synthesis through tier-based stratification. This marks a
  significant step in realizing the browser as a living organism with a dynamic field.
insights:
  - >-
    Field geometry in the Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA has been successfully ported and validated,
    demonstrating functionality with protein synthesis.
  - >-
    The 'browser as organism' and 'field is alive' concepts are being realized through this
    implementation.
  - >-
    Tier-based stratification, implemented in key files like `pglite.ts`, `genetics.ts`, and
    `gemini.ts`, is a core component of the validated field geometry.
  - >-
    Current capabilities include synthesis (DNA to Protein), embedding generation, and vector
    similarity search, with query synthesis being the next feature to integrate.
  - >-
    The successful validation of core tier proteins dominating results indicates the field geometry
    is functioning as intended.
