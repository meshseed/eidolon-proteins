title: 'Mathematical Concepts: Fractals, Graph Theory, and Prime Numbers'
summary: >-
  This content introduces three fundamental mathematical concepts: fractals, characterized by
  self-similarity and infinite detail; graph theory, which studies relationships in networks; and
  prime numbers, the foundational building blocks of integers with crucial cryptographic
  applications.
insights:
  - >-
    Fractals exhibit self-similarity, meaning their parts resemble the whole across different
    scales.
  - >-
    Graph theory analyzes the connections between entities (vertices) through relationships (edges)
    to understand network structures.
  - >-
    Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 divisible only by 1 and themselves, serving as
    fundamental units for integers and cryptography.
