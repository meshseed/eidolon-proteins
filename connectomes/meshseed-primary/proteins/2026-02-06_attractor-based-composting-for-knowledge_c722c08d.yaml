title: Attractor-Based Composting for Knowledge Ecology
summary: >-
  This dialogue synthesizes a technical implementation with an ecological framing to create a
  self-organizing knowledge system. The core innovation is 'attractor-based composting,' where
  clusters of related knowledge ('attractors') are merged or absorbed rather than individual data
  points ('proteins'), fostering a more coherent and resilient knowledge ecology.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge synthesis should prioritize composting at the cluster/attractor level, not individual
    protein merging, to maintain coherence.
  - >-
    A fractal, multi-scale composting system (protein, attractor, repository, federation) enables
    recursive self-organization and hygiene.
  - >-
    Adaptive forgetting via a decay coefficient allows unused knowledge to naturally fade, promoting
    efficient use of resources.
  - >-
    Attractor-based federation and composting allow for the seamless integration and natural
    selection of diverse knowledge ecosystems.
  - >-
    A unified ecological dashboard is essential for monitoring and managing the knowledge metabolism
    and its various scales.
