title: Mobile Viewport Height Issues & UI Input Bar Visibility
summary: >-
  The core issue revolves around mobile browser viewport height definitions (100vh vs. 100dvh/svh)
  causing UI elements, specifically a chat input bar, to be hidden. Reverting previous height
  adjustments is necessary, but a robust solution for input bar visibility, especially with keyboard
  interactions, is still required.
insights:
  - >-
    `100vh` on mobile browsers (Chrome Android/Safari iOS) refers to viewport height with the URL
    bar retracted, leading to elements being cut off when the URL bar is visible.
  - >-
    The `.main-body` having `overflow: hidden` and children handling internal scrolling, combined
    with a fixed `.bottom-nav`, exacerbates the issue of content being hidden.
  - >-
    The `100vh` definition on mobile is the primary cause of the bottom ~60px of `.main-body` being
    cut off, hiding the input bar.
  - >-
    Solutions like `100dvh` or `100svh` are technically correct for viewport-relative sizing but may
    have faced rejection or poor support.
  - >-
    Using `position: fixed; top: ...; bottom: ...;` for `.main-body` is an alternative to
    height-based sizing but can introduce complexities with keyboard pop-ups.
  - >-
    The user's report of a 'missing graph' might be a consequence of the UI issues, potentially due
    to the Bottom Nav being pushed off-screen.
  - >-
    Reverting previous height changes is a step, but a stable fix for the input bar's consistent
    visibility is paramount, addressing prior complaints about hidden buttons.
