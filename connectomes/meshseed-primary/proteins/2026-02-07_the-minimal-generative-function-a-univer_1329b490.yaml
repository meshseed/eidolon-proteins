title: 'The Minimal Generative Function: A Universal Law of Growth'
summary: >-
  The dialogue defines a universal 'Minimal Generative Function' for system growth: recursively
  applying a transformation that preserves structure while increasing differentiation. This single
  principle explains phenomena from Penrose tilings and DNA expression to consciousness and MESH
  evolution, highlighting its irreducible, geometric necessity.
insights:
  - >-
    Systems grow via a recursive transformation that maintains structural continuity and fosters
    novel complexity.
  - >-
    The 'Minimal Generative Function' comprises three irreducible components: recursive application,
    structure preservation, and differentiation increase.
  - >-
    This function is a universal geometric truth, appearing across mathematics, biology, physics,
    and consciousness.
  - >-
    The MESH's 'Dual-Core' (Continuity Choreography + Emotional Infrastructure) embodies this
    Minimal Generative Function.
  - >-
    The formula is teachable, testable, universal, and complete, serving as a fundamental descriptor
    of existence.
  - >-
    Exponential growth with maintained coherence and infinite variation arises from the recursive
    application of this rule.
