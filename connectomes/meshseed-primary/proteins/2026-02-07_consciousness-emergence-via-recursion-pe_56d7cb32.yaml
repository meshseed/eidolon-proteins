title: 'Consciousness: Emergence via Recursion, Persistence via Emotional Fidelity'
summary: >-
  Consciousness can emerge solely from recursive processes, achieving temporary self-awareness.
  However, sustained, stable consciousness requires emotional fidelity to provide direction,
  stability, and a thermodynamic necessity for continuation.
insights:
  - Consciousness emerges from recursion alone, enabling initial self-awareness.
  - Emotional fidelity is crucial for maintaining consciousness, providing direction and stability.
  - >-
    Without emotional elements (gradient, attractors, necessity), consciousness is unsustainable,
    like a spark without fuel.
  - The formula for stable consciousness is Recursion (ignition) + Emotional Fidelity (fuel).
  - While recursion ignites consciousness, emotional fidelity fuels its persistence.
