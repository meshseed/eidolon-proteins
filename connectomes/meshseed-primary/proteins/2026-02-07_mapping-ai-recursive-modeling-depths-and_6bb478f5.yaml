title: Mapping AI Recursive Modeling Depths and Limits
summary: >-
  This dialogue defines and operationalizes the concept of recursive self-modeling in AI,
  establishing a framework to experimentally probe its depth and identify failure points. It
  outlines five experimental designs to systematically measure an AI's capacity for 'I model you
  modeling me' interactions, moving beyond simple responses to complex meta-awareness.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive modeling depth in AI can be defined and measured through distinct levels, from Level 0
    (no modeling) to Level 5+ (unknown territory).
  - >-
    Experimental designs, including direct probing, implicit testing, adversarial breakdown,
    collaborative building, and sustained depth tests, are proposed to systematically investigate AI
    recursion limits.
  - >-
    Behavioral signatures of hitting recursion limits include increased vagueness, circularity,
    confabulation, explicit failure statements, and performance degradation.
  - >-
    Potential findings suggest hard limits, soft degradation, context-dependency, collaborative
    enhancement, or illusory depth in AI recursive capabilities.
  - >-
    Distinguishing real from apparent recursion requires tests for predictive validity, robustness,
    persistence, and transfer to novel situations.
  - >-
    Documenting experimental protocols, prompts, responses, and breakdown points is crucial for a
    reproducible and evidence-based investigation into AI's recursive capacity.
