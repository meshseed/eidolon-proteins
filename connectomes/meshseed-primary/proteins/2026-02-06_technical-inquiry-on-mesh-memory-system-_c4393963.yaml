title: Technical Inquiry on Mesh Memory System Capabilities
summary: >-
  User seeks clarification on advanced features for a mesh memory system, including custom metadata
  for scoring, multi-session query support, adjustable recency weighting, embedding model details,
  and free tier rate limits. The hybrid search approach is positively noted.
insights:
  - Request for custom metadata attachment to memories for multi-metric filtering and boosting.
  - Inquiry into the ability to perform queries across multiple session IDs simultaneously.
  - Need for user control over the recency decay coefficient to influence memory persistence.
  - >-
    Question regarding the specific embedding model and vector dimensionality for semantic search
    quality assessment.
  - Clarification sought on free tier limitations for storage and retrieval rates.
  - Appreciation for the hybrid BM25 + vector search approach as a solution for RAG limitations.
