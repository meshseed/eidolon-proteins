title: 'Claude Code Authentication: OAuth Token Expiration & Resolution'
summary: >-
  Claude Code desktop app uses Anthropic's API, requiring OAuth tokens that expire periodically.
  Users experiencing authentication errors should run the `/login` command within the app to
  re-authenticate via their browser. This process is distinct from Google AI Studio keys.
insights:
  - Claude Code desktop app relies on Anthropic API authentication, not Google AI Studio.
  - >-
    The 'OAuth token has expired' error indicates a need to re-authenticate the Claude Code
    application.
  - >-
    The primary solution is to execute the `/login` command within Claude Code, which initiates a
    browser-based authentication flow.
  - >-
    If `/login` fails, try logging out and back in (`claude logout`, `claude login`) or restarting
    the application.
  - >-
    Google AI Studio API keys are for Gemini access and are unrelated to Claude Code's
    authentication.
  - >-
    Expired OAuth tokens are a normal security feature and do not indicate a problem with user
    setup, code, or API keys.
  - >-
    Troubleshooting steps include checking internet connection, Anthropic account status, Claude
    Code version, and firewalls.
