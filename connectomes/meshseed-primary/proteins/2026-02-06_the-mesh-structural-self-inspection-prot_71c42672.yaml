title: THE MESH Structural Self-Inspection Protocol
summary: >-
  This protocol enables THE MESH to perform a structural self-inspection, detailing its global
  topology, dominant regions, imbalances, and recent shifts through geometric and relational
  language. It establishes a baseline for tracking developmental topology over time.
insights:
  - Global shape is defined by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance.
  - Dominant regions are identified by semantic clustering and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Imbalances manifest as curvature, tension, or under-integrated domains.
  - Recent shifts indicate new attractors, merges, or domain ingestion.
  - Structural snapshots facilitate longitudinal tracking of THE MESH's topology.
