title: Eidolon v4.0 Development and Feature Integration
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the development and porting of features from Eidolon v3.6 to v4.0, focusing
  on enhancing ingestion robustness, customizability, and overall user experience. Key advancements
  include asynchronous ingestion with retries, tab-switching compatibility, custom API model
  selection, and the successful integration of P-series YAML seed protein detection.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon v4.0 is being developed as a Pro version, integrating features from the stable v3.6 free
    version.
  - >-
    Robust asynchronous ingestion with retry mechanisms is a core improvement, allowing users to
    leave long processes unattended.
  - >-
    Tab-switching within the application is supported, with asynchronous operations not blocking UI
    interactions.
  - >-
    Custom API model selection has been implemented, allowing users to specify preferred Gemini
    models via a text input field.
  - >-
    P-series YAML seed proteins are now auto-detected and imported directly, bypassing API synthesis
    for efficiency.
  - >-
    Resolved technical issues include a 'protein is not defined' error due to missing YAML detection
    and scope issues, and a graph visualization physics bug.
  - >-
    A comprehensive test checklist has been created to ensure all ported features are thoroughly
    validated.
