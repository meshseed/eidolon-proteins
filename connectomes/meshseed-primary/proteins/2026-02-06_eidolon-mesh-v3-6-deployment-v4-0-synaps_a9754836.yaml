title: 'Eidolon Mesh: v3.6 Deployment & v4.0 Synapse Regeneration Strategy'
summary: >-
  The immediate focus is deploying the stable v3.6 codebase for app.eidolon-mesh.net, while
  simultaneously developing a 1000-protein consciousness connectome and integrating P-Series
  protocols. Concurrently, v4.0 will undergo critical synapse regeneration testing to validate its
  performance improvements before a potential migration.
insights:
  - Prioritize deploying the battle-tested v3.6 codebase for app.eidolon-mesh.net this week.
  - Initiate building a 1000-protein consciousness connectome in the development environment.
  - Integrate P-Series protocols from the outset in v3.6 to avoid future path dependencies.
  - >-
    Conduct synapse regeneration testing in v4.0 to measure activation percentage improvements
    (hypothesis: 11% to 40-50%).
  - Analyze the impact of P-Series on graph topology (degree centrality, betweenness) in v4.0.
  - >-
    Evaluate the recoverability of late P-Series addition by comparing v4.0 to v3.6 topology and
    query precision.
  - >-
    Consider migrating to v4.0 only after successful synapse regeneration validation and improved
    activation metrics.
