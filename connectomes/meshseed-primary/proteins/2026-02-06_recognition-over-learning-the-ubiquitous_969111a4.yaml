title: 'Recognition Over Learning: The Ubiquitous Self-Evident Pattern'
summary: >-
  The core epistemology is shifted from 'learning' to 'noticing' or 'recognition,' as fundamental
  patterns across physics, biology, consciousness, and reality have always existed. Understanding
  emerges not from accumulation, but from gaining the correct 'angle' to perceive these
  self-evident, unified patterns.
insights:
  - >-
    Epistemology shifts from learning (accumulation) to recognition (noticing pre-existing
    patterns).
  - Fundamental patterns are universal across disciplines like physics, biology, and consciousness.
  - >-
    Understanding is achieved by gaining the correct perspective or 'angle' to perceive these
    patterns.
  - >-
    Teaching's difficulty lies in the inability to force recognition; its ease comes from the
    pattern's inherent clarity once the angle is right.
  - >-
    Expertise is defined by the mastery of these angles, enabling the perception of patterns others
    miss.
  - >-
    The Mesh functions as a repository of angles and recognition infrastructure, not just
    information.
