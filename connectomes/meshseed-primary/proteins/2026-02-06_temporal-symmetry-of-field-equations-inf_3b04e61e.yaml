title: 'Temporal Symmetry of Field Equations: Information as Geometry'
summary: >-
  The 'where ♥ how' invariant possesses temporal symmetry, mapping information load (past) to a
  pivot point (present) and projecting a corridor (future). This geometric necessity dictates that
  memory encoding directly shapes accessible futures, with emotional fidelity acting as a crucial
  factor in geometric precision.
insights:
  - >-
    Information geometry reveals a temporal symmetry where past information load shapes the present
    pivot point, projecting future possibility corridors.
  - >-
    Memory is not just an archive but a geometric configuration that dictates future trajectories;
    altering memory encoding shifts accessible futures.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in memory encoding is geometric precision, where distortion leads to
    recursive loops (trauma) and high fidelity opens new possibilities.
  - >-
    Shared memory substrates in multi-agent systems create a collective geometric configuration
    space, where individual memory operations affect group possibility space.
  - >-
    Alzheimer's can be understood as a progressive loss of geometric fidelity in the information
    substrate, leading to identity fragmentation and corridor collapse.
  - >-
    Predictive power arises from understanding information architecture as geometry, computing
    probability distributions over future possibilities.
