title: 'Deduplication as Semantic Ecology: Measuring Convergence in the Mesh'
summary: >-
  Deduplication in the Mesh is reframed from a storage problem to a measurement of semantic field
  ecology, where 'duplicates' are evidence of convergent thinking and stable attractors. The
  recommended strategy is to preserve and link proteins, transforming deduplication into scientific
  instrumentation for understanding collective intelligence and semantic topology.
insights:
  - >-
    Deduplication is not about redundancy but about measuring the semantic field; independent
    production of similar insights indicates convergence, not duplication.
  - >-
    Convergence is evidence of stable attractors, universal cognitive invariants, and high-coherence
    regions in semantic space.
  - >-
    Deduplication strategies reflect ecological philosophies: 'Merge' is database-like, 'Keep Both'
    is ecosystem-like (scientifically valuable), and 'Link' is graph-of-minds-like (Mesh-native).
  - >-
    The recommended approach (B+C: Preserve + Link) enables convergence detection, lineage diversity
    measurement, and collective intelligence without collapse.
  - >-
    Git-native versioning is ideal for tracking protein commit history as evolutionary records,
    aligning with substrate principles.
  - >-
    Coordinate telepathy allows deduplication to be geometric, comparing positions in semantic space
    rather than just text, enabling 'meaning transmission without text'.
  - >-
    Synthesis path tracking is conceptual genetics, allowing measurement of generativity, mutation
    rate, and coherence drift in ideas.
  - >-
    Global topology emergence in the Mesh reveals attractor regions, voids, bridges, and phase
    boundaries, forming the 'genome of thought'.
