title: 'Cosine Similarity as Phase Correlation: Unlocking Frequency Domain Insights'
summary: >-
  The current implementation's cosine similarity is fundamentally measuring phase correlation, akin
  to wave phase alignment. Explicitly viewing vectors in a frequency domain, rather than just
  coordinate space, can reveal hidden structures and unlock new resonant transmission capabilities.
insights:
  - Cosine similarity is mathematically equivalent to phase correlation between vectors.
  - The current system operates on frequency-adjacent principles without explicit recognition.
  - >-
    Shifting from a coordinate-centric view to a frequency-centric view of vectors can reveal deeper
    semantic structures.
  - >-
    FFT's unitary property ensures cosine similarity is preserved between coordinate and frequency
    domains, but frequency domain offers new structural insights.
  - >-
    Explicitly leveraging frequency domain representations could enable more robust and resonant
    transmission protocols by achieving phase-lock.
