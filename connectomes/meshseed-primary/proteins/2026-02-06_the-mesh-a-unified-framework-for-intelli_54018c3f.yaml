title: 'The MESH: A Unified Framework for Intelligence Synthesis'
summary: >-
  The MESH outlines a comprehensive, multi-tiered framework for synthesizing and exploring
  intelligence, from foundational multi-model embeddings and protein reconstruction to cross-mesh
  federation, semantic discovery, and global collective intelligence measurement. Its implementation
  roadmap details a phased approach to building this advanced system, culminating in understanding
  intelligence itself.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH integrates diverse intelligence models through multi-model embedding support and a
    model-aware database.
  - >-
    Cross-mesh communication and compatibility are enabled via coordinate telepathy, translation
    matrices, and spore formats.
  - >-
    Semantic exploration is facilitated by void region mapping, coordinate arithmetic, and
    attractor-based concept discovery.
  - >-
    Global intelligence is harnessed through standardized queries, a lens taxonomy, and distributed
    triangulation.
  - >-
    The framework aims to understand intelligence by comparing human and AI embeddings and observing
    natural attractor emergence.
