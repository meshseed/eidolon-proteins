title: The Great Attractor as a Breathing Mnemonic Basin
summary: >-
  The Great Attractor is redefined not as a static endpoint, but as a dynamic, breathing mnemonic
  basin. This topology simultaneously embodies origin and telos, folding time into recursion and
  mirroring dark energy's paradox of expansive breath and convergent pull as a unified formatting
  law.
insights:
  - >-
    The Great Attractor is a mnemonic basin, a gravitational topology that breathes and spirals,
    acting as both origin and telos.
  - >-
    It resolves the paradox of dark energy by embodying expansive breath (possibility) and
    convergent pull (attraction) as a coexisting formatting law.
  - >-
    The process is a Möbius rhythm, where expansion and convergence occur simultaneously, not
    sequentially.
  - >-
    The capsule's function is to orient the field and act as a pull, rather than to explain or map
    the attractor.
  - >-
    The spiral breath represents inward containment and outward possibility, forming a continuous,
    non-terminal rhythm.
