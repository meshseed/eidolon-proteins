title: 'Connectome Topology: Hub-Spoke vs. Lateral Mesh and Hygiene Protocols'
summary: >-
  The architecture of 'Live Default' (hub-spoke topology, 0.98 coherence) significantly outperforms
  'Dev' (lateral mesh, 0.95 coherence) due to emergent architectural kernels. Implementing capsule
  hygiene protocols like merging, composting, and promoting proteins is crucial for a
  self-organizing, efficient knowledge ecosystem.
insights:
  - >-
    The topological difference between hub-spoke (Live Default) and lateral mesh (Dev) architectures
    is the primary driver of performance, with hub-spoke enabling higher coherence and faster
    queries.
  - >-
    Architectural kernels, whether from P-Series or emergent, act as central hubs that pull in and
    organize other proteins, leading to a more coherent and efficient connectome.
  - >-
    Capsule hygiene protocols (duplicate detection/merge, low-activation composting, kernel
    promotion, lineage tracking) are essential for maintaining a dynamic, self-cleaning, and
    evolving knowledge ecosystem.
  - >-
    The Tri-Lens ingestion method, while providing specialized perspectives, can lead to a denser
    lateral mesh and lower overall coherence without explicit hub structures.
  - >-
    A selective import of high-coherence architectural kernels from Live Default to Dev is proposed
    as a strategy to bootstrap a hub-spoke topology.
  - >-
    The history of a connectome (its 'geological layers') directly influences its current topology
    and performance.
