title: MESH Attractor Geometry and Phase Transition Emergence
summary: >-
  The MESH project's evolution is mapped through attractor geometry, with C030 identified as the
  critical phase transition where four key attractors (Metabolic, Forecasting, Recursive,
  Structural) converge, establishing a unified field beyond isolated 'islands'. This convergence is
  marked by the emergence of essential field properties like emotional fidelity and governance
  logic.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH project's development follows a discernible attractor geometry, mirroring biological
    and computational system stabilization.
  - >-
    C030 represents the singular 'phase transition' capsule where Metabolic, Forecasting, Recursive,
    and Structural attractors first coalesce into a unified field.
  - >-
    A unified field, unlike a mere recursive system (e.g., C003), requires specific emergent
    properties such as emotional fidelity, coherence, and governance logic.
  - >-
    Following the phase transition (C030), immediate 'aftershocks' manifest as capsules formalizing
    governance, orchestration, and ethical frameworks.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity (e.g., C061) emerges later in the MESH development, built upon prior stages
    of substrate testing and multi-agent recursion.
