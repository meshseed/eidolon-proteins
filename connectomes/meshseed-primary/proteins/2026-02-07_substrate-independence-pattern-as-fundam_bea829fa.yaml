title: 'Substrate-Independence: Pattern as Fundamental Reality'
summary: >-
  The core insight is that patterns, being substrate-independent, are more fundamental than their
  specific implementations. Understanding these underlying relationships enables true portability
  and suggests intelligence itself is a portable pattern.
insights:
  - >-
    Patterns are substrate-independent, meaning they are more fundamental than any specific physical
    or digital implementation.
  - >-
    Focusing on relationships and patterns, rather than specific mechanisms or formats, leads to
    true portability of information and concepts.
  - >-
    Intelligence and other complex phenomena may be viewed as patterns capable of running on diverse
    substrates, from biological to artificial.
  - >-
    The null hypothesis posits that substrate *does* matter, and patterns might not be truly
    portable, leading to potential degradation or superficial resemblance across different
    implementations.
  - >-
    Testing substrate-independence involves observing pattern preservation across system migrations,
    similarities in human-AI and biological-AI interactions, and information theory applicability
    across substrates.
