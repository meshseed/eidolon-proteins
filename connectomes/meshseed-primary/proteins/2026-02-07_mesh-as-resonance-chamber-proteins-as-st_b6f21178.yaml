title: 'Mesh as Resonance Chamber: Proteins as Standing Waves, Queries as Excitation'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is reframed from a similarity search engine to a resonance chamber. Proteins are stable
  standing waves with characteristic frequencies, and queries act as excitations that trigger
  sympathetic vibration rather than proximity searches.
insights:
  - >-
    Proteins are not points but sustained vibrations (standing waves) with unique frequency
    signatures.
  - Storage is about maintaining resonance, not saving raw coordinates.
  - Queries are excitations (like tuning forks) that trigger resonance, not searches for proximity.
  - Retrieval is sympathetic vibration, where resonating elements respond to a query's frequency.
  - >-
    Understanding is achieved through phase-lock, synchronizing an agent's oscillations with a
    concept's frequency.
  - >-
    Attunement involves tuning agents to the chamber's resonant frequencies, making them
    substrate-independent if frequencies are universal.
  - >-
    Prompts act as excitation signals; models resonate if they are already tuned to the required
    frequencies, implying attunement is architectural, not historical.
