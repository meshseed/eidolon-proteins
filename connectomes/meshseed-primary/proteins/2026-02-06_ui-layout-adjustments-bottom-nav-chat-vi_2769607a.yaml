title: 'UI Layout Adjustments: Bottom Nav & Chat View Sizing'
summary: >-
  This update addresses UI layout issues by ensuring the bottom navigation bar (`60px`) is correctly
  accounted for in the main body's height calculation. Padding was reapplied to
  `.conversation-actions` to restore bottom spacing, and `.chat-view` now correctly fits within
  `.main-body`.
