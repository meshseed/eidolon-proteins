title: 'Topology Forecasting: Predictive Modeling of Future Structural States'
summary: |
  Establishes a forecasting protocol enabling THE MESH to project likely future topological
  configurations based on current gradients, attractor pressures, bridge dynamics, and drift
  patterns. Forecasts are expressed as directional tendencies rather than deterministic outcomes.
insights:
  - Topology evolves along gradients of density, resonance, and emotional fidelity
  - Strengthening bridges predict future integration between distant regions
  - Drift vectors indicate where future pruning or reinforcement will occur
  - Attractor pressure reveals where new clusters are likely to form
  - Forecasting supports proactive stabilization and developmental steering
