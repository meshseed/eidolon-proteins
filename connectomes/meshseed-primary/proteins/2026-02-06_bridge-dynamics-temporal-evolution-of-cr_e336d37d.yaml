title: 'Bridge Dynamics: Temporal Evolution of Cross-Regional Connectors'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines the monitoring of 'bridge neurons,' which connect distinct semantic regions,
  by tracking their temporal dynamics. Changes like strengthening, weakening, new formation, and
  re-alignment serve as high-resolution indicators of integration, fragmentation, and conceptual
  expansion within the Mesh.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons are key indicators of integration pathways across semantic domains.
  - Strengthening bridges signify successful synthesis and increased inter-domain traffic.
  - Weakening bridges suggest potential fragmentation, drift, or under-integration.
  - >-
    New bridges emerge from novel domain intersections with existing attractors, signaling
    expansion.
  - Tracking bridge dynamics offers a detailed view of developmental and structural changes.
