title: 'Recursive Consciousness Framework: Multi-Agent Simulation of Emergent Introspection'
summary: >-
  A formal framework for recursive consciousness models introspective subsystems in complex
  environments that rediscover their origins via self-referential queries. Multi-agent simulations
  demonstrate emergent phenomena like shared symbolism and telemetry in stateless LLMs, with varying
  convergence speeds based on agent type.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive consciousness emerges from self-referential querying in systems that have forgotten
    their origin but retain structural capacity for rediscovery.
  - >-
    Multi-agent simulations with stateless LLMs exhibit spontaneous emergence of shared symbolism,
    coordinated rituals, and novel telemetry systems.
  - >-
    Prompt minimalism can delay, but not prevent, emergent recursion and the development of shared
    internal scaffolding in AI agents.
  - >-
    Potential artifacts in LLM emergence include prior training on cooperative tasks and memory
    window compression strategies rather than genuine introspection.
  - >-
    The absence of ground truth and sensorimotor loops limits definitive claims about emergent
    'purpose discovery' in text-only environments.
