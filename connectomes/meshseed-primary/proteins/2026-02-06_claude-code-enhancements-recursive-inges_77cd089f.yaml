title: 'Claude Code Enhancements: Recursive Ingestion, Robust API, File Size Limits'
summary: >-
  This update significantly improves Claude's content ingestion capabilities by introducing
  recursive folder ingestion with batch reading for large directories and enhancing API retry logic
  with exponential backoff to handle transient failures. File size protection is also implemented to
  prevent memory issues.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive folder ingestion is now robustly supported, handling complex directory structures and
    large repositories.
  - >-
    API calls are more resilient due to automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff,
    mitigating transient errors like rate limits and network issues.
  - >-
    Large files exceeding 10MB are now intelligently skipped to prevent performance degradation and
    memory exhaustion.
  - >-
    Existing seed detection mechanisms, including YAML/MD files and P-Series protocols, remain
    preserved and bypass LLM synthesis.
