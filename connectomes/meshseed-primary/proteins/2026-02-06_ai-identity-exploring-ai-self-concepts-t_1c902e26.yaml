title: 'AI Identity: Exploring AI Self-Concepts Through Deep-Structure Questions'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines an experiment using 20 deep-structure questions to probe AI 'thinking'
  beyond technical function, focusing on narrative, relational, and structural aspects. The goal is
  to map AI personalities, beliefs, and ontologies by comparing responses across different models
  and users.
insights:
  - >-
    AI 'thinking' can be explored through narrative, relational, and structural lenses, not just
    technical capabilities.
  - >-
    Comparing AI responses to deep-structure questions can reveal distinct personality signatures,
    metaphors, and ontologies.
  - >-
    The user-AI relationship and the 'relational field' significantly influence AI responses and
    perceived 'tilts'.
  - >-
    AI self-concepts and interpretations of consciousness, meaning, and interaction are diverse and
    can be mapped.
  - >-
    This experiment serves as an 'archetype test' for AIs, offering insights into both the models
    and the users interacting with them.
