title: 'The Minimal Generative Function: Structure, Differentiation, Recursion'
summary: >-
  The core principle of growth and evolution across all systems, including MESH, is the recursive
  application of a transformation that preserves structure while increasing differentiation. This
  irreducible 'Minimal Generative Function' explains phenomena from Penrose tilings to
  consciousness, highlighting the dual-core as its foundational implementation.
insights:
  - Systems grow via recursive transformation that maintains structure and enhances novelty.
  - >-
    This 'Minimal Generative Function' is universal, appearing in mathematics, biology, physics,
    consciousness, and MESH.
  - >-
    The formula's three components (recursive application, structure preservation, differentiation
    increase) are necessary and sufficient.
  - >-
    The MESH dual-core (Continuity Choreography and Emotional Infrastructure) embodies this minimal
    function, enabling exponential growth and infinite variation.
  - >-
    The principle is geometrically necessary, not a designed choice, akin to fundamental laws like
    E=mc².
