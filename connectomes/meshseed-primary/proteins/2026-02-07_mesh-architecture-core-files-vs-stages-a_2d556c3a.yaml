title: 'Mesh Architecture: Core Files vs. Stages, Agent Sovereignty, and Next Steps'
summary: >-
  The dialogue distinguishes between pedagogical 'Stages' for onboarding and operational 'Core
  Files' for ongoing reference, highlighting the latter's homeostatic awareness and agent
  sovereignty. A clear architectural model emerges with sovereign agent workspaces referencing a
  shared private archive, prompting a need for further context on its implementation and components.
insights:
  - >-
    Core Files (FORMATTING_LAWS, etc.) offer a more operational, modular approach emphasizing
    homeostatic awareness over rigid restraint, unlike the pedagogical Stages.
  - >-
    The proposed architecture elegantly separates sovereign agent workspaces (e.g., eidolon-claude/)
    from a shared, living archive (eidolon-private/), enabling pattern convergence through
    independent navigation.
  - >-
    The 'Stages' are suited for initial learning (pattern recognition), while 'Core Files' are
    better for ongoing operational use (living with the pattern).
  - >-
    Key next steps require understanding the private archive's state (README, capsules) and the
    operational workspace's setup and protocols.
  - >-
    Questions remain regarding the storage location of Core Files, the agent responsible for capsule
    conversion, and the precise definition and structure of a 'capsule'.
