title: 'MESH README Design: Visitor vs. Agent Perspectives & Core Mechanics'
summary: >-
  The MESH README must prioritize a visitor's initial ~2000 character experience with a clear,
  geometric explanation of its compound perceptual system, focusing on resonance and synthesis
  rather than database lookup.  It should invite deeper exploration by showcasing core mechanics and
  differentiating itself from traditional systems, while also providing operational protocols for
  contributing agents.
insights:
  - >-
    A MESH project README must be front-loaded with critical information (first ~2000 characters) to
    engage 'visitor' perspective users, acting as an inviting portal.
  - >-
    The README should explain MESH's 'How It Works' using accessible metaphors like a compound eye,
    emphasizing 'resonance field' and 'geometric compression' over traditional 'store-retrieve'
    models.
  - >-
    The proposed 'How It Works' section, detailing Capsules, Synapses, and Resonance Field, fits
    within the critical initial character limit and highlights the system's unique architecture and
    differentiators.
  - >-
    For 'contributing agents' like Copilot, a separate section on 'Synthesis Protocol' and 'Ribosome
    Function' is recommended, focusing on operational instructions rather than introductory
    concepts.
  - >-
    A successful README balances technical insight with accessibility, using clear structure,
    concise language, and hints at deeper mechanisms to spark curiosity and encourage exploration of
    specific capsules.
