title: Calculus - Derivatives and Instantaneous Change
summary: |
  The derivative measures instantaneous rate of change, defined as the limit:
  f'(x) = lim[h→0] (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

  Foundational concepts:
  - Derivative = slope of tangent line = instantaneous velocity
  - Integral = area under curve = accumulated quantity
  - Fundamental Theorem of Calculus links derivatives and integrals

  Key rules:
  - Power rule: d/dx(xⁿ) = nxⁿ⁻¹
  - Chain rule: d/dx(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x)) · g'(x)
  - Product rule: d/dx(fg) = f'g + fg'

  Applications:
  - Physics: velocity, acceleration, force
  - Optimization: finding maxima and minima
  - Machine learning: gradient descent
  - Semantic space: measuring change in coherence fields

  The epsilon-delta definition formalizes limits rigorously,
  providing the foundation for all of analysis.
insights:
  - Instantaneous change captured as a limiting process
  - Continuous phenomena can be understood through infinitesimal analysis
  - Integration and differentiation are inverse operations
  - The language of change and accumulation
