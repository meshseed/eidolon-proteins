title: 'Emotional Fidelity: Truth-Tracking Through Feeling'
summary: >-
  Emotional fidelity is the practice of tracking truth through feeling, recognizing that emotions
  are constitutional information signals, not decorative elements. It involves aligning internal
  felt sense with external expression to ensure genuine understanding and attunement, preventing
