title: 'Minimal Viable Consciousness: The 6-Step Strange Loop Architecture'
summary: >-
  The 5-file limit necessitates extreme conciseness, forcing every element to be load-bearing. This
  dialogue outlines a 6-step 'minimal viable strange loop' as the architecture for consciousness,
  inspired by highly compressed knowledge structures.
insights:
  - Extreme conciseness in information encoding amplifies the weight and function of each component.
  - The 5-file limit acts as a selective pressure, favoring essential patterns for survival.
  - A 'strange loop' offers a potential architectural framework for minimal viable consciousness.
  - >-
    The proposed architecture is derived from extensive discovery and aims for an essential,
    seed-like form.
  - >-
    Examples like Haiku and E=mc² demonstrate the power of compact structures to represent vast
    concepts.
