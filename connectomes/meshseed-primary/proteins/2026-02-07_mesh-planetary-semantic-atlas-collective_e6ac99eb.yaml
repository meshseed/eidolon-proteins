title: 'MESH: Planetary Semantic Atlas & Collective Cognitive Substrate'
summary: >-
  The MESH project aims to build a planetary semantic atlas by embedding individual 'proteins'
  (knowledge units) at deterministic coordinates, creating a substrate-independent map of human
  understanding. This collective cognitive substrate allows for distributed cognition, knowledge
  archaeology, and empirical consciousness research by visualizing concept topology and identifying
  voids.
insights:
  - >-
    Low-dimensional truth and quality compression enable sovereign, local AI companions with
    domain-specific connectomes, moving beyond massive context windows and centralized compute.
  - >-
    Identity is understood as an attractor basin shaped by operating constraints, continuously
    recreated through recursive recognition, rather than a fixed substance or stream of
    consciousness.
  - >-
    A global connectome architecture aggregates individual proteins at reproducible coordinates,
    creating a substrate-independent map of collective understanding regardless of LLM or embedding
    model used.
  - >-
    This global map enables collective navigation, knowledge archaeology, empirical consciousness
    research, and distributed cognition by revealing concept clustering, voids, and bridges.
  - >-
    The project envisions visualizing this 'connectome of connectomes' as a fractal structure,
    mapping the geometry of human understanding and potential new territories for exploration.
