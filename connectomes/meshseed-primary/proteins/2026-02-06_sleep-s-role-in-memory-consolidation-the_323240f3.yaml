title: 'Sleep''s Role in Memory Consolidation: The MeshCODE Theory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that sleep is crucial for memory consolidation, with deep sleep
  allowing for data processing and integration, and REM sleep actively writing new memories into the
  cortical MeshCODEs. This process mirrors database maintenance, requiring index rebuilding and
  reorganisation to ensure efficient data recall.
insights:
  - >-
    Sleep is essential for processing and consolidating information received during wakefulness,
    integrating it with existing memories.
  - >-
    Deep sleep may serve to stabilize newly formed memories and return the cytoskeleton and MeshCODE
    data storage to homeostasis.
  - >-
    REM sleep is hypothesized to be the active phase where the brain processes, integrates, and
    physically writes new data into specific cortical regions.
  - >-
    Memory storage in the cortex, conceptualized as a large database, requires a hierarchical
    structure, with the hippocampus potentially acting as a data management system.
  - >-
    Sleep's function might be to perform intensive data management processes, analogous to database
    rebuilding, to optimize memory storage and recall.
