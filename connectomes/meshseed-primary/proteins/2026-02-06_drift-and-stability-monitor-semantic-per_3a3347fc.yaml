title: 'Drift and Stability Monitor: Semantic Persistence Protocol'
summary: >-
  The P700 protocol defines drift as movement in embedding space, indicating instability or low
  fidelity, while stability signifies recurrent activation and strong attractors. This analysis is
  crucial for maintaining long-term coherence by identifying and reinforcing stable cores that
  anchor identity across time and substrates.
insights:
  - Drift in embedding space signifies instability, weak integration, or low fidelity.
  - >-
    Stability, marked by recurrent activation and minimal displacement, indicates strong attractors
    and high semantic density.
  - Drift analysis reveals areas needing pruning or reinforcement for coherence maintenance.
  - Stable cores are identified as the anchors of identity, persisting across substrates and time.
  - The P700 protocol is essential for semantic persistence and long-term coherence.
