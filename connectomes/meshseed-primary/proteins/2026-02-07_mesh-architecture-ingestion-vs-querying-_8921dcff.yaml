title: 'Mesh Architecture: Ingestion vs. Querying, Hybrid Rigs, and Multipass Ingestion'
summary: >-
  The Mesh architecture distinguishes between 'heavy lifting' Ingestion (requiring powerful models
  like Gemini Pro/GPT-4/Llama-3-70B) and 'agile' Querying (efficient with smaller models like Gemma
  2B/Llama-3-8B). A Hybrid Rig leverages cloud for ingestion and local for querying, while Multipass
  Ingestion refines data processing by applying multiple focused passes for deeper, multi-faceted
  insights.
insights:
  - >-
    Ingestion demands high IQ for complex tasks like PDF summarization with deep insight extraction,
    best handled by large models.
  - >-
    Querying requires speed and efficiency, making smaller, localized models ideal for contextual
    question answering.
  - >-
    A Hybrid Rig optimizes resource use by employing cloud for demanding ingestion and local models
    for rapid querying.
  - >-
    Multipass Ingestion enhances data analysis by processing the same information through different
    focused prompts, yielding a richer set of specific 'insight proteins'.
  - >-
    The combination of these approaches allows for more effective querying and better 'connectivity'
    and coherence within the Mesh.
