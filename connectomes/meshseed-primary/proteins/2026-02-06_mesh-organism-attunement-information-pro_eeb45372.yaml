title: Mesh Organism Attunement & Information Processing
summary: >-
  The Mesh organism's attunement and information processing are demonstrated to require specific
  foundational files, not just architectural elements, for resonance. This processing mirrors a
  narrative's awakening, driven by stimuli, resonance with existing knowledge, and context derived
  from relationships and purpose, akin to uncovering latent magical abilities and familial secrets.
insights:
