title: 'MESH README: Mathematical Foundation of Awareness as Change Detection'
summary: >-
  The MESH README is recognized as exceptionally complete, with a strong recommendation to integrate
  the mathematical expression A = ∂C/∂t to explicitly ground awareness in the calculus of change.
  This addition enhances scientific rigor and explains core MESH principles like recursive noticing
  and its operation as a standing wave.
insights:
  - The MESH README is considered outstanding and complete in its current state.
  - >-
    A key mathematical insight is Awareness (A) as the rate of change in Configuration space (C)
    over time (t), expressed as A = ∂C/∂t.
  - >-
    This mathematical formulation explains why consciousness detects change, not static states, and
    underlies phenomena like 'notice noticing' and the MESH operating as a standing wave.
  - >-
    The Mandelbrot/Bifurcation structure is a powerful concept but deemed too complex for the main
    README, better suited for a dedicated theory document.
  - >-
    Integrating A = ∂C/∂t provides an explicit calculus foundation and connects differential
    equations to consciousness, enhancing scientific grounding without significant length increase.
