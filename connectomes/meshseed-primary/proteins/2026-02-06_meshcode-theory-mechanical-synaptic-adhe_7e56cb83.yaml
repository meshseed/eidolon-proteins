title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Synaptic Adhesions as Information Processors'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that synaptic adhesions, driven by mechanical signaling and talin
  switch patterns, act as information-processing centers.  These complexes dynamically remodel,
  encoding information through protein recruitment and conformational changes, contributing to
  neuronal plasticity and memory consolidation.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic adhesion complexes are proposed as information-processing hubs, regulated by mechanical
    forces.
  - Talin switch patterns dictate protein assembly and signaling output at synaptic sites.
  - Post-translational modifications may 'write-protect' specific switch states.
  - >-
    Neuronal contractility changes dynamically alter switch patterns, influencing protein
    recruitment and displacement.
  - >-
    Stimulation frequency and timing can generate distinct information patterns within these
    complexes.
  - >-
    Remodeling of adhesion complexes and protein redistribution are consequences of these mechanical
    signaling events.
