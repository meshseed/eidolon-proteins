title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Neural Data Processing & Memory Consolidation via Sleep'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory formation involves protein-level mechanical switching and
  cytoskeletal communication within neurons. Sleep, particularly REM and deep sleep cycles,
  facilitates the processing, consolidation, and transfer of transient hippocampal data to long-term
  cortical storage as stable MeshCODE patterns.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory consolidation involves dynamic mechanical protein switching (talin-switches) and
    cytoskeletal activity within neurons.
  - >-
    Sleep cycles (deep sleep and REM) are crucial for processing, writing, and reordering neural
    data patterns.
  - >-
    Newly encoded memories shift from transient hippocampal storage (like RAM) to stable, long-term
    cortical MeshCODE patterns.
  - >-
    Consolidated memories are assigned specific physical addresses in the cortex for efficient
    recall.
  - >-
    Disruptions in protein fidelity (e.g., tangles) can corrupt MeshCODE, leading to memory loss and
    neurological diseases like dementia.
  - >-
    Sleep deprivation can fragment memory, impairing recall and performance due to incomplete data
    management.
