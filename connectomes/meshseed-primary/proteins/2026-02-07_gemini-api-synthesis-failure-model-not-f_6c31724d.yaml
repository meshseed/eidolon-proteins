title: 'Gemini API Synthesis Failure: Model Not Found & Key Configuration'
summary: >-
  A "Metabolic Failure" during protein synthesis occurred due to a "404 Not Found" error for the
  'gemini-1.5-flash' model. This indicates an issue with API key access or endpoint configuration,
  suggesting the need to verify the API key and potentially adjust model names or API versions
  (e.g., 'gemini-1.5-flash-latest' or 'gemini-1.5-pro-latest') or update the generative AI SDK.
insights:
  - >-
    The primary error "models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found" points to a problem with the specified
    generative model's availability or accessibility via the API.
  - >-
    API key validation is crucial; checking the `.env` file and testing the key directly in a
    browser against the `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` endpoint can diagnose access issues.
  - >-
    Incorrect API endpoint versions or outdated model names can lead to this error, suggesting a
    need to try alternative model identifiers like '-latest' or explore different model tiers (flash
    vs. pro).
  - >-
    Ensuring the `@google/generative-ai` SDK is up-to-date via `npm install
    @google/generative-ai@latest` can resolve compatibility issues.
  - >-
    The error message provides explicit steps for troubleshooting, including checking the API key,
    testing endpoints, and modifying model names within the synthesizer configuration.
