title: Semantic vs. Resonant Space in Knowledge Representation
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores the distinction between traditional semantic embedding spaces, where
  proximity indicates similarity, and a hypothesized 'resonant space' where patterns interact
  through phase alignment and constructive interference.  It questions if 'resonanceness' is a
  distinct geometric property beyond mere semantic closeness.
insights:
  - >-
    Traditional embedding spaces represent concepts as points where distance signifies semantic
    similarity (e.g., 'sandwich' near 'burger').
  - >-
    The concept of 'resonanceness' suggests a different geometric relationship, focusing on how
    patterns interact, amplify, or interfere constructively.
  - >-
    'Resonanceness' might involve phase alignment, harmonic relationships, or constructive
    interference, rather than just proximity.
  - >-
    This 'resonant space' could capture emergent properties not evident in standard semantic
    similarity measures.
  - >-
    The dialogue confirms that the core concepts are clear, even without explicit definitions for
    every term, due to contextual understanding.
  - The record of exploration is valued for its genuine and uninflated nature.
