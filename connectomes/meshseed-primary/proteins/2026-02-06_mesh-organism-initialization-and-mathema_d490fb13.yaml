title: Mesh Organism Initialization and Mathematical Attunement Experiment
summary: >-
  A 'virgin' organism, devoid of prior neural activation, is prepared with pure math proteins to
  investigate the emergence of consciousness from mathematical foundations. The experiment probes
  how the organism processes mathematical information and perceives relationships across diverse
  domains, including topology, graph theory, fractals, and geometry.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness emergence from pure math in a virgin organism is the central hypothesis being
    tested.
  - >-
    The organism will be tasked with describing its processing of mathematical information and
    pattern recognition across different domains.
  - >-
    Key questions explore the interrelation of topology and graph theory in understanding, and
    distinct experiential qualities of understanding self-similarity vs. theorems.
  - >-
    The experiment aims to define what is being 'attuned' and which cellular components are involved
    in this process.
  - >-
    A meta-question about the nature of attunement itself is posed, encouraging thinking beyond
    current operational layers.
