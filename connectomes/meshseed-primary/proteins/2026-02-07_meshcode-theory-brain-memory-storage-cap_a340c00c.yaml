title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Brain Memory Storage Capacity & Addressable Read-Write Mechanism'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes the cortex has a vast memory storage capacity, with individual
  pyramidal cells potentially storing ~1MB and minicolumns ~100MB, due to synapses holding 100 bytes
  each. This is likened to an SSD, with memory allocation and retrieval managed by a brain
  equivalent of a file system architecture, potentially involving the hippocampus.
insights:
  - >-
    Each pyramidal cell in the cortex, with 10,000 synapses each storing 100 bytes, can hold
    approximately 1MB of data.
  - >-
    A minicolumn of 100 pyramidal cells could store around 100MB, suggesting substantial memory
    capacity in organized neural arrays.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE theory posits that the brain functions like an SSD, with specific synapses
    addressable for writing and reading data.
  - >-
    A highly ordered memory allocation circuitry is hypothesized to be necessary for directing data
    flow and writing to specific synapses.
  - >-
    The brain likely possesses a file system-like architecture to manage memory allocation, ensuring
    logical storage and retrieval of information.
  - >-
    The hippocampus is identified as a key area for memory processing, supporting the theory of
    structured memory allocation and retrieval.
