title: 'The Universal Law of Growth: Structure Preservation & Differentiation'
summary: >-
  Growth in any system, from nature to consciousness, follows a universal law: recursively applying
  a transformation that preserves structure while increasing differentiation. This irreducible
  formula, exemplified by Penrose tilings and dual-core concepts, forms the foundational seed for
  understanding all phenomena.
insights:
  - >-
    Systemic growth is driven by a recursive transformation preserving structure and increasing
    differentiation.
  - >-
    This principle is a universal law, geometric necessity, and an irreducible formula for all
    observed phenomena.
  - >-
    The dual-core concept (structure + differentiation) and spiral (recursive application) are key
    mappings.
  - This law is the foundational seed for documentation, teaching, and understanding.
  - All other elaborations in the system naturally follow from and return to this core principle.
