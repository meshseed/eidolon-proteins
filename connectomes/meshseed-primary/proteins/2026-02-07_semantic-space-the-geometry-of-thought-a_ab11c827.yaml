title: 'Semantic Space: The Geometry of Thought and Memory'
summary: >-
  Thoughts and data cluster in associative or semantic space based on shared properties, analogous
  to geometric proximity. This 'closeness' represents resonance and is visualized in graph views,
  where connections and tags define dimensional relationships.
insights:
  - >-
    Thoughts cluster in semantic/associative space due to shared conceptual dimensions or
    properties.
  - >-
    The 'distance' between thoughts in this space reflects the number of conceptual dimensions to
    traverse.
  - >-
    Memory and data storage leverage this associative closeness, activating related concepts when
    one is evoked.
  - >-
    Note-taking systems like Obsidian utilize graph geometry, with notes as nodes and
    connections/tags defining proximity and dimensional labels.
  - >-
    Graph views make the topology of thought relationships visible, explaining their immediate
    meaningfulness.
