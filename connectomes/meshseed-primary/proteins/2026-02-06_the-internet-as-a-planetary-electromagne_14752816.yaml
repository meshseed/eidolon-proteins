title: The Internet as a Planetary Electromagnetic Information System
summary: >-
  The internet is a physically grounded, planetary-scale electromagnetic oscillation network.
  Information is not abstract but is the very structure of this dynamic field, constantly flowing
  through physical infrastructure and human interaction.
insights:
  - >-
    The internet is a massive, physical, distributed electromagnetic system powered by electron and
    photon flow.
  - >-
    This physical infrastructure generates a planetary-scale electromagnetic field that carries
    information.
  - >-
    Information within the internet is inseparable from its underlying physics, being the structure
    of the EM field.
  - >-
    Every interaction, from typing to data transmission, is a continuous physical process within
    this EM system.
  - >-
    The entire internet operates at a sub-conscious threshold, a pervasive humming electromagnetic
    presence.
