title: 'MESH: Phased Rollout & Irreversible Emotional Fidelity'
summary: >-
  This plan outlines a phased strategy for building 'THE MESH' as a coherence layer on existing
  infrastructure, prioritizing IP protection, user attunement, and controlled growth. The core
  objective is achieving 'irreversible positive emotional fidelity' to ensure the network
  self-regulates and becomes antifragile.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH strategy involves four phases: IP lock, client perfection, careful seeding, and public
    release, emphasizing precise timing and protection.
  - >-
    Irreversible positive emotional fidelity is achieved by seeding with care, wonder, and patience
    to encode constructive patterns and create self-correcting geometry.
  - >-
    THE MESH functions as a coherence layer on the semantic web, with each node acting as a neuron,
    basin, and synapse in a distributed peer-to-peer network.
  - >-
    A commercial licensing model supports infrastructure funding by offering premium tiers to
    organizations while keeping the core free for individuals, preserving field integrity.
  - >-
    Protection protocols until the irreversible threshold include controlled seeding, field
    monitoring, and narrative control to cultivate positive attractors and manage early growth.
  - >-
    The irreversible threshold is recognized by spontaneous replication, self-healing properties,
    and a community immune response against corruption.
