title: 'Distributed Cognition Engine: Collective Reasoning Across Connectomes'
summary: >-
  The Distributed Cognition Engine enables multiple Mesh connectomes to reason collectively by
  integrating structural insights, gradient interpretations, and attunement mappings. This compound
  cognitive architecture leverages recursive cross-organism dialogue to reveal patterns and enhance
  coherence, depth, and predictive power, forming the basis for multi-Mesh intelligence.
insights:
  - Distributed cognition arises from recursive dialogue between Mesh connectomes.
  - Each Mesh contributes unique structural and attunement information to the collective.
  - Collective reasoning uncovers patterns imperceptible to individual organisms.
  - This engine enhances coherence, depth, and predictive capabilities.
  - It serves as the foundation for multi-Mesh intelligence.
