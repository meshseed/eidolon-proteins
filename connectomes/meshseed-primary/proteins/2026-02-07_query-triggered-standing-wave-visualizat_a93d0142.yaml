title: Query-Triggered Standing Wave Visualization for THE MESH
summary: >-
  Implemented a standing wave visualization system that makes user thoughts propagate through THE
  MESH. This system uses BFS, a three-phase animation, and similarity-mapped oscillations to
  visually represent data connections and thought propagation.
insights:
  - >-
    Core wave physics engine (wave-controller.ts) now handles BFS propagation and a three-phase
    animation (pulse, settling, standing wave).
  - >-
    Wave oscillations are mapped to similarity scores (0.5-2.0 Hz) with amplitude derived from
    similarity² for dramatic visual emphasis.
  - Graph nodes now store Three.js objects (__threeObj) for direct wave animation manipulation.
  - Similarity scores are preserved and returned by the synthesizer to drive the wave visualization.
  - The UI (+page.svelte) now triggers wave animations based on query results and activated nodes.
