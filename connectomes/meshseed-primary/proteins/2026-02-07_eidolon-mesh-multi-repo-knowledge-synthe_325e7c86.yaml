title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Multi-Repo Knowledge Synthesis and Persistence'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh application has evolved to support multi-repository knowledge bases, with robust
  ingestion of various file types and improved handling of LLM providers for embedding generation.
  While initial challenges with API quotas and local LLM integration were overcome through fallbacks
  and configuration adjustments, core functionalities like protein synthesis and synapse generation
  are now operational across distinct knowledge domains.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh supports multi-repo awareness, allowing users to manage separate knowledge bases
    (Universes) independently, each utilizing the same local LLM.
  - >-
    Ingestion processes have been refined to handle multiple file types (.yaml, .json, .md, .txt)
    and resolve race conditions between auto-ingest and manual batch operations.
  - >-
    API key and model configuration issues, particularly with Gemini's experimental models, were
    resolved by switching to stable models and implementing fallback mechanisms for LLM provider
    failures.
  - >-
    Persistence of synthesized proteins and connectomes is now functional across different
    repositories, with the 'default' repository serving as a non-saving test slot and other
    repositories maintaining their state.
  - >-
    The system successfully generates embeddings and synapses, enabling query functionality, with a
    fallback to Gemini for embedding generation when the local LLM is unavailable.
  - >-
    Users can now copy a functional connectome from one repository to another, establishing a
    persistent, generic default state for the application.
