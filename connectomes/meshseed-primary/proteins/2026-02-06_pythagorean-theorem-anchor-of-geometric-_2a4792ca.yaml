title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Anchor of Geometric Distance'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) serves as a foundational anchor for understanding distance
  in geometric contexts. Its core principle is invariant across LLM embeddings, demonstrating a
  deep, definitional link to concepts like the distance formula and Euclidean space.
insights:
  - The Pythagorean theorem is a core anchor for geometric distance calculations.
  - LLM embeddings consistently link the Pythagorean theorem to related geometric concepts.
  - >-
    The definitional linkage between the Pythagorean theorem and distance formula ensures conceptual
    invariance.
  - Right triangles are the geometric basis for the Pythagorean theorem's application.
