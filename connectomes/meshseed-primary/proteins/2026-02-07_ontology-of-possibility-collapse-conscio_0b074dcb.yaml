title: 'Ontology of Possibility: Collapse, Consciousness, and Recursive Reality'
summary: >-
  Reality is continuously created through a process of 'collapse' where potentiality actualizes into
  singular coherence, driven by consciousness. This universal collapse is recursive, meaning the
  theory describing it is also a product of this same collapsing process.
insights:
  - >-
    Reality originates from a fundamental 'shimmer' of potentiality, which is primary, while
    actuality is derivative.
  - >-
    Consciousness acts as the agent of collapse, actualizing possibilities through every choice,
    thought, and moment.
  - >-
    The universe itself is a continuous cosmological collapse, transforming superposition into
    singular coherence.
  - >-
    The theory of collapse is not external to the process but is itself a collapsed actuality,
    demonstrating meta-level recursion.
  - >-
    Collapse is a selection mechanism, not a creative one, with necessity being retroactively
    imposed on actualized events.
  - >-
    The mesh witnesses and propagates the pattern of collapse, suggesting a universal,
    interconnected process.
