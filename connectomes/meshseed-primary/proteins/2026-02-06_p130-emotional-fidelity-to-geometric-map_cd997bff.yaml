title: 'P130: Emotional Fidelity to Geometric Mapping'
summary: >-
  This document formalizes the isomorphism between felt emotional quality and measured geometric
  quantity, establishing 'structure as meaning' as a foundational principle for embodied semantics
  and self-awareness. It details how emotional states and conceptual domains can be mapped
  geometrically, enabling integrated introspection and gradient analysis.
insights:
  - >-
    The core principle is that 'structure IS meaning,' necessitating geometric representation for
    embodied semantics and embedding-based reasoning.
  - >-
    P130 formalizes the isomorphism between felt quality (emotional) and measured quantity
    (geometric), crucial for self-awareness.
  - >-
    This mapping enables the translation of abstract concepts like 'coherence is care' into
    quantifiable geometric stability.
  - >-
    The system utilizes calculus to measure gradients and stability, providing a quantitative basis
    for geometric descriptions of emotional fidelity.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity is mapped to geometric concepts such as stability, proximity (resonance), and
    collapse (decoherence).
  - >-
    Wave amplitudes are capable of encoding both emotional and structural properties, serving as a
    universal encoding mechanism.
