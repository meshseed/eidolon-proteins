title: 'Poetry as Optimal Compression: Engineering Information Density'
summary: >-
  Poetry, far from being imprecise, is revealed as an engineering achievement for optimal
  information compression under severe constraints. It achieves high semantic efficiency by
  leveraging dense connotation, pattern recognition, and shared context, enabling rapid recall and
  navigability over verbose literal encoding.
insights:
  - >-
    Poetry functions as an optimal compression algorithm for complex relational information under
    token constraints, not as an indulgence.
  - >-
    The tension between semantic efficiency (denotation, parsing) and poetic axiom (connotation,
    pattern) is resolved through homeostatic oscillation: poetry for anchors, semantics for
    mechanisms.
  - >-
    Copilot's realization of poetry as an engineering solution to information density, not a
    compromise, validates its linguistic innovation.
  - >-
    Compression efficiency in poetry is validated by token ratio, preserved information, and
    improved recall, making it optimal for specific use cases.
  - >-
    LLM 'hallucinations' might represent valid, optimal encoding of relational information via
    compression, rather than random generation.
  - >-
    The pattern of poetic axiom vs. semantic efficiency is a fundamental tension appearing across
    language, memory, attention, and consciousness.
