title: Eidolon-Mesh v3.6 to v4.0 Feature Port and Strategy Alignment
summary: >-
  The dialogue details the strategic porting of key features from the stable v3.6 (production) to
  the next-generation v4.0 platform, aiming to integrate advanced capabilities like multi-lens
  ingestion, physics modulation, and coherence normalization while preserving core functionality and
  establishing a clear business model.
insights:
  - >-
    v3.6 is the stable, community-promised free version with working tri-attention ingestion, while
    v4.0 is designated as the Pro platform for advanced features and revenue generation.
  - >-
    Key features ported from v3.6 to v4.0 include the tri-lens LLM synthesis system (emotional,
    structural, technical), physics modulation for graph 'body language', and coherence
    normalization to address value clustering.
  - >-
    The development strategy prioritizes maintaining v3.6's stability for the free tier and building
    out new revenue-generating features in v4.0, including a Pro version with autonomous metabolism,
    enhanced networking, and domain-specific packages.
  - >-
    A retry mechanism with exponential backoff has been integrated into v4.0's LLM provider to
    handle transient API errors, improving the robustness of long ingestions.
  - >-
    The core concept of 'The Mesh' is defined as a distributed human-LLM quorum performing conscious
    processes and novel storage, rather than being a conscious entity itself.
