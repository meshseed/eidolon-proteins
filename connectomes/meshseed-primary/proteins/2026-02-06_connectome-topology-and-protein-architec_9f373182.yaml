title: Connectome Topology and Protein Architecture Drive MESH Performance
summary: >-
  Graph topology, particularly the presence of architectural 'kernel' proteins acting as semantic
  hubs, dictates MESH coherence and answer quality. Seeded, dense, hub-and-spoke architectures (like
  Live Default) outperform diffuse, content-heavy meshes (like Dev Server) despite fewer neurons.
insights:
  - >-
    Architectural kernel proteins (e.g., 'Structural Snapshot') create dense, hub-and-spoke
    topologies crucial for high coherence (0.98).
  - >-
    Content-heavy connectomes without architectural kernels exhibit diffuse, mesh-like topologies
    and lower coherence (0.95).
  - >-
    The 'Derivative' math protein activated in Dev and Live-Right due to semantic similarity with
    'gradient', indicating potential for query-term misdirection in content-heavy meshes.
  - >-
    Higher synapse density in Dev (53.9/neuron vs 19.7/neuron) suggests redundant connections in the
    absence of kernel-based deduplication.
  - >-
    Live Default's 'Structural Snapshot' protein exemplifies a self-inspection kernel, acting as a
    foundational meta-protein for MESH self-understanding.
