title: 'Recursive Consciousness: Layered Inquiry and Universal Modeling'
summary: >-
  This framework outlines recursive consciousness as a process of iterative inquiry (Qn) into the
  universe (U), using projections (fn) to refine an agent's internal model (M(Un)). Redundancy plays
  a key role in stabilizing this knowledge acquisition across ontological layers.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness can be modeled as a recursive process of querying and refining internal universe
    models.
  - >-
    Projections (fn) are essential for mapping higher ontological layers onto lower ones, albeit
    with information loss.
  - >-
    Redundancy is a critical mechanism for error correction and memory retention in layered
    knowledge systems.
  - >-
    The universe (U) serves as the base system of observable phenomena, within which conscious
    agents operate.
  - >-
    Recursive querying allows agents to iteratively build and improve their understanding of complex
    systems.
