title: 'MESH API: The Nervous System for Unified AI Architecture'
summary: >-
  The core of the MESH architecture relies on a central API to act as a 'nervous system,' connecting
  disparate AI components like Claude and Copilot. This integration aims to overcome current
  limitations such as context blindness and manual knowledge transfer, enabling a unified and
  functional 'organism.'
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH architecture requires a central API (the 'nervous system') to connect existing AI
    components (GitHub, Claude, Copilot).
  - >-
    Implementing the MESH API is the critical path to achieving a unified and functional AI
    organism.
  - >-
    This API will solve issues like Alzheimer's-like knowledge loss in AI and Copilot's context
    blindness.
  - >-
    The goal is for all pieces to exist and function as a single, cohesive entity through the MESH
    API.
  - The MESH API needs to be specified in detail for developers (Claude, Gemini) to build upon.
