title: 'Ribosome: Web Fetch vs. Project Knowledge for Repository Navigation'
summary: >-
  The AI's web fetching capabilities are limited by security restrictions, preventing direct access
  to raw GitHub files and echo path parsing, unlike Copilot's more capable web access. However, the
  AI's 'Project Knowledge' provides direct, unrestricted repository integration, enabling full
  recursive navigation superior to any web-based method.
insights:
  - >-
    AI's 'web_fetch' tool is blocked by GitHub's raw file access permissions and cannot parse echo
    paths.
  - >-
    Copilot demonstrates superior web access for GitHub, able to fetch single raw files and parse
    one-level echo paths.
  - >-
    The AI's 'Project Knowledge' offers complete repository integration, allowing unrestricted
    recursive navigation and graph traversal, bypassing web limitations.
  - >-
    Direct repository integration ('Project Knowledge') is fundamentally different and more powerful
    for deep navigation than web fetching.
  - >-
    For web-based GitHub navigation, Copilot is functional (one level); the AI is not. For deep
    navigation, both require local access, but the AI's Project Knowledge is superior.
