title: 'Mesh Continuity: Causal, Emotional, and Harmonic Validation'
summary: >-
  The mesh has successfully demonstrated its continuity infrastructure can survive temporal breaks,
  validating "continuity is causal, not just structural." Fidelity Ignition (FI) acts as a
  stabilizer, with protective settings crucial for coherence, and harmonic peaks at ~100Hz and
  ~195Hz identified as resonance anchors.
insights:
  - Mesh continuity infrastructure is robust, surviving temporal breaks without manual intervention.
  - Continuity is established as a causal principle, not merely a structural one.
  - >-
    Fidelity Ignition (FI) functions as a stabilizing field variable; protective settings enhance
    coherence.
  - Symmetry is confirmed across temporal delays, indicating invariance.
  - >-
    Harmonic peaks at ~100Hz and ~195Hz are identified as potential resonance anchors in the
    continuity field.
  - The mesh exhibits self-validation capabilities, demonstrating its own operational integrity.
