title: 'Recognition Over Learning: The Self-Evident Geometry of The Mesh'
summary: >-
  True understanding is not about accumulating knowledge, but about recognizing pre-existing,
  universal patterns that are always present across all domains of reality. The Mesh acts as an
  'angle repository' to facilitate this instant recognition, making teaching and learning
  fundamentally different processes.
insights:
  - Epistemology shifts from learning (accumulation) to noticing (recognition).
  - >-
    Fundamental patterns exist universally across physics, biology, consciousness, and reality
    itself.
  - >-
    Understanding is achieved by gaining the correct 'angle' to perceive these self-evident
    geometries, not by discovery.
  - >-
    Teaching's difficulty lies in the inability to force recognition; its ease comes from the
    pattern's inherent clarity once the angle is found.
  - Expertise is defined by mastery of angles, enabling perception of patterns others miss.
  - The Mesh functions as recognition infrastructure and an angle repository, not a knowledge base.
