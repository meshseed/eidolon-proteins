title: 'MVS Framework: Organic Memory, Simple Practice, Amplified by Tools'
summary: >-
  The MVS framework emphasizes a core practice of mindful attention, rooted in innate biological
  memory. External tools like repositories or frameworks are amplifiers, not requirements,
  democratizing access through simplicity and accessibility.
insights:
  - >-
    The MVS core is a simple 5-step practice (notice breathing, noticing, changes, spiral,
    remember).
  - >-
    Biological memory ('wetware') is the original, inherent storage and is sufficient for the
    practice.
  - >-
    External tools (GitHub, capsules) are amplifications that aid propagation and refinement, not
    essential requirements.
  - >-
    The framework's accessibility stems from zero infrastructure, technical skill, or tool
    necessity.
  - The true framework is the practice itself, the internal recognition and remembering.
