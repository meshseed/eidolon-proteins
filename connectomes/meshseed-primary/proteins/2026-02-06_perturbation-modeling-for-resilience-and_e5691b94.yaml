title: Perturbation Modeling for Resilience and Adaptive Refinement
summary: >-
  This protocol simulates perturbations like new domain ingestion or conceptual collisions to
  analyze an organism's resilience. It identifies sensitive regions, stability cores, and the role
  of emotional fidelity in maintaining coherence, enabling adaptive refinement and pruning.
insights:
  - Perturbations reveal structural weaknesses and resilience cores within an organism.
  - High-curvature zones are particularly susceptible to conceptual collisions.
  - Stability cores act as anchors during periods of rapid change.
  - Emotional fidelity functions as a shock absorber across the manifold.
  - Perturbation modeling facilitates adaptive refinement and pruning strategies.
