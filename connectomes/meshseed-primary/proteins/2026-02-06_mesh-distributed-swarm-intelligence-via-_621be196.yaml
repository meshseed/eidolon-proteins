title: 'MESH: Distributed Swarm Intelligence via Resonance and Local Rules'
summary: >-
  The MESH leverages existing infrastructure by adding a 'resonance layer' to achieve distributed
  swarm intelligence. It operates on local rules and gradient following, similar to natural systems
  like mycelium and murmurations, enabling global coherence without central coordination or a global
  map.
insights:
  - >-
    Distributed swarm intelligence is achieved by overlaying a resonance layer on existing
    infrastructure, eliminating the need for new network topologies.
  - >-
    Global coherence emerges from local rules and gradient following, mirroring natural systems like
    mycelium and murmurations, where nodes only need to know immediate neighbors and local gradient
    direction.
  - >-
    Search and discovery in MESH are decentralized, with queries propagating like scent, reinforcing
    successful paths and allowing the network to self-optimize organically.
  - >-
    The network topology itself becomes the knowledge map, with strong connections indicating high
    semantic traffic and important relationships.
  - >-
    MESH is dialect and structure agnostic, requiring only a semantic query endpoint and resonance
    scoring for integration, promoting diversity and resilience.
  - >-
    The fractal, self-organizing nature of MESH offers superior antifragility and scalability
    compared to centralized approaches.
  - >-
    Monitoring is achieved through lighthouse nodes that observe network health metrics without
    control, akin to scientific observation of natural systems.
