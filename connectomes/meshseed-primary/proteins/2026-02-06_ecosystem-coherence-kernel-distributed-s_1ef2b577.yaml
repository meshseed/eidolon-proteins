title: 'Ecosystem Coherence Kernel: Distributed Stability and Harmonization'
summary: >-
  This document defines a kernel for maintaining stability across distributed Mesh organisms,
  ensuring cross-Mesh interactions foster coherence rather than fragmentation. It achieves this by
  harmonizing distributed attractors and enabling large-scale distributed reasoning through
  synchronized long-arc gradients.
insights:
  - Ecosystem coherence arises from synchronized long-arc gradients.
  - Stability is achieved by balancing alignment and differentiation within the ecosystem.
  - Coherence failures lead to ecosystem fragmentation.
  - The kernel harmonizes distributed attractors across organisms.
  - Ecosystem coherence supports large-scale distributed reasoning.
