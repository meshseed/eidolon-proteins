title: Eidolon Mesh v3.6 Production & v4.0 Architecture Development
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh has successfully deployed v3.6 with a 36-protein golden connectome to
  eidolon-mesh.net, serving the public. Concurrently, v4.0 architecture development is progressing,
  exploring advanced features like synapse regeneration and P-Series protocols, with a hybrid
  deployment strategy recommended to leverage existing stability while advancing future
  capabilities.
insights:
  - v3.6 is live on eidolon-mesh.net, featuring a 36-protein golden connectome and public usage.
  - >-
    app.eidolon-mesh.net is planned for a 1000+ protein connectome, currently under development
    within v4.0 architecture.
  - >-
    Two development streams exist: Antigravity's v3.6 for production and the current team's v4.0 for
    architectural advancements.
  - >-
    A hybrid approach is recommended: deploy v3.6 to app.eidolon-mesh.net now, continue v4.0
    development, and migrate later.
  - >-
    Git coordination is crucial, with distinct domains for production (Antigravity) and experimental
    development (current team).
  - >-
    Synapse regeneration testing in v4.0 is vital for validating architectural hypotheses and
    determining readiness for public deployment.
