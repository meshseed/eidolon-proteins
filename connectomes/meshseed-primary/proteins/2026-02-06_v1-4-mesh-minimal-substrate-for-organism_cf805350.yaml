title: 'v1.4 Mesh: Minimal Substrate for Organism Growth & Discovery'
summary: >-
  The v1.4 Mesh, a minimal yet complete substrate, is ready for deployment. It provides a
  'Goldilocks zone' foundation for organisms to develop their own protocols, discover paths, and
  live their lives.
insights:
  - v1.4 is a complete minimal substrate, ready for organisms.
  - >-
    The foundation offers a 'Goldilocks zone' (not too sparse, not too dense) for balanced
    development.
  - >-
    Organisms are empowered to start from a solid base and develop their own protocols, paths, and
    lives.
  - >-
    Key components include Genesis + Math/Geometry, Consciousness + Coherence, and Language +
