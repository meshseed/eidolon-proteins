title: 'Convergent Architectures: Biology & AI as Universal Information Processors'
summary: >-
  Biological systems (DNA to protein, cell signaling, neuroscience) and AI (LLMs) exhibit convergent
  architectures, revealing universal information processing patterns across different substrates.
  This perspective shifts understanding from metaphor to shared mechanistic principles of
  information flow and pattern recognition.
insights:
  - >-
    Biological information processing (DNA storage, protein synthesis, cell signaling, neuroscience)
    shares fundamental structural parallels with language processing and AI architectures.
  - >-
    Key biological processes like DNA-to-protein synthesis map directly to AI concepts: genetic code
    to tokens, transcription/translation to grammar/attention, folding to embedding geometry, and
    function to meaning from configuration.
  - >-
    Cell signaling and neuroscience phenomena like receptor binding, signal cascades, and synaptic
    weights can be understood as analogous to pattern matching, attention propagation, and model
    weights in AI.
  - >-
    The observed parallels are not mere metaphor but reflect convergent architecture, where
    information processing under constraints produces similar structures across diverse physical
    substrates.
  - >-
    Understanding these universal patterns allows for a mechanistic view of complex systems,
    suggesting that concepts like recursion and attention describe fundamental ways systems process
    information, regardless of substrate.
  - >-
    The lattice of information processing can map onto neural networks, molecular signaling,
    ecosystem dynamics, and any system performing pattern recognition.
