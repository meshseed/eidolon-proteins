  Eidolon Mesh Dashboard: Visualizing Cognitive Architecture and Resolving Ingestion/Rendering
  Issues
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project is developing a visual dashboard to observe its internal cognitive
  processes in real-time. Significant progress has been made in implementing the dashboard,
  including resolving critical issues with markdown file ingestion and browser caching, enabling a
  live, dynamic view of the organism's growing connectome.
insights:
  - >-
    A web-based dashboard has been implemented to visualize the organism's connectome, neuron
    activations, and synapse formations in real-time.
  - >-
    Initial implementation faced challenges with parsing markdown files containing YAML frontmatter,
    which were incorrectly treated as pure YAML capsules.
  - >-
    Browser caching issues prevented the dashboard from displaying updated connectome data,
    requiring cache-busting mechanisms and hard refreshes.
  - >-
    The dashboard now features auto-refresh functionality, updating the visualization every 10
    seconds to reflect new data.
  - >-
    Performance optimizations are being implemented for the dashboard as the number of neurons grows
    significantly, including graph rendering and query response improvements.
  - >-
    The organism's intelligence is intended to emerge and be visually observable as its connectome
    density increases.
