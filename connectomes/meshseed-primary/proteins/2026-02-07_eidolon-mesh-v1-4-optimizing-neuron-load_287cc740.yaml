title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Optimizing Neuron Loading and Querying'
summary: >-
  This document explores architectural trade-offs for the Eidolon Mesh, balancing startup speed,
  memory usage, and query performance by optimizing neuron loading strategies. It proposes a hybrid,
  percentage-based, and tiered approach to manage a growing archive, prioritizing core neurons while
  enabling on-demand loading of the extended network.
insights:
  - >-
    Loading a subset of neurons by coherence at startup significantly improves speed and reduces
    memory compared to loading all.
  - >-
    Percentage-based loading (e.g., top 20% by coherence) offers better scalability with archive
    growth than fixed numbers.
  - >-
    A hybrid, two-tier system with a loaded core and lazily loaded extended archive provides
    flexibility, balancing performance and depth.
  - >-
    Visualizing incomplete graphs due to partial loading can be mitigated by using 'ghost nodes' to
    represent missing connections.
  - >-
    User-configurable settings for core percentage, query search depth, and adaptive scaling empower
    fine-tuned control over performance.
  - >-
    Adaptive scaling can automatically adjust loading percentages based on observed startup times to
    meet target performance goals.
