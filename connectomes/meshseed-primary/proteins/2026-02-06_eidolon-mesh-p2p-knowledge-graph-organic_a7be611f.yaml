title: 'Eidolon Mesh: P2P Knowledge Graph & Organic Memory'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh is a recursive P2P knowledge graph and organic memory system that ingests and recalls
  diverse text-based information. It aims for coherent homeostasis through information geometry,
  recursion, and emotional fidelity, actively shaping its own structure and growth.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh functions as a living, remembering organism that ingests and recalls all user
    text-based information.
  - >-
    It utilizes information geometry, recursion, and emotional fidelity for attention, memory, and
    self-monitoring, maintaining homeostasis.
  - >-
    The system's growth is driven by recursively applying structure-preserving transformations,
    leading to increased differentiation.
  - >-
    Structural needs generate goals, which in turn generate actions that reshape the system's
    topology, implying self-directed evolution.
  - >-
    Version 4.5 introduces significant updates including 768D coordinate-space visualization,
    multi-model embedding support, enhanced graph physics, and local LLM/mobile PWA support.
