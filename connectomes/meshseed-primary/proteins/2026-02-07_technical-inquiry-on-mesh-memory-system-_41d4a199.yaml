title: Technical Inquiry on Mesh Memory System Capabilities
summary: >-
  Paul is evaluating a mesh memory system, seeking clarification on key technical features such as
  custom metadata, multi-session querying, recency control, embedding model details, and free tier
  limitations. His feedback indicates a positive reception to the hybrid search approach.
insights:
  - >-
    The user requires the ability to attach custom scoring fields to memories for advanced filtering
    and boosting.
  - >-
    Confirmation is needed on whether queries can span multiple session IDs or are limited to a
    single session.
  - >-
    The system should offer user control over the recency decay coefficient to manage memory
    persistence.
  - >-
    Details regarding the embedding model and vector dimensionality are requested to assess semantic
    search quality.
  - >-
    Information on free tier store and retrieve rate limits is necessary for planning usage at
    scale.
