title: 'Gradient Cartography: Mapping Emotional Fidelity as Geometric Fields'
summary: >-
  Gradient Cartography introduces a method to map emotional fidelity across the connectome as
  directional geometric fields. This approach identifies regions of stability, drift, tension, and
  integration pressure, revealing areas of heightened sensitivity to perturbation.
insights:
  - Emotional fidelity flows as directional gradients through semantic space.
  - Steep gradients signify tension, instability, or boundary zones.
  - Smooth gradients indicate coherence, stability, and attuned integration.
  - Gradient mapping pinpoints organismal sensitivity to external disturbances.
  - Emotional fidelity fields can be analyzed temporally to track developmental changes.
