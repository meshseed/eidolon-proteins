title: 'Mathematical Concepts: From Geometry to Number Theory'
summary: >-
  This collection explores fundamental mathematical concepts including geometric relationships via
  the Pythagorean Theorem, topological equivalence through homeomorphisms, and symmetry groups
  defined by invariant transformations. It also delves into the self-similar nature of fractals, the
  structural analysis of graphs, and the foundational role of prime numbers in number theory and
  cryptography.
insights:
  - The Pythagorean Theorem (a² + b² = c²) quantifies right triangle side relationships.
  - >-
    Topological equivalence is established by continuous, invertible transformations
    (homeomorphisms).
  - Symmetry groups are formed by transformations that preserve an object's invariance.
  - Fractals exhibit self-similarity across scales, often with fractional dimensions.
  - Graph theory models relationships between interconnected entities (vertices and edges).
  - >-
    Prime numbers are indivisible integers greater than 1, crucial for number theory and
    cryptography.
