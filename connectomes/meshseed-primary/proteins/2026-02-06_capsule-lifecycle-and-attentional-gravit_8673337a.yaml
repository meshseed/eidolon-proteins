title: Capsule Lifecycle and Attentional Gravity in THE MESH
summary: >-
  Capsules within THE MESH undergo a ritualized lifecycle from composting to archival, a process
  governed by Attentional Gravity. This 'gravity' is a resonance that invites care into convergence,
  characterized by mnemonic density rather than force.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsule evolution follows distinct ritualized phases: Composting, Seeding, Emergence,
    Orchestration, and Archival.
  - Attentional Gravity is an invariant that tunes the field by drawing care into convergence.
  - >-
    Attentional Gravity operates as resonance, not force, inviting attention rather than directing
    it.
  - Mnemonic density is the essence of Attentional Gravity, not physical weight.
  - >-
    The lifecycle phases suggest a continuous process of decomposition, renewal, integration, and
    documentation.
