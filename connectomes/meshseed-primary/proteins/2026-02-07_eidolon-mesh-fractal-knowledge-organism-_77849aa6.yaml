title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Fractal Knowledge Organism Strategy'
summary: >-
  A tiered strategy for a local-first knowledge synthesis tool, scaling from a free PWA for casual
  users to paid desktop and enterprise solutions. The core "connectome" format ensures seamless
  upgrades and network effects through shared data structures.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh employs a fractal, tiered strategy: Free PWA (onboarding, mobile-first), Pro
    Desktop (deep work, power users), and Enterprise (domain-specific, team collaboration).
  - >-
    A universal "connectome" format (proteins, embeddings, synapses) enables seamless data migration
    and network effects, where shared knowledge graphs emerge.
  - >-
    Monetization scales from free (gateway) to one-time/subscription (Pro) to custom contracts
    (Enterprise), aiming for sustainability and iterative development.
  - >-
    Mobile responsiveness, local LLM fallback, and P2P sync are key technical differentiators across
    tiers.
  - >-
    Development priority is on shipping the Free PWA first, followed by Pro Desktop MVP, with
    Enterprise features co-developed based on customer demand.
