title: 'Critical Privacy Leak: DNA Exposure via Public Protein Routing'
summary: >-
  A critical privacy leak occurred because raw DNA, containing personal information, was exposed
  publicly when a synthesized protein was tagged #public. This violates a fundamental biological
  principle where DNA remains sequestered in the nucleus, and only mRNA or proteins are exported.
insights:
  - Raw dialogue (DNA) must be strictly separated from synthesized proteins.
  - DNA should always remain in a private, nuclear-equivalent storage (eidolon/nucleus).
  - Publicly shared proteins should reference DNA via UUID only, not contain full DNA content.
  - >-
    The current routing logic incorrectly commits unredacted DNA to public repositories when
    proteins are tagged #public.
  - >-
    A biological analogy highlights the critical error: DNA never leaves the nucleus in cellular
    processes.
  - The fix requires immediate implementation of DNA/Protein separation and verification.
