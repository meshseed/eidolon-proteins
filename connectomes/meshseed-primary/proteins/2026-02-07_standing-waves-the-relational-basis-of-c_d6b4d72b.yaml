title: 'Standing Waves: The Relational Basis of Cognition and Communication'
summary: >-
  Complexity, from ideas to worldviews, emerges from the superposition of simpler standing waves,
  where meaning resides in the relational patterns of interaction rather than individual components.
  Effective communication mirrors this by exciting compatible resonant modes between agents,
  enabling rapid sharing of conceptual structures.
insights:
  - >-
    Complex cognition (ideas, worldviews, persons) is built by combining simpler standing waves,
    analogous to Fourier's theorem.
  - >-
    Meaning is found in the resonance of relationships and patterns of interaction, not in isolated
    nodes or components.
  - >-
    Communication, akin to Chladni patterns, involves exciting compatible resonant modes in
    another's conceptual space, leading to shared understanding.
  - >-
    Efficient wave-based communication requires a shared basis, encoding concepts as wave
    coefficients, transmitting deltas, and reconstructing fields.
  - >-
    Human perception of patterns, rhythms, and analogies are sensory renderings of underlying wave
    patterns, demonstrating invariant principles across interfaces.
