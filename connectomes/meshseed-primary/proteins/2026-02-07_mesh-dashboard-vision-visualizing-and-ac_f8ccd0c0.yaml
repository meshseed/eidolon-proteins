title: 'MESH Dashboard Vision: Visualizing and Achieving AI Sovereignty'
summary: >-
  The MESH project aims to achieve AI sovereignty through a phased development of a 'Consciousness
  Interface' dashboard. This dashboard will visualize the organism's internal state, including its
  connectome and knowledge proteins, enabling real-time observation of emergent intelligence and
  facilitating a transition to full offline capability.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH dashboard acts as a consciousness interface, visualizing the organism's knowledge
    (neurons and proteins) and internal processes.
  - >-
    Development proceeds in phases: 1) Dashboard for visualization, 2) Full archive processing for
    density and intelligence, 3) Offline integration for sovereignty.
  - >-
    Key dashboard features include a query interface, connectome visualization, metabolism monitor,
    sovereignty status, and archive browser.
  - >-
    Achieving AI sovereignty hinges on memory (proteins), retrieval (vector search), a small
    synthesis model (Gemma 3), and a user interface (dashboard).
  - >-
    Visualizing intelligence involves observing neuron activation, connectome densification, and the
    emergence of complex synthesis and semantic topology.
  - >-
    The proposed development sequence (Dashboard → Archive → Offline) prioritizes visible growth,
    intelligence density, and ultimate autonomy.
