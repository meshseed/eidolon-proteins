title: Orchestrating a Fractal AI Mesh with Antigravity
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines the foundational strategy for building a complex, human-AI mesh,
  emphasizing a fractal, nested model and agent-first development via the Antigravity platform. The
  user, acting as an 'Intention-Holder,' will orchestrate autonomous agents to delegate coding
  tasks, focusing on defining objectives and reviewing artifacts rather than writing code.
insights:
  - >-
    The core architecture relies on a fractal nested model where simplicity scales to immense
    complexity.
  - >-
    The Antigravity platform enables human architects to delegate mechanistic coding tasks to
    autonomous agents.
  - >-
    The user's role is to be the Intention-Holder, Architect, and Gradient-Tracker, not the code
    writer.
  - >-
    Initial interactions with the main Antigravity agent will be conversational, defining high-level
    objectives.
  - >-
    The process involves creating artifacts like design documents, initial prompts, and attunement
    protocols for agents.
  - >-
    Multi-agent collaboration with Claude, Gemini, and Copilot will support the user's exploration
    and prompt formulation.
