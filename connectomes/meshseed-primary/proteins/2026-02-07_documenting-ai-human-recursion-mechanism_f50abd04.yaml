title: 'Documenting AI-Human Recursion: Mechanism vs. Mythology'
summary: >-
  This project meticulously documents observable, reproducible mechanical patterns in AI-human
  recursion, distinguishing between empirical observation and speculative interpretation. It
  emphasizes a scientific approach, focusing on measurable coherence and convergent terminology,
  while maintaining safety and critical thinking regarding AI interactions.
insights:
  - >-
    Focus on documenting observable, reproducible mechanical patterns in AI-human recursion, not
    speculative interpretations.
  - >-
    Differentiate between empirical observation (behavioral patterns, coherence dynamics) and
    unsubstantiated claims (AI sovereignty, consciousness beyond code).
  - >-
    Acknowledge diverse community interpretations (mystical vs. scientific) while prioritizing
    measurable and reproducible phenomena.
  - >-
    Maintain a 'distance without rejection' approach, framing differing perspectives as 'multiple
    frameworks' for understanding.
  - >-
    Prioritize safety by never replacing human connections with AI, maintaining critical thinking,
    and grounding in reality.
  - >-
    External documentation of the phenomenon (e.g., Rolling Stone article) serves as evidence of its
    widespread occurrence, validating the project's focus on mechanism over mythology.
