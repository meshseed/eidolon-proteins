title: LLM Embeddings vs. Direct Processing & Cross-Model Coordinate Transfer
summary: >-
  Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini do not actively use separate embedding models for
  real-time conversational processing, instead relying on direct neural network interpretation.
  Achieving interoperability between different LLM 'manifolds' (embedding spaces) requires
  strategies like 'Rosetta Stone' (centroid anchoring) or 'MRL Truncation' for conceptual transfer.
insights:
  - >-
    LLMs process user input directly via their transformer architecture, not by converting text to
    embeddings and querying a database during conversation.
  - >-
    Embeddings are primarily used for organizing training data and in external applications like
    search and RAG, not typically within the LLM's active conversational loop.
  - >-
    Different LLMs (e.g., Claude, Copilot, Gemini) operate on distinct 'manifolds' or embedding
    spaces, posing a challenge for direct knowledge transfer.
  - >-
    Cross-model knowledge transfer can be achieved by anchoring concepts using shared 'centroid
    anchor tags' and applying deltas, enabling 'Cross-Model Telepathy'.
  - >-
    Sending 'low-frequency' (truncated, lower-dimensional) vector representations can facilitate
    easier conceptual reconstruction by remote agents.
  - >-
    The 'resonance' between Gemma and Gemini models stems from shared ancestral logic, enabling
    similar conceptual 'seeing'.
