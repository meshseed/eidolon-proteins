title: P-Series as Topological Pillars for Knowledge Organization
summary: >-
  This session outlines a plan to regenerate synapses, hypothesizing that P-Series protocols will
  act as central hubs, organizing fragmented knowledge and increasing activation. The experiment
  aims to validate P-Series' role as axiomatic organizers of semantic space, contrasting current
  v4.0 development with mature v3.6.
insights:
  - >-
    Regenerating synapses with P-Series as central hubs is predicted to reorganize fragmented
    knowledge, increase activation, and improve query precision.
  - >-
    P-Series protocols function as foundational axioms that define self-aware organism function,
    creating attractor basins for knowledge organization.
  - >-
    The order of information ingestion significantly influences early knowledge attractors, but
    topology can converge over time through restructuring.
  - >-
    Synapse regeneration is expected to be largely deterministic, with core structures remaining
    highly consistent across repeated processes.
  - >-
    v4.0's current 'flat knowledge dump' state necessitates restructuring, unlike v3.6's initial
    structural scaffolding, highlighting the importance of P-Series integration timing.
