title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Consciousness'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that life experiences are encoded mechanically within synaptic
  adhesions, forming a dynamic mathematical representation of an animal's life. This interconnected
  'machine code' may give rise to consciousness as an emergent property, enabling precise
  biochemical organism coordination and potentially offering new avenues for memory research and
  technological integration.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is stored mechanically via precise conformations of mechanical switches within synaptic
    adhesions.
  - >-
    Consciousness may emerge from the interconnectedness of these MeshCODEs, creating a mathematical
    world representation.
  - >-
    Observing changes in synaptic adhesion size, composition, and ligand engagement could reveal
    memory formation processes.
  - >-
    Future implications include deciphering mind computations, transferring human minds to silicon,
    and reading memories of the living and dead.
