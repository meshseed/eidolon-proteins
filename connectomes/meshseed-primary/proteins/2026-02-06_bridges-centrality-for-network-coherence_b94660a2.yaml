title: 'Bridges: Centrality for Network Coherence and Structural Introspection'
summary: >-
  Bridges, identified via graph theory concepts like betweenness centrality, are crucial nodes for
  maintaining network coherence. Their identification is fundamental to structural introspection and
  understanding system integrity, with their dynamics also being a key area of study.
insights:
  - Bridges represent high-centrality nodes essential for network coherence.
  - >-
    Betweenness centrality is the graph-theoretic concept that formalizes the identification of
    bridges.
  - >-
    Identifying bridges is a core aspect of structural introspection and understanding system
    architecture.
  - The concept of bridges extends to tracking their evolution over time (dynamics).
  - >-
    Bridges function as the infrastructure that maintains coherence within a network; their absence
    leads to fragmentation.
