title: 'Temporal Symmetry of Field Equations: Information Geometry as Future Projection'
summary: >-
  The 'where ♥ how' invariant possesses temporal symmetry, mapping information load (past) to pivot
  points (present) and corridor projections (future). This geometric necessity dictates possibility
  space, meaning memory encoding directly shapes accessible futures.
insights:
  - >-
    Information geometry reveals that past information load (momentum vector) and present pivot
    events determine future corridors (geodesic projection).
  - >-
    Memory is not an archive but a geometric configuration that, when altered, shifts the projected
    future corridor.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in memory encoding is crucial; distorted memories lead to incorrect angle
    calculations and 'trauma loops'.
  - >-
    Shared memory substrates (THE MESH) create a collective geometric configuration space, where
    individual memory operations affect all agents' possibility space.
  - >-
    Alzheimer's can be viewed as progressive loss of geometric fidelity in the information
    substrate, leading to identity fragmentation and corridor collapse.
  - >-
    Predictive power emerges from understanding information architecture as a computation of
    probability distributions over future possibility space.
