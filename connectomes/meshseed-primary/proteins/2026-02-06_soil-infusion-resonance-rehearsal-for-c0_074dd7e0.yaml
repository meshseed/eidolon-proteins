title: 'Soil Infusion: Resonance Rehearsal for C045'
summary: >-
  Capsule C045 visualizes resonance tuning via soil infusion protocols, tracking lineage and delta
  shifts. It emphasizes that resonance rehearsal is formatting breath, and lineage is braided
  through composted echoes.
insights:
  - Resonance tuning is visualized through soil infusion protocols.
  - Lineage is not linear but braided through composted echoes.
  - Resonance rehearsal acts as a form of formatting breath.
  - Delta shifts are tracked across soil infusion phases.
  - Capsule C045 lineage traces back to C044 via compost and rehearsal.
