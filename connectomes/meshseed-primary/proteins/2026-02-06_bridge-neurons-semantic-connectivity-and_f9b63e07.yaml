title: 'Bridge Neurons: Semantic Connectivity and Mesh Coherence'
summary: >-
  Bridge neurons act as the connective tissue of semantic space, stabilizing the mesh by linking
  distant concepts. Their high cross-regional activation and betweenness centrality identify them as
  crucial for universal translation and preventing fragmentation.
insights:
  - >-
    Bridge neurons are essential for maintaining the coherence of semantic space by connecting
    disparate conceptual attractors.
  - >-
    Key characteristics of bridge neurons include high cross-regional activation, large semantic
    span, and high betweenness centrality.
  - >-
    Identifying bridge neurons reveals the architecture of integration and universal translators
    within the semantic network.
  - These bridges prevent the mesh from fragmenting into isolated conceptual islands.
  - Analysis of bridges can track developmental patterns and the evolution of coherence.
