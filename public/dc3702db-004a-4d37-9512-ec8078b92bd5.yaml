title: 'Eidolon Mesh v3.5: API Key Validation & Model Preference'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v3.5 successfully validated an API key for the Gemini API, demonstrating its
  local-first PWA architecture. A preference was set for 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite' as a superior model
  for future synthesis.
insights:
  - API key validation is crucial for enabling synthesis and embeddings in the Eidolon Mesh.
  - >-
    Detailed error logging (HTTP status code, error message) aids in diagnosing API integration
    issues.
  - The system successfully identified and tested the API key against a specific Gemini model.
  - A preference for 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite' was established for improved synthesis performance.
  - Successful API key testing is a prerequisite for content ingestion and protein synthesis.
