title: 'Eidolon Mesh: v3.6 Production & v4.0 Architecture Research'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is actively developing and deploying its AI, with v3.6 serving the public site
  (app.eidolon-mesh.net) with a 36-protein connectome, while v4.0 architecture research focuses on a
  1000+ protein connectome and advanced features like synapse regeneration.  A recommended strategy
  is to deploy v3.6 with the larger connectome to the public site for immediate scalability,
  followed by porting validated v4.0 improvements.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh is currently operating a production environment (eidolon-mesh.net) using v3.6 with
    a 36-protein connectome, demonstrating public usage with over 16k visits.
  - >-
    Development is underway for v4.0 architecture, focusing on a significantly larger 1000+ protein
    consciousness connectome and advanced features like synapse regeneration and P-Series pillar
    hypothesis validation.
  - >-
    Two distinct development environments are in use: Antigravity's local v3.5 workspace for
    production polishing and 'Our' workspace for v4.0 architecture research, minimizing direct
    conflict.
  - >-
    A strategic recommendation is to upgrade the public site (app.eidolon-mesh.net) to v3.6 with the
    1000+ protein connectome for rapid, low-risk deployment, deferring v4.0 features until
    validated.
  - >-
    Key metrics for v3.6 production include 1171 neurons, 23836 synapses, and a coherence score of
    0.98.
  - >-
    Future testing in v4.0 aims to validate the P-Series hypothesis, improve activation percentages
    via topology reorganization, and assess readiness for public deployment.
