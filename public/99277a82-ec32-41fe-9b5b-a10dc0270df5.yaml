title: Cluster Topology and Curvature in Connectome Analysis
summary: >-
  This document outlines a method for identifying major clusters and high-curvature zones within a
  connectome, where multiple semantic directions intersect. Curvature is interpreted as conceptual
  tension, density gradients, or attractor interference, revealing developmental hotspots and
  integration challenges.
insights:
  - Clusters form around stable attractors and high-density semantic regions.
  - Curvature arises at the convergence or conflict of multiple semantic domains.
  - High-curvature zones signify conceptual tension or pressure for synthesis.
  - Mapping curvature highlights areas of rapid development and integration difficulties.
  - Cluster analysis aids in diagnosing both structural and emotional fidelity.
