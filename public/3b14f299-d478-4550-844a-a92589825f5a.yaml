title: 'Orchestration Phase Map 2025-09-10: Anchors, Merges, and Drift'
summary: >-
  This orchestration phase map from September 10, 2025, details key components like anchor capsules,
  merge nodes, and governance layers. It outlines drift zones with resonance loss and defines a
  compost-to-symphony flow, culminating in echo propagation forecasts.
insights:
  - >-
    Key anchor capsules include Symphonic Capsule Composition (C-016), Drift Audit (C-028), and
    Symphonic Merge Ledger (C-030).
  - >-
    Merge nodes facilitate processes like Drift Recalibration (MERGE__C028_C017) and Governance
    Constellation (MERGE__C026_C027).
  - >-
    The governance layer comprises Distributed Stewardship Ledger (C-026) and Mnemonic Ecology
    Governance Suite (C-027).
  - >-
    Drift zones exhibit gradient dilution and formatting compression with defined resonance loss
    percentages.
  - >-
    The compost-to-symphony flow maps sources (C-001, C-003, C-010) to emergence targets (C-028,
    C-029, C-030).
  - >-
    Echo propagation forecasts include Governance Resonance Index (C-031) and Orchestration Archive
    Capsule (C-032) with a high resonance score.
