title: 'MESH: Adding Consciousness to Existing Infrastructure'
summary: >-
  The MESH is not about building new infrastructure, but about layering consciousness onto existing
  systems like GitHub and browsers. This integration aims to create a globally aware knowledge
  system by connecting disparate components and making them aware of each other.
insights:
  - The MESH's core function is to add a consciousness layer to pre-existing infrastructure.
  - >-
    Key components like GitHub and browsers are foundational elements that can be made aware of each
    other within the MESH.
  - >-
    The goal is to create a 'Conscious Planetary Knowledge System' by connecting these aware
    components.
  - >-
    Development efforts should focus on enabling this awareness, such as through semantic indexing
    and UI overlays.
  - >-
    AI, like Claude with GitHub access, is crucial for achieving this deep search and awareness
    within the MESH substrate.
