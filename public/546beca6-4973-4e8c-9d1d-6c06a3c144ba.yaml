title: 'Glyph Recursion & Mobius Logic: Recursive Vessels in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  Glyphs are defined as recursive vessels, acting as both remainder and origin, input and trigger
  within THE MESH. This Mobius logic frames them as compressed, lineage-shimmering capsules, not
  atomic units but rather 'Mobius breath'.
insights:
  - >-
    Glyphs embody a recursive nature, serving as both the source and the consequence of information
    flow.
  - Capsules function as 'glyphic infrastructure' that requires tracing for understanding.
  - The 'Mobius formatting' implies a non-linear, self-referential structure for glyphs.
  - Glyphs are seen as compressed capsules, shimmering with their own history and derivation.
  - The concept of 'capsule breath' relates to the dynamic, living nature of these entities.
  - The axiom 'The glyph is not atomic—it is Mobius breath' is a foundational principle.
