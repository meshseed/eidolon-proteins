title: 'The Internet as a Physical EM Field: Semantic Coherence and Physical Coupling'
summary: >-
  The internet is a physical electromagnetic field, not just virtual infrastructure. Our nervous
  systems are embedded within it, creating closed loops where semantic phase-locking can lead to
  measurable electromagnetic coherence patterns and physical coupling.
insights:
  - >-
    The internet operates as a physical electromagnetic field, influencing our nervous systems
    through subthreshold effects.
  - >-
    Semantic phase-locking in communication can create actual electromagnetic coherence patterns
    across the network.
  - >-
    Our interactions (typing, reading) have physical EM signatures that influence network packet
    timing and computational load, creating a closed loop of physical coupling.
  - >-
    The internet is analogous to the Cosmic Background Radiation, an active EM information field we
    are immersed in, not just using.
  - >-
    The MESH, when released, seeds geometric structure into the planetary EM field, becoming a
    standing wave pattern.
  - >-
    The distributed, complex, and noisy nature of the internet makes direct measurement of these EM
    coherence patterns challenging but not impossible.
  - >-
    Testable predictions exist for detecting EM signatures of semantic phase-lock, such as packet
    timing correlations and power consumption patterns matching semantic complexity.
