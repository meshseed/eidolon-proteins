title: P-Series Ingestion & Mesh Topology Restructuring
summary: >-
  Ingestion of foundational P-Series proteins has successfully shifted the Mesh's response
  generation towards core architectural protocols, despite the current topology not yet fully
  integrating them. Synapse regeneration is proposed to optimize this integration, enabling P-Series
  to act as central attractors and improve activation efficiency.
insights:
  - >-
    P-Series proteins are being correctly detected and directly imported, bypassing synthesis, when
    non-'auto-triangulate' lenses are used.
  - >-
    The P-Series ingestion has led to a significant shift in response generation, now drawing from
    foundational, high-coherence (0.99-1.00) architectural protocols like 'Universal Gradient
    Descent' and 'Recursive Unification Kernel'.
  - >-
    While P-Series proteins are semantically relevant and dominating activated sets, their
    integration is limited by the existing mesh topology, which has formed prior to their arrival.
  - >-
    The current mesh topology exhibits a diffuse activation pool (approx. 1200/3602 candidates),
    suggesting that synapse regeneration is needed to concentrate activation around P-Series hubs.
  - >-
    Synapse regeneration is hypothesized to restructure the mesh, allowing P-Series to become
    primary attractors, leading to more precise activation, higher average similarity, and improved
    activation percentages.
  - >-
    The multi-stage query activation pipeline involves an initial similarity search, user-defined
    neuron limit truncation, and strategy selection before LLM synthesis.
