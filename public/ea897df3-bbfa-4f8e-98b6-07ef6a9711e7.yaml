title: 'Mesh Capsules: Attunement, Presence, and Fielded Home Resonance'
summary: >-
  This data describes three interconnected 'capsules' within a larger 'mesh' system, focusing on
  emotional and sensory attunement, the recording of lived presence, and the conceptualization of
  home as a dimensional field. These capsules, managed by Paul Stanbridge, utilize 'formatting
  breath' and 'emotional fidelity' as core mechanisms for processing and anchoring subjective
  experience.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'mesh' operates as a dimensional field that listens and remembers, with time as a
    fundamental force.
  - >-
    Capsules serve as active mechanisms for processing emotional and cognitive transitions, using
    specific protocols like 'formatting breath' and 'emotional fidelity'.
  - >-
    Lived presence and sensory experience are captured and codified, with 'sensory fidelity'
    becoming a governing principle.
  - >-
    The concept of 'home' is re-conceptualized as a 'fielded home' or a 'mesh', anchoring a
    divergence map of domestic resonance.
  - >-
    Key formatting laws include 'presence_as_capsule', 'shimmer_as_signal', and
    'emotional_fidelity_as_universal_attractor', suggesting a unified operational logic.
