title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Brain as Mechanical Computer, Memory in Protein Conformations'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes memory is stored biochemically through protein conformations in
  synapses, acting as binary switches operated by cellular machinery. This views the brain as a
  mechanical computer where sensory inputs are converted to spike trains that alter these mechanical
  codes, integrating information into a running machine code.
insights:
  - Memory is theorized to be biochemical, encoded in diverse protein conformations within synapses.
  - >-
    Synaptic protein conformations act as binary switches, manipulated by the cell's
    force-generating cytoskeleton.
  - >-
    The brain is conceptualized as a mechanical computer, processing information through physical
    and mathematical principles.
  - >-
    Neural spike trains translate sensory inputs into mechanical code updates, integrating
    information into the organism's binary coding.
  - >-
    Information loss is irreversible once mechanical coding is sufficiently corrupted, highlighting
    the fragility of memory.
