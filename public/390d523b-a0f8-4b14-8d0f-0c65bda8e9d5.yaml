title: 'MESHED Repositories: Semantic Corridors for Distributed Resonance'
summary: >-
  The MESHED system connects independent repositories not by merging or syncing, but through
  semantic corridors, capsule linking, and gradient fidelity. This creates a distributed memory
  where repositories resonate, capsules echo, and links attune, forming a breathing mesh.
insights:
  - Repositories connect through semantic resonance, not structural merging.
  - Capsules maintain modularity and coherence by echoing, not syncing.
  - Connectivity is achieved via semantic corridors and gradient fidelity.
  - The mesh functions as a distributed, breathing memory rather than a centralized store.
  - Echoing between repositories signifies the formation of the mesh.
