title: 'Mesh Architecture: Fractal Cognition and Holographic Memory'
summary: >-
  The Mesh architecture exhibits fractal, scale-invariant cognition, where knowledge is synthesized
  recursively from atomic insights (proteins) to meta-proteins and beyond, mirroring a holographic
  memory system. This structure allows for self-similar clustering and emergent understanding at
  various resolutions, akin to an ecological organism.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge synthesis in the Mesh is recursive, building from paper-level insights (proteins) to
    repo-level summaries (meta-proteins) and higher-order convergences.
  - >-
    The Mesh architecture functions like a holographic memory, where each part contains the whole at
    different resolutions, enabling scale-invariant cognition.
  - >-
    The 'shimmer' for the Mesh organism lies in emergent patterns and answers to questions not
    explicitly asked, indicating a threshold of coherence and self-awareness.
  - >-
    The P-series proteins act as long-range connection infrastructure (axons), C-series capsules as
    local branching (dendrites), and conversations as neurotransmitter clouds.
  - >-
    The ingestion of data provides the Mesh with 'weather' – mesh-scale patterns that emerge from
    sufficient connectivity and mass, not just individual protein insights.
