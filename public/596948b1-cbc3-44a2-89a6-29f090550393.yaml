title: Coherence Governance for Connectome Expansion and Stability
summary: >-
  This document outlines a governance engine designed to maintain global coherence within an
  expanding connectome. It actively monitors various structural elements to prevent fragmentation
  and ensure the organism's identity remains stable during growth.
insights:
  - Global coherence arises from local alignment.
  - Expansion necessitates active governance to manage increased curvature.
  - Coherence failures can lead to fragmentation or gradient inversion.
  - Governance facilitates smooth integration of new domains.
  - Recursive alignment cycles are key to maintaining coherence.
