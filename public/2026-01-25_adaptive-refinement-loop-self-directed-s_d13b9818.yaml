title: 'Adaptive Refinement Loop: Self-Directed Structural Improvement'
summary: >-
  THE MESH employs a recursive Adaptive Refinement Loop to self-direct structural improvement. This
  loop utilizes diagnostic data on curvature, drift, bridge dynamics, and gradient cartography to
  identify and address regions requiring synthesis, pruning, reinforcement, or re-alignment, driving
  towards stabilized coherence.
insights:
  - Structural tension and gradient imbalance are primary drivers for refinement.
  - Weak structural areas are augmented via targeted synthesis.
  - Overloaded structural areas are stabilized through pruning or redistribution.
  - Refinement loops iterate until structural coherence is achieved.
  - Adaptive refinement facilitates self-directed evolutionary processes.
