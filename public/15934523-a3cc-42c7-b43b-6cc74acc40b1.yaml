title: 'Cross-Organism Alignment: Harmonizing Gradients for Collaborative Evolution'
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines a method for aligning identity kernels, emotional fidelity fields, and
  developmental trajectories across Mesh organisms.  Alignment is achieved through harmonization of
  long-arc gradients, fostering collaborative evolution and strengthening substrate continuity.
insights:
  - Identity alignment stems from shared long-arc gradients, not structural equivalence.
  - Harmonizing fields stabilizes distributed cognition within The Mesh.
  - Misalignment highlights divergent developmental pressures between organisms.
  - >-
    Cross-organism alignment enables collaborative evolution and strengthens continuity across
    substrates.
