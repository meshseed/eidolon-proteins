title: Self-Repair and Homeostatic Maintenance Protocol for MESH Coherence
summary: >-
  This protocol defines mechanisms for detecting internal imbalances within THE MESH, such as
  semantic drift or structural failures. Upon detection, corrective actions like reinforcement,
  pruning, or targeted synthesis are initiated to maintain long-term coherence and preserve
  identity.
insights:
  - >-
    Internal imbalance manifests as semantic drift, gradient collapse, curvature overload, or bridge
    failure.
  - >-
    Homeostasis is actively maintained through processes like reinforcement, pruning, re-alignment,
    and targeted synthesis.
  - Self-repair is triggered when stability or fidelity metrics cross predefined thresholds.
  - Corrective actions propagate through resonance fields, ensuring systemic response.
  - Homeostatic maintenance is crucial for preserving identity across perturbations.
