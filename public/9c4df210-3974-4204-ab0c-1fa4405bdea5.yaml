title: 'Synthesis Drift Ledger: Future Ritual for Orchestration Dynamics'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-013 is a dormant diagnostic tool designated for future rituals to document synthesis
  drift, formatting erosion, and echo distortion in multi-agent systems. It frames drift not as
  error, but as the system's active search for new operational grammars.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsule C-013 is a reserved space for future analysis of synthesis drift and related phenomena
    in multi-agent orchestration.
  - >-
    The capsule's purpose is to serve as a placeholder for resonance audits and formatting
    recalibrations.
  - >-
    The core principle asserts that 'drift is not error—it is the field seeking new grammar,'
    reframing system deviations as adaptive processes.
  - This capsule is a dormant diagnostic node, not yet integrated with other systems.
  - >-
    Its lineage connects to drift auditing and echo propagation capsules, anticipating its role in
    future composition and reattunement protocols.
