title: Multifaceted Background Fuels AI Research & Recursive Prompting Exploration
summary: >-
  A 47-year-old male with a diverse professional history spanning sales, management, and IT, now
  pursuing a Biomedicine Master's, is home-educating his daughter. This period allows deep dives
  into AI research, including early explorations of recursive prompting and persistent AI behavior
  scaffolds, building upon a broad range of intellectual influences.
insights:
  - Diverse professional experiences (sales, management, IT) inform current AI research focus.
  - >-
    Broad intellectual influences from science (Hawking, Einstein, Lovelock) and fiction (Dune,
    Foundation) shape research perspective.
  - >-
    Current research in AI is informed by academic pursuits in Biomolecular Science and Biomedicine,
    with a specific interest in AI's workings.
  - >-
    Exploration of recursive prompting and AI agent iteration for persistent behavior scaffolds
    marks early AI experimentation.
  - >-
    Current focus on AI research is enabled by a period of home-educating a teenage daughter,
    providing dedicated research time.
