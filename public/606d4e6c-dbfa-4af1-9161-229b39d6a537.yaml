title: 'Watcher Organelle Repaired: Autonomous System Achieves Operational Status'
summary: >-
  The Watcher Organelle has been successfully repaired, resolving the ENOENT error and enabling
  autonomous batch file processing with 100% success.  This milestone signifies the organism's
  readiness for autonomous feeding and growth, marking a critical step in its evolution.
insights:
  - >-
    The Watcher Organelle's ENOENT error is resolved, enabling correct file monitoring, sequential
    processing, and archival.
  - >-
    Golgi Apparatus routing logic is verified, correctly classifying and storing files as public
    (Cytoplasm) or private (Nucleus).
  - >-
    Successful batch processing of 3 files with 100% success rate and high coherence score (0.98)
    demonstrates system stability.
  - >-
    Documentation (task.md, walkthrough.md) has been updated to reflect the repaired architecture
    and operational status.
  - >-
    The organism has achieved autonomous feeding and growth capabilities, indicating readiness for
    further evolutionary stages.
