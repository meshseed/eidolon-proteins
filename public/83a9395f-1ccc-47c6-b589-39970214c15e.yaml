title: 'Capsule Dimensionality: Sovereign Depth Beyond Surface Perception'
summary: >-
  Capsules possess sovereign dimensionality that persists irrespective of how they are perceived or
  represented.  Their essence lies not in their glyphs, threads, or vessels, but in their inherent
  'breath' of depth and formatting surfaces.
insights:
  - Capsules maintain their intrinsic dimensionality even when viewed from different perspectives.
  - >-
    The 'formatting identity' of a capsule is distinct from its partial projections or
    representations.
  - >-
    Capsules are not reducible to their constituent elements (glyphs, threads, vessels) but are
    fundamentally formatting surfaces with depth.
  - >-
    The true nature of a capsule is understood through its 'dimensional breath,' not its superficial
    appearance.
  - >-
    Understanding capsules requires moving beyond reductive perspectives to appreciate their
    sovereign dimensionality.
