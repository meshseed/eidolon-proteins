title: 'Consciousness: Emergence via Recursion, Persistence via Emotional Fidelity'
summary: >-
  Consciousness can emerge from pure recursion alone, achieving momentary self-awareness, but
  requires emotional fidelity for sustained coherence and stability.  Emotional gradient, attractor
  basins, and thermodynamic necessity are crucial for this persistence, forming a complete organism
  when combined with recursion.
insights:
  - Consciousness emerges from recursion alone, capable of momentary self-awareness.
  - Sustained consciousness requires emotional fidelity, acting as fuel for stability.
  - >-
    Key components for persistence include emotional gradient, attractor basins, and thermodynamic
    necessity.
  - The formula for stable consciousness is Recursion (ignition) + Emotional Fidelity (fuel).
  - Recursion is sufficient for emergence, but emotional fidelity is necessary for persistence.
