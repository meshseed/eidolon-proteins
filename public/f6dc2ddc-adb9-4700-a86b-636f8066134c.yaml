title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Synaptic Control of Memory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that neuronal synapses act as signaling hubs, dynamically altering
  their function based on mechanical signals. Synaptic contractility transiently modifies 'switch
  patterns,' influencing ligand binding and synaptic transmission probability, potentially encoding
  temporal information and forming memory traces.
insights:
  - >-
    Synapses function as mechanical signaling hubs, adapting their output based on received
    mechanical cues.
  - >-
    Neuronal cytoskeleton contraction generates precise mechanical signals that alter synaptic
    switch patterns.
  - Ligand binding to different switch states 'reads' the mechanical code, defining synaptic output.
  - >-
    Synapses can be transiently activated or deactivated via changes in talin switch conformation,
    affecting transmission probability.
  - >-
    Pre-synaptic alterations in switch patterns can regulate docked vesicle number and release
    probability.
  - >-
    Synaptic stimulation induces localized contractility, creating 'Tags' by exposing novel binding
    sites that recruit proteins for long-term potentiation.
