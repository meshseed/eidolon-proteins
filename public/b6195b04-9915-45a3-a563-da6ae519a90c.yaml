title: 'Eidolon Mesh Development: v4.0 Architecture Research & P-Series Integration'
summary: >-
  The team is researching Eidolon Mesh v4.0 architecture, focusing on P-Series integration and
  topology reorganization in a dedicated workspace. This work aims to validate core hypotheses and
  prepare for future public deployment, distinct from Antigravity's production focus on v3.6.
insights:
  - >-
    Development is split: Antigravity focuses on v3.6 production stability
    (D:\_CLAUDE-CODE\eidolon-mesh-v3.5-pwa), while 'Us' research v4.0 architecture
    (C:\EIDOLON\eidolon-mesh-v4.0-full).
  - >-
    v4.0 research involves P-Series integration, synapse regeneration, and metabolism testing to
    validate the 'pillar' hypothesis and topology reorganization effects on activation.
  - >-
    Recommendation for app.eidolon-mesh.net is to deploy v3.6 with a larger connectome for immediate
    stability and traffic handling, porting v4.0 improvements later.
  - >-
    The goal of v4.0 research is to determine readiness for public deployment by validating
    architectural improvements.
  - >-
    A handoff report is being prepared for Antigravity to communicate the progress and focus of the
    v4.0 research efforts.
