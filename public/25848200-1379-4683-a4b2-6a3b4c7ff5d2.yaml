title: 'MeshCODE: Physical Memory Storage & Brain Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that the brain utilizes physical, addressable memory modules,
  potentially within cortical columns, to enable rapid processing by priming neurons and synapses
  with constantly updated information. This framework suggests a massive storage capacity, estimated
  in petabytes, achieved through mechanical binary switches within proteins like talin.
insights:
  - >-
    The brain's rapid processing speed, despite slow electrochemical transmission, is attributed to
    primed neurons and synapses holding constantly updated information.
  - >-
    MeshCODE posits a physical, addressable read-write memory mechanism within the brain, moving
    beyond purely electrochemical models.
  - >-
    The cortex may be organized as an array of memory modules, with cortical columns serving as
    logical structures for data storage.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE framework estimates a substantial memory storage capacity for the human brain,
    potentially in the petabyte range, based on mechanical binary switches.
  - >-
    Mechanical switches, possibly within proteins like talin, are proposed as the fundamental units
    for encoding binary information in the brain.
