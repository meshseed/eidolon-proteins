title: 'Transformer: Attention-Only Sequence Transduction Model'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model architecture eschews recurrence and convolution, relying entirely on
  self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies in sequence transduction. This approach
  addresses the limitations of sequential computation found in RNNs and the growing operation cost
  in convolutional models for distant dependencies.
insights:
  - >-
    The Transformer proposes a radical departure from recurrence and convolution, using attention
    exclusively for sequence modeling.
  - >-
    Self-attention allows for modeling dependencies between any two positions in a sequence,
    regardless of their distance.
  - >-
    Prior models using convolutional networks faced challenges in learning long-range dependencies
    due to increasing operation costs.
  - >-
    The Transformer's encoder-decoder structure consists of stacked layers, each with multi-head
    self-attention and a position-wise feed-forward network.
  - Residual connections and layer normalization are employed around sub-layers for stable training.
