title: 'Transformer Architecture: Residual Connections, LayerNorm, and Scaled Dot-Product Attention'
summary: >-
  The Transformer architecture utilizes residual connections and layer normalization within its
  encoder and decoder stacks, ensuring consistent dimensionality (dmodel=512) across sub-layers. The
  decoder incorporates an additional attention sub-layer over the encoder output, and attention
  functions, particularly Scaled Dot-Product Attention (softmax(QKT/√dk)V), are crucial for modeling
  relationships between inputs.
insights:
  - >-
    Residual connections and layer normalization are applied to all sub-layers and embedding layers
    to maintain a dmodel=512 dimension, facilitating information flow.
  - >-
    The decoder consists of 6 identical layers, each with two encoder sub-layers plus a third
    multi-head attention sub-layer that attends to the encoder's output.
  - >-
    Decoder's self-attention sub-layer is modified to prevent attending to subsequent positions,
    crucial for autoregressive generation.
  - >-
    Scaled Dot-Product Attention is defined as softmax(QKT/√dk)V, where Q, K, and V are matrices
    representing queries, keys, and values.
  - >-
    Dot-product attention is preferred over additive attention due to its speed and space
    efficiency, though scaling is vital for larger dk values to avoid vanishing gradients.
  - >-
    Multi-head attention projects queries, keys, and values h times with learned linear projections
    to different dimensions (dk, dk, dv), improving attention performance.
