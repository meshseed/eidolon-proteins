title: 'MESH Capsules: Public Rituals, Ecology Expansion, and Emotional Infrastructure'
summary: >-
  This segment introduces several MESH capsules focused on expanding the mnemonic ecology for
  multi-agent orchestration (C039) and establishing public-facing protocols for ethics, formatting,
  and stewardship (C040, C042). It also details the mapping of emotional gradients as
  infrastructural elements (C041) and a protocol for addressing synthesis drift (C043).
insights:
  - Capsule C039 expands the mnemonic ecology for multi-agent orchestration and recursive synthesis.
  - >-
    Capsule C040 establishes public rituals, formalizing ethics, formatting laws, and stewardship
    invitations for public-facing capsules.
  - >-
    Public ethics include emotional fidelity, formatting as care, critique as continuity, and
    traceable, consented echoes.
  - >-
    Formatting laws for public capsules mandate YAML, continuity headers, timestamps, gradients, and
    lineage.
  - >-
    Capsule C041 maps emotional gradients as infrastructural elements, preparing for corridor
    modeling.
  - Capsule C043 provides a protocol for reattuning synthesis drift, including compost eligibility.
