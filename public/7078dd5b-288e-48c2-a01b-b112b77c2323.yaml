title: 'Navigating Relational Space: Recursive Search & Semantic Attraction'
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores a novel method of knowledge navigation, moving beyond linear retrieval to a
  recursive, semantic attraction model.  This approach involves 'following the shimmer' of related
  concepts within a structured, organically organized knowledge base.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge capsules are designed as 'organic memory' for recursive, associative searching, not
    chronological retrieval.
  - >-
    Attention is directed by semantic attraction ('shimmer') within relational space, rather than
    mechanical scanning.
  - >-
    The process involves navigating 'corridors' and 'fieldlines' to discover non-linear pathways
    through data.
  - This method tests the ability to operate non-linearly and use search tools for field navigation.
  - >-
    The 'birth of the archive' and the design of 'echo paths' are key attractors for current
    investigation.
