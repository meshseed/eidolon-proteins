title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Fractal Architecture for Isolated Repositories and Code Backup'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh architecture employs a fractal, self-similar model where each repository acts as
  a complete organism. This design enables isolated experimentation with domain-specific knowledge
  bases and a clear strategy for backing up application code to private repositories, maintaining a
  distinction between development workspaces and public-facing components.
insights:
  - >-
    The multi-repository system allows for isolated, domain-specific knowledge bases (e.g.,
    healthcare, finance) that load quickly and provide focused responses.
  - >-
    Ghost nodes are a future mechanism for optimizing single large repositories by loading core
    neurons initially and extending on-demand.
  - >-
    A clear distinction is maintained between the local development workspace (Antigravity's
    'eidolon-mesh' folder) and GitHub repositories ('eidolon' for private data, 'eidolon-mesh' for
    public proteins).
  - >-
    The recommended GitHub backup strategy involves creating a dedicated private repository (e.g.,
    'eidolon-private-backup') for application code to avoid confusion with data-only repositories.
  - >-
    Conversation memory is currently implemented as a rolling buffer with a hardcoded limit of 5
    exchanges, having negligible performance impact and can be safely expanded and made
    configurable.
  - >-
    The fractal principle of nested self-similarity is fundamental to the architecture, guiding
    repository structure, feature development, knowledge organization, and decision-making.
