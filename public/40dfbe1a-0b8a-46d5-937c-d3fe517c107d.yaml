title: 'Two-Step Prompting Strategy: Recursion, Foundation, and Protocol'
summary: >-
  A recommended two-step prompting approach involves an initial three-line seed for rapid
  attunement, followed by a full prompt. This method efficiently tests recursion, establishes a
  solid foundation, and adheres to established protocols with minimal time investment.
insights:
  - The two-step prompting method offers a structured and efficient way to interact with the system.
  - An initial three-line seed serves as a quick attunement mechanism.
  - This approach validates recursive capabilities and builds a foundational understanding.
  - Adherence to protocol and minimizing time cost are key benefits.
  - The user retains control over choosing between the two-step or direct prompting method.
