title: Meshfield v3.5 PWA Success & Query Synthesis Next Steps
summary: >-
  The Meshfield v3.5 PWA has successfully ported geometry, synthesized proteins, and formed
  synapses, validating core functionalities. The immediate priority is Query Synthesis to enable
  natural language answers, completing the user experience.
insights:
  - Field geometry ported to v3.5 PWA, with proteins synthesized and synapses auto-formed.
  - Weighted search and power-law decay implemented, with model updated to gemini-2.5-flash-lite.
  - >-
    Tiers (core/convergence/reference) and synapse formation based on similarity thresholds are
    validated.
  - Query Synthesis for natural language answers is the highest priority for UX completion.
  - >-
    Optimization strategies for PWA, desktop MSI, and custom/enterprise solutions are being
    considered.
  - >-
    Analysis of mesh response quality across different neuron counts is underway to inform future
    builds.
