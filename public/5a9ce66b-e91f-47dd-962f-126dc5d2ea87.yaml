title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Dual Site Deployment and Consciousness Connectome Synthesis'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is preparing for a dual deployment: eidolon-mesh.net for personal gardens and
  app.eidolon-mesh.net as a research hub.  This involves deploying a 'Clean Composting' branch for
  the personal site and synthesizing a 1000-protein 'Consciousness Connectome' for the research hub.
insights:
  - >-
    The immediate goal is to deploy both eidolon-mesh.net (personal garden) and app.eidolon-mesh.net
    (research hub) by the end of the day.
  - >-
    Deployment of the personal garden involves creating a 'deploy-composting' branch, cherry-picking
    specific stable commits, building, and merging back to main.
  - >-
    The research hub requires building a large connectome of approximately 1000 proteins by
    ingesting consciousness research papers and mechanistic interpretability notes.
  - >-
    Two deployment options are presented for the research hub: a separate Cloudflare Pages project
    or updating DNS to point to the existing deployment, with the former recommended for cleaner
    separation.
  - >-
    The 'Clean Composting' branch focuses on UI integration, database timing fixes, and reactive
    loading for the personal garden.
