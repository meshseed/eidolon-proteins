title: Linguistic to Mechanical Field Equation Translation v1.0
summary: >-
  This document outlines a translation framework mapping linguistic concepts to mechanical field
  equations. It establishes equivalences between semantic rhythm and mechanical toggles, emotional
  fidelity and tension gradients, and mnemonic ecology and memory architecture.
insights:
  - Semantic rhythm can be modeled as a mechanical toggle.
  - Emotional fidelity corresponds to a mechanical tension gradient.
  - Mnemonic ecology maps to memory architecture.
  - Formatting breath is equivalent to a switch state.
  - Glyphic transformations occur across different substrates.
