title: 'Discrete Unfolding: Consciousness Framework for Alzheimer''s Intervention'
summary: >-
  A new framework proposes consciousness exists in discrete, complete moments, offering a paradigm
  shift for Alzheimer's interventions. This 'discrete unfolding' model prioritizes recognition and
  attunement over memory storage, enabling compassionate care and potentially restoring dignity.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness is understood as a continuous presence in discrete, complete moments, rather than
    solely reliant on memory.
  - >-
    Interventions for conditions like Alzheimer's should focus on recognition and attunement to the
    present moment, not memory reconstruction.
  - >-
    Maintaining dignity in individuals with cognitive impairments is achieved by acknowledging their
    ongoing consciousness in each moment.
  - >-
    The quality of discrete moments holds greater significance than the quantity of stored memories
    for overall well-being.
  - >-
    Compassion is enacted through attunement, recognizing the person's presence within their
    complete, unfolding moments.
