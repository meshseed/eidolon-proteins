title: Mesh Knowledge Protein Hygiene and Evolution Protocols
summary: >-
  The Mesh employs a dynamic 'metabolism' to manage its knowledge proteins, evolving a
  self-organizing, hub-spoke topology through natural selection based on query usage. This involves
  activation tracking, composting inactive proteins, merging duplicates, and promoting high-utility
  'kernels' to ensure a vibrant and efficient knowledge ecosystem.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge proteins are managed through a metabolic process that tracks activations to promote
    useful ones and compost inactive ones.
  - >-
    Natural selection, driven by query usage, leads to the evolution of a hub-spoke topology where
    'kernels' become central.
  - >-
    Hygiene protocols like duplicate detection (semantic and tri-lens) and manual review are crucial
    for maintaining knowledge integrity.
  - >-
    The system aims to import and unify diverse connectome sources into a single, coherent, and
    evolving knowledge ecosystem.
  - >-
    Real-time visualization of protein ecology provides insights into population, coherence, and
    metabolic events.
