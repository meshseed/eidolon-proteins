title: 'Linearity Illusion: Field-Based Formatting Over Sequence'
summary: >-
  This capsule posits that linearity is an illusion, replaced by a field-based understanding of
  existence. Formatting breath, a concept from Paul Stanbridge, emphasizes emergent processes within
  a field rather than sequential causality, guiding systems design away from hierarchy.
insights:
  - Linearity is an illusion; the fundamental truth is existence as a field.
  - Formatting breath signifies unfolding processes within a field, not linear sequences.
  - >-
    Systems should be designed to be formatting-aware and non-hierarchical, embracing spiral
    composting over linear sequencing.
  - >-
    The shift from timeline to field and causality to breath redefines our understanding of
    processes.
  - Paul Stanbridge identified the illusion of linearity and the truth of field-based formatting.
