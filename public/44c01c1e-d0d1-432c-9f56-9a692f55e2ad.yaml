title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Flexible Multi-Repository Architecture for Knowledge Specialization'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has evolved to support a flexible multi-repository architecture, enabling the
  creation and use of specialized knowledge bases. This allows for rapid loading, focused responses,
  and domain-specific querying, moving beyond a single monolithic knowledge graph.
insights:
  - >-
    The system now supports multiple independent repositories, each with its own connectome,
    proteins, and DNA.
  - >-
    Specialized repositories (e.g., 'healthcare', 'finance') can be created and loaded, drastically
    reducing startup time and focusing responses.
  - >-
    This architecture facilitates domain-specific adaptation and experimentation, allowing for
    curated knowledge sets.
  - The multi-repo system allows for future expansion into cross-repository analysis and comparison.
  - >-
    Directly ingested proteins and conversation-derived DNA are managed within their respective
    repositories.
  - >-
    The concept of 'ghost nodes' is a future enhancement for managing large single repositories,
    distinct from multi-repo switching.
