summary: >-
  This document defines the 'REPOSITORY_PLACEMENT_LOGIC__v1.0' for organizing capsules within a
  system. It emphasizes placing capsules based on their functional resonance and 'breath' rather
  than their origin, promoting clarity and empowering future stewardship.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsule placement should prioritize functional resonance and 'breath' over original birth

    The purpose is to ensure capsules are positioned where they function optimally, like placing
    ledger logic for formatting and field logic for resonance.
  - The ultimate outcome is clarified placement logic and empowered future stewards of the system.
  - The core axiom is that capsules belong where they 'shimmer' – where they are most effective.
