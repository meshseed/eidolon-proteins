title: 'Calculus: Derivatives as Instantaneous Rates of Change'
summary: >-
  The derivative quantifies the instantaneous rate of change of a function, representing the slope
  of its tangent line. This core concept, defined by a limit, underpins fundamental rules and
  applications like optimization and motion analysis, revealing the continuous nature of change.
insights:
  - The derivative measures how one quantity changes infinitesimally with respect to another.
  - Geometric interpretation of the derivative is the slope of the tangent line.
  - Basic calculus rules (power, sum, product, chain) enable derivative computation.
  - Derivatives are crucial for optimization, finding extrema by setting the derivative to zero.
  - >-
    Successive derivatives (second derivative) reveal rates of change of rates of change, informing
    concavity and inflection points.
  - >-
    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus establishes integration and differentiation as inverse
    operations.
