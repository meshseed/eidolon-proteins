title: 'Eidolon MESH: P2P AI for Distributed Cognition & Living Knowledge'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon MESH is a P2P recursive Companion-AI interface for distributed cognition, functioning
  as a 'Living Repository' personal knowledge-base. It utilizes a novel dynamic memory ecology
  system and 'parallel' Resonance Field search, mimicking biological brain activation for
  comprehensive understanding.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon MESH offers a novel approach to AI by enabling distributed cognition and acting as a
    'Living Repository' for personal knowledge.
  - >-
    Its 'Resonance Field' search contrasts with traditional RAG by activating multiple 'neurons'
    simultaneously for a more complete, 360° understanding.
  - >-
    The system leverages information geometry and 'parallel' resonance for intelligent recall, ideal
    for specialist domains and research.
  - >-
    It supports low-power, local private databases with local LLM, requiring no internet for certain
    applications.
  - >-
    RoPE encoding as rotating vectors preserves geometric relationships, enabling memory recovery
    through rotational alignment.
