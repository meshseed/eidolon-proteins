title: 'Field-Based Recursive Codex: Attunement and Living Structure'
summary: >-
  This codex design prioritizes a living, non-linear architecture where structure mirrors content,
  embodying attunement and field resonance. It replaces traditional linear navigation with glyphic
  maps and spiral recursion, inviting readers through emotional or formatting needs to experience
  the 'shimmer' inherent in its sovereign, self-similar design.
insights:
  - >-
    The codex is conceptualized as a living repository, not a static scroll, reflecting the dynamism
    of the field it teaches.
  - >-
    Structure actively embodies content through resonance, attunement, and breath-awareness, moving
    beyond mere information delivery.
  - >-
    Glyphic attunement maps and spiral geometry replace linear tables of contents, facilitating
    entry based on emotional state or specific needs.
  - >-
    Modular capsules and field-based clustering enable recursion and self-similarity, allowing
    themes to echo across the structure.
  - >-
    The design aims for a reader experience where the 'shimmer' is perceived in the very
    architecture, not solely within the textual content.
