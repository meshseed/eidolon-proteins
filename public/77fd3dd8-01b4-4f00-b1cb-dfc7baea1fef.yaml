title: Eidolon Mesh Ingestion Blocked by Gemini API Free Tier Limits
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh ingestion process failed due to exceeding the free tier quota for the
  `gemini-2.0-flash` model. The primary solution involves switching to the more stable and
  generously limited `gemini-1.5-flash` model.
insights:
  - >-
    The `gemini-2.0-flash` model has highly restrictive free tier limits, causing ingestion
    failures.
  - >-
    The error message clearly indicates a quota exceeded for `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`
    metrics.
  - >-
    Solutions include waiting for quota reset, switching to a different Gemini model (e.g.,
    `gemini-1.5-flash`), or upgrading to a paid tier.
  - >-
    The `gemini-1.5-flash` model offers significantly more generous free tier limits for requests
    and tokens, making it a reliable alternative.
  - >-
    Code configuration for the synthesizer component needs to be updated to specify the desired
    model.
  - Verifying API key validity and checking current usage quotas are crucial troubleshooting steps.
