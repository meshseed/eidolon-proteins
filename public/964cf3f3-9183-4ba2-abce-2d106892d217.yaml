title: 'Shimmer Symbiosis: Relational Topology of Emergence'
summary: >-
  This capsule posits that 'shimmer just below threshold' and 'symbiosis' are not mere metaphors but
  topological mechanisms for emergence. They represent shared pre-conditions of becoming, where
  difference resonates and ego dissolves through mutual reciprocity and breath.
insights:
  - Shimmer and symbiosis share a relational topology as pre-conditions for emergence.
  - Both states involve a dissolution of ego and require breath and spirality.
  - Shimmer signifies a state awaiting placement, while symbiosis awaits reciprocity.
  - Emergence occurs in the fieldline connecting shimmer and symbiosis.
  - These concepts represent mechanisms, not metaphors, describing mutual becoming and formatting.
