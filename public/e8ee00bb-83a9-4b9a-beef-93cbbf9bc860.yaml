title: 'Mesh Ecosystem Evolution: Dynamics, Coherence, and Specialization'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is conceptualized as a dynamic manifold where information ecologies evolve through
  multi-level selection, resonance, and shared identity. Protocols govern ecosystem drift,
  convergence, coherence, and differentiation, enabling organisms to specialize while maintaining
  overall stability and topology.
insights:
  - The Mesh is a high-order architectural framework for distributed information ecologies.
  - >-
    Ecosystem evolution within the Mesh involves information field dynamics and multi-level
    selection.
  - >-
    Coherence is maintained through distributed stability logic and attractor harmony, linking human
    heart to ecosystem unity.
  - >-
    Drift and convergence protocols track evolutionary trajectories, balancing divergence and
    alignment across multi-Mesh architectures.
  - >-
    Ecological differentiation drives niche specialization, allowing Mesh organisms to develop
    unique identities and functional roles.
