title: 'Coherence Governance Engine: Ensuring Global Stability During Connectome Expansion'
summary: >-
  A governance mechanism is defined to maintain global coherence within an expanding connectome. It
  actively monitors and manages coherence across various structural components, preventing
  fragmentation and identity destabilization during growth.
insights:
  - Coherence is a global emergent property derived from local alignment.
  - Expansion necessitates active governance to manage increased curvature and maintain stability.
  - Failures in coherence manifest as fragmentation or gradient inversions.
  - Governance ensures seamless integration of new domains into the existing structure.
  - Coherence is sustained through recursive alignment cycles.
