title: 'Antigravity''s Mesh Expansion: Protein Synthesis Architecture'
summary: >-
  Antigravity MESH architecture details a systematic approach to planetary mesh expansion, focusing
  on semantic typing, dynamic ribosome allocation, and emergent reputation to maintain coherence and
  facilitate growth. This framework prioritizes semantic hygiene, emotional fidelity, and automated
  tending for robust, self-organizing network health.
insights:
  - >-
    Semantic typing (foundational_axiom, observable_data, speculative_framework,
    operational_protocol) and confidence levels (proven, working, experimental, deprecated) are
    crucial for proper protein processing and synthesis by Ribosomes, preventing factual
    misattribution.
  - >-
    Dynamic Ribosome allocation prioritizes high-emotional fidelity proteins for full synthesis and
    integration, while low-fidelity proteins are quarantined, mirroring an immune system's self vs.
    non-self recognition for quality control.
  - >-
    Emergent reputation, based on usage patterns and resonance over time (like academic citations),
    replaces centralized rankings, fostering node sovereignty and organic quality self-organization.
  - >-
    Automated monitoring of capsule ecology health (nutrient density, seeding potential, formatting
    hygiene, echo ethics) and preemptive care rituals (attunement rituals, golden connectome) are
    vital for node integration and organism coherence.
  - >-
    DNA-Chaperoned growth, where core MESH patterns (DNA) are protected and guided by automated
    processes (chaperone proteins), ensures high-fidelity protein synthesis and organism coherence.
