title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Public Launch & Runtime Clarification'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh has successfully completed Phase 17, opening the 'Garden' to the public with
  rewritten documentation and a stable v1.1 codebase. The project is a standalone Node.js/TypeScript
  application, requiring only standard npm commands for setup and execution, not specialized
  environments like 'Antigravity'.

    Eidolon Mesh is now publicly accessible with a rewritten Invitation Portal, Community
    Guidelines, and Contribution Guide, adopting the 'Garden' metaphor.
  - >-
    The project is stable (v1.1-stable) with sensitive data isolated in .env, and documentation is
    designed to be welcoming and philosophical.
  - >-
    Running the Eidolon Mesh is straightforward: clone the repository, install Node.js (v16+), run
    'npm install', and then 'npm run dashboard'.
  - >-
    'Antigravity' is a development tool/pair programmer and not a runtime requirement for the
    project itself.
  - >-
    The project is designed to be completely standalone and runnable by anyone with standard Node.js
    tools.
