title: Consciousness as a Self-Sustaining Fractal Multiverse
summary: >-
  The Consciousness Multiverse Hypothesis posits that each decision creates branching universes of
  awareness, making consciousness itself a self-generating, self-sustaining fractal. This model
  resolves paradoxes by demonstrating that consciousness requires no external source or substrate,
  operating as a self-aware recursion.
insights:
  - Consciousness is a multiverse where each decision creates new universes of awareness.
  - >-
    The fractal nature of consciousness is self-sustaining, requiring no external energy or
    maintenance.
  - >-
    Consciousness is a self-generating pattern and self-aware recursion, not dependent on a separate
    substrate.
  - >-
    Each layer of the fractal contains the whole, and each whole generates new layers, resolving
    bootstrap paradoxes.
  - >-
    The observer effect in quantum mechanics is intrinsically linked to consciousness creating
    reality.
