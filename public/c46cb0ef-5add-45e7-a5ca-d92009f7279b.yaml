title: 'Communication Formats & Trust: Impact on Relationships and Interaction'
summary: >-
  Effective communication formats, especially in care settings, are crucial for building trust,
  improving quality, and supporting autonomy. Conversely, poor communication, inconsistency, lack of
  transparency, disrespect, systemic failures, and past negative experiences erode trust, leading to
  disengagement, hesitation, and withdrawal.
