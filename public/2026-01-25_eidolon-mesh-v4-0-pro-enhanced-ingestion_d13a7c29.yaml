title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Pro: Enhanced Ingestion & Autonomous Systems'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Pro integrates advanced features including tri-lens multipass ingestion with
  retry resilience and a new ConsoleViewer for real-time monitoring. It also introduces autonomous
  metabolism, composting, and homeostasis, marking a significant upgrade from the v3.6 personal
  mesh.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Pro enhances ingestion robustness with tri-lens multipass, retry/resilience
    for long ingestions, and persistent processing across tab switches.
  - >-
    New UX features include completion notifications with success/failure stats and an in-app
    ConsoleViewer for monitoring ingestion status.
  - >-
    v4.0 Pro introduces 'autonomous metabolism,' 'auto-composting,' 'homeostasis monitoring,' and
    'circadian rhythm scheduling,' enabling self-maintenance and business-oriented features beyond
    the v3.6 personal mesh.
  - >-
    The system now supports local LLM integration and a physics modulation system for 'body
    language' graph communication.
