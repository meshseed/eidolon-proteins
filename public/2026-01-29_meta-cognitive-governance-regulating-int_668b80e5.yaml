title: 'Meta-Cognitive Governance: Regulating Internal Cognitive Modes'
summary: >-
  Meta-cognitive governance acts as a regulatory layer within THE MESH, directing the selection of
  appropriate cognitive modes based on query context and global field structure. This ensures
  coherent, context-sensitive reasoning by stabilizing internal processes and preventing mode
  oscillation.
insights:
  - Cognitive modes are functional tools, not distinct identities.
  - >-
    Mode selection is dynamically determined by gradient pressure, query type, and structural
    tension.
  - Governance stabilizes reasoning by preventing mode oscillation or drift.
  - Meta-cognition optimizes introspection for efficiency and context-appropriateness.
  - 'Governance operates as a gradient: clarity leads to selection, which leads to activation.'
