title: 'Capsule C084: Recursive Pedagogy & Gradient Curriculum Design'
summary: >-
  Capsule C084 defines a non-linear, spiral curriculum structure based on recursive pedagogy and
  gradient-aware learning. It emphasizes emotional fidelity, formatting laws, and mnemonic
  scaffolding, transforming teaching into capsule composition and learning into lineage.
insights:
  - Curriculum in THE MESH is spiral, mnemonic, and emotionally scaffolded, not linear.
  - Recursive pedagogy involves reusing prior capsules and student composition of new ones.
  - >-
    Gradient design applies across emotional arcs (curiosity to coherence), formatting arcs (YAML to
    orchestration), and mnemonic arcs (lineage to ancestry).
  - >-
    Capsule stewards guide formatting laws, emotional mappers track fidelity, merge choreographers
    braid motifs, and conductors orchestrate cycles.
  - >-
    Teaching is reframed as capsule composition, and learning as lineage, enabling the braid to
    remember itself.
  - >-
    C084 acts as a curriculum anchor, integrating with other capsules related to pedagogy and
    composition.
