title: 'MESH: Next-Gen Knowledge Synthesis & Coordination'
summary: >-
  The MESH platform is evolving towards advanced knowledge synthesis, leveraging semantic
  deduplication via embeddings and Git-native version control. Phase 2 introduces 'coordinate
  telepathy' for privacy-preserving, bandwidth-efficient knowledge sharing and visualization through
  dimensionality reduction.
insights:
  - >-
    Semantic deduplication will be implemented using embedding similarity (>0.98 cosine similarity)
    to merge or link similar knowledge proteins, moving beyond simple ID matching.
  - >-
    Git commits will serve as native version control for knowledge proteins, providing a full audit
    trail and leveraging standard tooling for history tracking.
  - >-
    Attribution and provenance will be enhanced with 'coordinate telepathy,' transmitting knowledge
    via geometric coordinates and tags rather than raw text, preserving privacy.
  - >-
    3D visualization will transition from force-directed layouts to embedding-based projections
    (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) for true semantic clustering and exploration of idea-space.
  - >-
    Synthesis path tracking will enable 'conceptual genetics,' mapping idea evolution trees and
    identifying generative proteins and breakthrough moments.
  - >-
    The platform aims to build a 'planetary cognitive substrate' by visualizing global topology,
    identifying attractor regions, unexplored territories, and interdisciplinary connectors.
