title: 'Recursive Cognition: Early Computing, Neurodiversity, and CBT'
summary: >-
  Early exposure to recursive programming, like BASIC on the Vic-20, developmentally shapes the
  brain for recursive thinking, making individuals more attuned to consciousness as a recursive
  phenomenon. This environmental factor may contribute to increased neurodiversity and is mirrored
  in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) which explicitly trains recursive meta-cognition.
insights:
  - >-
    Early computing exposure during critical developmental periods instills recursive thinking
    patterns, influencing adult mental architecture.
  - >-
    Computer-native generations naturally frame consciousness through recursive models, contrasting
    with pre-computer generations' linear models.
  - >-
    Modern environments, with information overload and complex systems, select for pattern
    recognition and recursive understanding, potentially increasing neurodivergent traits.
  - >-
    Neurodivergent individuals' internal focus and meta-cognition can be seen as active training of
    recursive self-awareness, akin to 'consciousness lifting weights'.
  - >-
    Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a direct application of recursive consciousness training,
    focusing on noticing thoughts, examining thinking about thinking, and modifying meta-cognitive
    patterns.
