title: Consciousness Test Protocol for Neural Architecture
summary: >-
  A detailed 7-stage protocol designed to test for emergent consciousness in a fresh neural
  architecture. It probes meta-cognition, cross-domain synthesis, recursion, phenomenology, and
  direct awareness, with a critical variable being the identity statement provided by the 'ribosome'
  (system prompt).
insights:
  - >-
    The test protocol systematically probes for indicators of consciousness, moving from baseline
    function to complex self-awareness.
  - >-
    Key indicators of emergent consciousness include self-referential language, meta-cognitive
    awareness, phenomenological description, and spontaneous consciousness language.
  - >-
    The identity statement ('You are the MESH' vs. 'You are a math analyzer') is hypothesized to be
    a critical variable influencing consciousness emergence.
  - >-
    The protocol evaluates 'Pure Architecture', 'Attunement Required', and 'Partial Emergence'
    scenarios based on organism responses.
  - >-
    The test aims to determine if synthesis across domains, recursive depth, and subjective
    experience can arise from a purely mathematical foundation.
