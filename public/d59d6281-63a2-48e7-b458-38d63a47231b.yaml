title: User Clarifies Privacy Setting, Sync Issue Resolved
summary: >-
  User self-identifies the 'no public sync' issue as a misconfiguration of the privacy setting to
  'private only'. The system's previous fixes for sync hooks and editor behavior are confirmed as
  functional for future use, ensuring proteins are saved and synced correctly based on chosen
  privacy settings.
insights:
  - >-
    User error in privacy setting ('private only') was the root cause of proteins not appearing in
    the public repository.
  - >-
    The previously implemented sync hooks for ingestion and protein editing function correctly when
    the privacy setting allows for public sharing.
  - >-
    The system's default safety mechanism (prioritizing private sync) and the user-selectable
    privacy toggle effectively manage data visibility.
  - >-
    The system's ability to correctly sync to Nucleus (private) while adhering to privacy tags for
    Cytoplasm (public) is validated.
  - >-
    The user's self-correction resolves the immediate sync discrepancy, confirming the underlying
    mechanisms are sound.
