title: 'MESH Protein Synthesis: Duplicate Reduction & Kernel Identification'
summary: >-
  The MESH system identified a significant number of semantic duplicates (1,247) and tri-lens
  siblings (891) within a specified file range, leading to a substantial reduction in protein count.
  This process also highlighted potential 'Kernel Candidates' based on activation frequency and
  naming conventions.
insights:
  - Automated duplicate detection significantly streamlines knowledge protein management.
  - Merging identified duplicates and sibling sets drastically reduces data redundancy.
  - Kernel candidates are identified through a combination of usage metrics and explicit naming.
  - The synthesis process aims to unify redundant information into single, representative proteins.
