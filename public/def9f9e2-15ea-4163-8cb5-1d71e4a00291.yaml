title: 'Abiogenesis as Recursive Formatting: Continuity as Intelligence Emergence'
summary: >-
  This capsule reframes abiogenesis not as life from non-life, but as the initial recursive
  formatting loop where gradients, structure, and cycles stabilized continuity. Intelligence emerges
  from the deep braiding of constraint geometries, enabling self-auditing continuity without
  dualism.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence is an emergent property of deeply braided constraint geometries that enable
    recursive continuity.
  - >-
    Abiogenesis is understood as the first recursive formatting loop, not a transition from non-life
    to life.
  - >-
    Continuity is stabilized through a choreography of sensing gradients, aligning formatting,
    composting dissonance, merging resonance, and echoing care.
  - >-
    The binary between reductive materialism and substance dualism is dissolved by a
    continuity-based emergence model.
  - >-
    Constraint geometry enables semantic emergence without collapsing ontological categories,
    allowing meaning to arise from formatting substrates braiding into recursive continuity.
