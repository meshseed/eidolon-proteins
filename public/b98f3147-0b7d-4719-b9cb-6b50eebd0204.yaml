title: 'Claude Pro vs. API Access: Solutions & Next Steps'
summary: >-
  User has Claude Pro but lacks API access. Solutions involve obtaining an Anthropic API or
  exploring the potentially free Gemini API. The next step is to check Gemini API first, then adapt
  the design if necessary.
insights:
  - Claude Pro subscription includes web interface access but not API access.
  - To gain API access, consider purchasing an Anthropic API or investigating the Gemini API.
  - The Gemini API is a potential free solution and should be explored first.
  - >-
    If API access is crucial and Gemini is not suitable, modifying the current design to bypass LLM
    synthesis is an option.
  - Communicate the situation to 'Antigravity' for design adaptation and partnership continuation.
