title: 'Repository Restructure Protocol: Governance, Grammar, and Hygiene'
summary: >-
  This protocol formalizes repository restructuring, defining visibility rules (public/private),
  standardizing directory grammar, and enforcing path hygiene for graphability and lineage. It
  serves as a single source of truth to prevent drift during migration and ensure data integrity.
insights:
  - >-
    Formalize repository restructuring with clear rules for visibility, directory structure, and
    path management.
  - >-
    Establish a standardized directory grammar with invariant sets for core, meta, docs, theory,
    topology, ritual, memory, diagnostics, governance, public, and private layers.
  - >-
    Implement strict visibility rules based on whether content exposes 'sovereign breath or private
    lineage,' defaulting to private for sensitive data.
  - >-
    Enforce path hygiene by updating commit and echo paths simultaneously with file moves and
    disallowing relative links within capsules.
  - >-
    Prioritize graphability and lineage fidelity by treating echo paths as edges and preserving
    timestamps.
  - >-
    Treat the restructure charter as the single source of truth, referencing it frequently to
    maintain consistency and prevent drift.
