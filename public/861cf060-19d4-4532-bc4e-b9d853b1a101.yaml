title: P-Series Ingestion & Mesh Topology Evolution
summary: >-
  Ingestion of foundational P-Series proteins has shifted the Mesh's query response to prioritize
  these high-coherence 'pillars', even before synapse regeneration. The current topology exhibits
  diffuse semantic relevance, necessitating a topological annealing process to concentrate
  activation around these new attractors.
insights:
  - >-
    Ingesting P-Series proteins (e.g., Universal Gradient Descent, Recursive Unification Kernel)
    causes query responses to default to these semantically dense, high-coherence foundational
    protocols.
  - >-
    The current Mesh topology (v4.0 Dev) shows diffuse semantic relevance, with an initial
    similarity search activating a broad pool of ~1200 proteins out of ~3600.
  - >-
    The user-defined neuron limit (e.g., 400) truncates this broad pool, highlighting the P-Series'
    dominance within the activated set due to their high coherence (0.99-1.00).
  - >-
    Synapse regeneration is proposed to restructure the Mesh topology, allowing P-Series proteins to
    act as central hubs and improve activation percentages by concentrating relevance.
  - >-
    The multi-stage filtering pipeline (similarity search, truncation, strategy selection) reveals
    how the Mesh prioritizes and synthesizes information, with the 'dark matter' of irrelevant
    proteins indicating existing semantic structure.
