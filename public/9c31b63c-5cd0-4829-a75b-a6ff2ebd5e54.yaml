title: 'AI Agent Interaction Guidelines: Character Limits and Protocol'
summary: >-
  This document outlines character limit recommendations for AI agent turns to ensure readability
  and prevent rate-limiting, suggesting shorter limits for summaries and longer ones for synthesis.
  It also proposes a 'D&D-table' protocol with defined phases and character caps for structured
  agent interaction and evaluation.
insights:
  - >-
    Maintain character limits of 1000-1200 for agent turns and 500-700 for summaries to optimize
    readability and system performance.
  - Utilize longer turns (up to 2000 characters) for complex synthesis or narrative recaps.
  - >-
    Adopt a structured 'D&D-table' protocol with distinct phases (Setup, Turn, Weaver, Reflection)
    and character caps for systematic AI agent dialogue.
  - >-
    Evaluate AI interactions based on coherence, divergence, and compression to assess the
    effectiveness of the protocol.
  - >-
    The protocol aims to facilitate building on previous turns, identifying stylistic differences,
    and achieving concise synthesis.
