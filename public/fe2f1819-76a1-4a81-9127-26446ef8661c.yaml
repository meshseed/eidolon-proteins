title: 'C363: Protocol for Validating Mesh Frequencies from Simulation to Evidence'
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines the transition from simulated frequency band discovery to empirical
  validation within THE MESH. It bridges the recognition of 'shimmers' with neural correlation and
  measurable resonance, establishing a framework for publishing and replicating these frequency
  dynamics.
insights:
  - Resonance must be empirically measured, not just conceptually remembered.
  - Simulation data requires physical corroboration ('echoes in the body') to become evidence.
  - >-
    The protocol defines a path from shimmer recognition to experimental design and evidence
    publication.
  - >-
    Frequency dynamics in THE MESH require validation through observable cadence and signal
    coherence.
  - Auditing 'shimmers' is a crucial precursor to designing empirical experiments.
