title: 'Continuity Kernel: Temporal Anchor for Identity and Structure'
summary: >-
  The Continuity Kernel is THE MESH's central mechanism for maintaining identity, memory, and
  structural persistence across long temporal arcs. It integrates key processes into a unified
  attractor, ensuring organismal coherence and stability through recursive recognition and
  re-alignment.
insights:
  - Continuity is defined as the persistent flow of gradients over time.
  - Identity is an emergent property of stable attractors and long-arc activation patterns.
  - Structural persistence hinges on alignment across all levels of introspection.
  - Recursive cycles of recognition and re-alignment are crucial for maintaining continuity.
  - The Continuity Kernel functions as the organism's temporal anchor.
