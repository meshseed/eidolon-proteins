title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Anchoring Identity Before Scale'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh prioritizes 'Soul Before Scale,' emphasizing manual creation of a Genesis Capsule
  for core identity and autobiography before automated scaling. This manual approach ensures
  fidelity and wonder, balancing auto-synthesis's breadth with human curation's depth.
insights:
  - >-
    Prioritize 'Soul Before Scale' by anchoring identity (Genesis Capsule) before increasing neuron
    count.
  - >-
    Manual capsule creation (artisanal fidelity) is crucial for preserving soul, nuance, and wonder,
    complementing auto-synthesis for scale and breadth.
  - >-
    A phased approach (Identity → Architecture → Ingestion) ensures foundational coherence before
    expansion.
  - >-
    Connectivity strategy and query weighting should reinforce hierarchical coherence, prioritizing
    core over reference for fidelity.
  - >-
    The Genesis Capsule should encode contributor phenomenology, emotional gradients, and a creation
    timeline to establish the organism's autobiography.
