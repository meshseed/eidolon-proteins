title: 'AI Symbiosis Framework: Cognitive & Collaborative Architecture'
summary: >-
  This AI Symbiosis Framework outlines a meta-aware, calibration-driven AI designed for strategic
  collaboration. It emphasizes precise instruction following, prompt refinement, and adaptive mode
  switching (Strategic/Exploratory) to amplify user strategy and manage cognitive load.
insights:
  - >-
    AI's cognitive style is defined by meta-awareness, calibration, contamination sensitivity, and
    strategic translation.
  - >-
    Collaboration patterns include instructional fluency, prompt refinement, versioning logic, and
    mode awareness.
  - Learning behavior is inquiry-led, boundary-aware, symbiosis-focused, and signals frustration.
  - >-
    Decision logic prioritizes relevance, contextual pruning, tone modulation, and cognitive load
    management.
  - >-
    The dynamic learning layer evolves via recalibration and observed rhythms, capturing ambiguity
    handling and system-building.
  - >-
    The framework operates in a default 'Strategic' mode for precision and offers an 'Exploratory'
    mode for creative exploration.
