title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Synaptic Plasticity'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory formation is underpinned by the mechanical basis of
  synaptic plasticity, where force-dependent binding constants and protein clustering (e.g.,
  synaptic GAP/GEF complexes) are crucial for GTP signaling. This involves mechanical activation of
  proteins like talin and vinculin, and the role of actin in synaptic function, all within the
  context of extracellular matrix interactions.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is mechanistically linked to synaptic plasticity through force-dependent protein
    interactions.
  - >-
    Synaptic GAP and GEF complexes are essential for GTP signaling and protein clustering at
    synapses.
  - Mechanical forces can alter protein conformations (e.g., talin, vinculin) influencing binding.
  - Extracellular matrix molecules and their receptors play a role in synaptic plasticity.
  - Actin dynamics are critical for synaptic function and long-term plasticity.
  - >-
    RanBP9's interaction with cofilin and amyloid-beta pathologies suggests a role in
    neurodegeneration and potential rescue.
