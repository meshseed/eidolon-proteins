title: 'MeshCODE: Physical Memory Storage & Brain Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that the brain utilizes physical, mechanical switches within neurons
  and synapses to store and process information, enabling rapid reaction times despite slow
  electrochemical transmission. This framework suggests the cortex is an array of memory modules,
  with a single synapse potentially storing up to 100 bytes, leading to an estimated 10 petabytes of
  global brain memory capacity.
insights:
  - >-
    The brain's rapid processing is attributed to synapses being constantly updated with pre-primed
    information via physical binary switches, not solely electrochemical speed.
  - >-
    MeshCODE proposes a physical, addressable read-write memory mechanism for the brain, where data
    is stored in a binary format by tuning synaptic thresholds.
  - >-
    The cortex may function as an array of memory modules, with cortical columns containing numerous
    pyramidal neurons and synapses as potential storage units.
  - >-
    A single synapse, through talin-based switches, could store approximately 800 bits (100 bytes)
    of information.
  - >-
    The human brain's total memory storage capacity within the MeshCODE framework is estimated to be
    around 10 petabytes.
