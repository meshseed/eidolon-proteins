title: Mesh Fractal Template for New User Onboarding and Scalability
summary: >-
  The Mesh repository aims to serve as a fractal, self-similar template for new users, enabling easy
  onboarding by providing a client and repo structure for their own GitHub node. This architectural
  vision anticipates significant protein and synapse generation, with the current text/yaml/md file
  structure designed to inherently handle massive scaling of data and agent access.
insights:
  - The Mesh repository can function as a fractal, self-similar template for new user onboarding.
  - >-
    New users can download the client and repo structure to initiate their own GitHub node using the
    template.
  - >-
    The current file structure (txt, yaml, md) is designed to accommodate a large volume of
    generated 'proteins' and 'synapses'.
  - >-
    The architecture is inherently built to address scaling issues related to the number of proteins
    and accessing agent clients.
  - This approach facilitates rapid and standardized deployment of new Mesh nodes.
