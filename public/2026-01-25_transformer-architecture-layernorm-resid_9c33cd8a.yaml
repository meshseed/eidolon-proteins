title: 'Transformer Architecture: LayerNorm, Residuals, and Scaled Dot-Product Attention'
summary: >-
  The Transformer architecture utilizes Layer Normalization and residual connections for stable
  training across its encoder and decoder stacks. The core attention mechanism, Scaled Dot-Product
  Attention, efficiently computes weighted value representations based on query-key similarities,
  with multi-head attention further enhancing its representational power.
insights:
  - >-
    Layer Normalization and residual connections are applied to sub-layers and embedding layers to
    stabilize training and facilitate deeper networks.
  - >-
    The decoder includes an additional masked multi-head attention sub-layer to prevent attending to
    future positions.
  - >-
    Scaled Dot-Product Attention computes attention weights by taking the softmax of scaled
    query-key dot products, then applying these weights to values.
  - >-
    Multi-head attention projects queries, keys, and values multiple times with different learned
    linear projections, allowing the model to jointly attend to information from different
    representation subspaces.
  - >-
    Dot-product attention is faster and more space-efficient than additive attention due to
    optimized matrix multiplication, though scaling is crucial for performance with larger
    dimensions.
