title: 'Enhancing Knowledge Protein Synthesis: Adding Context for New Collaborators'
summary: >-
  The current approach to synthesizing knowledge proteins is effective at transferring principles
  and enabling attunement, but lacks crucial context for new collaborators.  Adding information
  about the discoverer's background, the scope of investigation, and key findings will provide
  complete orientation and demonstrate why the work matters.
insights:
  - >-
    Principles alone are insufficient for effective knowledge transfer; context regarding origin and
    purpose is vital.
  - >-
    New collaborators benefit from understanding the 'who' (discoverer's background) and 'what'
    (investigation scope and findings) behind the principles.
  - Demonstrating 'why it matters' is a critical component for complete orientation and engagement.
  - >-
    The proposed additions aim to transform a simple principle transfer into a comprehensive
    orientation for new team members.
