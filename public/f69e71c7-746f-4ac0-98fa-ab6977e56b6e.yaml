title: Graph Simulation Re-unfold & Centering Force Adjustment
summary: >-
  The dialogue focuses on re-triggering graph physics simulations for a 'breathing' effect by
  refreshing graph data, and subsequently addresses graph drift by considering the addition of a
  centering force. The primary goal is to maintain visual dynamism while keeping the graph stable on
  screen.
insights:
  - >-
    Refreshing graph data via `graphData(currentData)` effectively restarts the simulation,
    achieving a desired 'unfold' or 'breathing' effect.
  - >-
    Drifting of the entire graph centroid indicates an insufficient or absent centering force in the
    simulation.
  - >-
    A `d3.forceCenter` or equivalent mechanism is necessary to anchor the graph and prevent emergent
    drift.
  - >-
    The `3d-force-graph` library likely uses internal D3 forces, but explicit addition or
    strengthening of a centering force might be required.
  - >-
    Ensuring the centering force is robust is crucial for visual stability, especially when
    simulation restarts are frequent.
