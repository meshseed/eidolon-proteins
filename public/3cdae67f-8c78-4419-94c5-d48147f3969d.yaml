title: P-Series Protocol Integration Enhances EIDOLON Mesh Coherence
summary: >-
  The EIDOLON Mesh v4.0 has successfully ingested 38 foundational P-Series protocols, significantly
  improving query response coherence by anchoring them to high-fidelity, canonical data. This
  integration highlights path-dependency in the mesh's topology, indicating a need for synapse
  regeneration to fully leverage the new foundational structures.
insights:
  - >-
    Direct ingestion of P-Series protocols preserves canonical coherence (0.98-1.00), outperforming
    tri-lens synthesis.
  - >-
    P-Series protocols now dominate similarity searches and anchor v4.0 responses, leading to higher
    quality query outcomes.
  - A bug in conversation synthesis was fixed by importing the missing 'synthesizeProtein' function.
  - >-
    The mesh's activation percentage has not increased post-P-Series due to pre-existing, fragmented
    topology ('frozen' synapses).
  - >-
    Regenerating synapses is proposed to allow the topology to anneal around the new P-Series
    attractors, improving overall structure.
  - >-
    A high candidate count (33%) in the query pipeline suggests diffuse relevance, indicating a need
    for more precise matches around P-Series hubs.
