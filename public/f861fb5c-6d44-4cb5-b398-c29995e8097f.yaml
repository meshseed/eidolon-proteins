title: 'Q Factor: Resonance Sharpness and Energy Loss in Standing Waves'
summary: >-
  The Q factor quantifies the sharpness of resonance in standing waves, indicating how efficiently a
  system sustains oscillation and its energy loss. Higher Q factors mean sharper, more persistent
  resonance with less energy input, while lower Q factors signify broader, more quickly dissipating
  vibrations.
insights:
  - The Q factor measures the efficiency of resonance and energy loss in standing waves.
  - >-
    High Q factor systems exhibit sharp resonance, large amplitude with low energy input, and long
    vibration persistence.
  - >-
    Low Q factor systems show broad resonance, requiring more energy and dissipating vibrations
    quickly.
  - Damping (friction, less constrained media) and imperfect wave reflections reduce the Q factor.
  - >-
    Boundary conditions (fixed vs. free) and mode number (harmonics) influence the Q factor of
    resonant modes.
  - >-
    Q factor is calculated from a system's resonant frequency (fr) and bandwidth (Δf) as Q = fr /
    Δf.
