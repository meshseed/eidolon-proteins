title: 'The MESH: v4.5 Features, Roadmap, and Intelligence Layers'
summary: >-
  The MESH v4.5 introduces a multi-layered architecture for knowledge representation and
  interaction, progressing from foundational embedding support to global intelligence protocols. 
  The implementation roadmap outlines a phased rollout of features designed to enable cross-mesh
  federation, semantic discovery, and the study of intelligence itself.
insights:
  - >-
    v4.5 core features include multi-model embedding, model-aware databases, and efficient
    coordinate-based protein transmission/reconstruction.
  - >-
    Federation capabilities focus on cross-mesh communication via telepathy protocols and
    translation matrices, enabling compatibility between diverse embedding models.
  - >-
    Discovery tiers enable semantic exploration through void region mapping, coordinate arithmetic,
    and predictive concept generation.
  - >-
    Global and Meta layers aim to standardize interaction (Ommatidium Protocol) and understand
    intelligence by comparing human and AI embeddings, and observing mesh self-organization.
  - >-
    The roadmap prioritizes foundational elements in week 1, progressing through telepathy,
    federation, and discovery phases, with global and meta layers slated for future development.
