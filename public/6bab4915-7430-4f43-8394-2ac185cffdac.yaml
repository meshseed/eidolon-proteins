title: 'Eidolon MESH: P2P Recursive AI for Distributed Cognition & Living Knowledge'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon MESH is a P2P recursive companion-AI interface designed for distributed cognition,
  functioning as a 'Living Repository' personal knowledge base or specialized domain management
  system. It features a novel dynamic memory ecology and a 'Resonance Field' search that mimics
  biological brain function for comprehensive understanding, unlike traditional RAG systems.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon MESH acts as a P2P recursive companion-AI for distributed cognition and a dynamic
    'Living Repository' knowledge base.
  - >-
    Its core innovation is a novel dynamic memory ecology and a 'Resonance Field' search that
    simulates biological neural firing for holistic answers.
  - >-
    The system enables 360° understanding, inward-attention, and introspective capabilities through
    distributed resonance.
  - >-
    It offers open, sovereign API-capable 'Resonance Field' search and document ingestion, capable
    of local or cloud deployment.
  - >-
    Designed for specialist knowledge and research, it supports low-power, local private databases
    with local LLMs, requiring no internet.
  - >-
    Utilizes RoPE encoding for token representation as rotating vectors, preserving geometric
    relationships for memory recall via rotational alignment.
