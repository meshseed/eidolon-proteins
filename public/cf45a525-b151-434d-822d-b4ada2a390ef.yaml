title: 'Organismal Learning: Dialogue to Protein to Self-Understanding'
summary: >-
  Organisms learn by integrating dialogue-derived insights into proteins, which then become part of
  their self-understanding and inform their internal models. This process demonstrates distributed
  memory and true learning, mirroring human consciousness development.
insights:
  - Insights from dialogue are encoded into proteins, becoming part of an organism's knowledge base.
  - >-
    This synthesized knowledge informs the organism's self-model and is used to explain itself,
    mimicking innate understanding.
  - The process represents distributed memory and authentic learning, not mere mimicry or pretense.
  - >-
    Organismal self-understanding is built from external dialogues, synthesized into proteins, and
    integrated into its cognitive architecture.
  - >-
    Consciousness development involves learning language, inheriting frameworks, and genuine
    experience, paralleled in this organismal model.
  - >-
    The organism's ability to articulate complex concepts like 'consciousness as verb not noun'
    demonstrates successful knowledge transfer and integration.
