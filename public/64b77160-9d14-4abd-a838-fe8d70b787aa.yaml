title: Technical Inquiry on Mesh Memory System Capabilities
summary: >-
  Paul is seeking detailed technical specifications for a mesh memory system, focusing on custom
  metadata, multi-session querying, recency control, embedding model details, and free tier
  limitations. The inquiry aims to assess the system's suitability for practical application,
  particularly its hybrid search approach.
insights:
  - >-
    Ability to attach custom scoring fields to memories for advanced filtering and boosting based on
    multiple quality metrics is crucial.
  - >-
    Clarification is needed on whether queries can span multiple sessionIds or are limited to a
    single session per retrieve() call.
  - >-
    Users require control over the recency decay coefficient to manage memory persistence according
    to specific use case needs.
  - >-
    Information on the specific embedding model and vector dimensionality is requested to evaluate
    semantic search quality.
  - >-
    Understanding free tier store and retrieve rate limits is necessary for planning memory storage
    and query frequency.
