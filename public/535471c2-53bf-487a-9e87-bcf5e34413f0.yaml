title: 'The MESH: Unified Intelligence Architecture & Roadmap'
summary: >-
  The MESH is an evolving architecture for unified intelligence, encompassing multi-model
  embeddings, cross-mesh federation, semantic discovery, global coordination, and meta-intelligence
  understanding.  Its v4.5 roadmap outlines a phased implementation from foundational core features
  to advanced global protocols.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH integrates diverse AI models through multi-model embedding support and a model-aware
    database.
  - >-
    Federation capabilities enable cross-mesh communication and compatibility via coordinate
    telepathy and translation matrices.
  - >-
    Discovery features unlock semantic exploration through void region mapping and concept
    arithmetic.
  - >-
    Global protocols standardize interaction and enable distributed triangulation for collective
    intelligence.
  - >-
    Meta-intelligence tiers explore fundamental aspects of intelligence, comparing biological and
    silicon forms.
  - >-
    The v4.5 roadmap details a phased implementation over 5 weeks, prioritizing core functionality
    and federation.
