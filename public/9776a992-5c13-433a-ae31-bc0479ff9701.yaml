title: 'Curvature Diagnostics: Semantic Tension and Synthesis Pressure'
summary: >-
  Curvature Diagnostics identifies high-curvature regions as zones of intersecting semantic
  directions, indicating conceptual tension or synthesis pressure. This protocol treats curvature as
  a measurable property of semantic density and gradient interference, supporting targeted
  refinement.
insights:
  - High curvature signifies conceptual tension or unresolved synthesis.
  - Curvature arises at the intersection of emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Boundary surfaces highlight areas requiring integration between domains.
  - Curvature diagnostics enable precise refinement and pruning of knowledge.
  - Curvature maps are dynamic and evolve with new information.
