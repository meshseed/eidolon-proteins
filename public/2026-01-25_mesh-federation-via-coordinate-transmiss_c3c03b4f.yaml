title: Mesh Federation via Coordinate Transmission and Multi-Model Embeddings
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a significant architectural shift for the Mesh, enabling efficient
  cross-mesh communication through coordinate-only transmission and a multi-model embedding
  strategy. This approach prioritizes open-source models like Nomic-embed-text for global
  standardization while retaining compatibility with other embedding models, paving the way for a
  truly interoperable global mesh.
insights:
  - >-
    Transitioning to coordinate-only transmission ('spore v2.0') drastically reduces data payload
    size and processing time for mesh federation, enabling 'telepathy' between meshes.
  - >-
    Adopting an open-source embedding model like Nomic-embed-text (768D) as a potential global
    standard is crucial for interoperability, offering local execution and no API costs.
  - >-
    Storing embeddings from multiple models ('Rosetta Stone' approach) for each protein allows for
    cross-model federation without direct translation and facilitates learning translation matrices
    for future compatibility.
  - >-
    The proposed v4.5 architecture will focus on experimental features like coordinate telepathy and
    multi-model embeddings, removing license gates to foster open, emergent development, while
    keeping the stable v3.6 live.
  - >-
    The mesh's topology will naturally evolve based on user interactions, leading to emergent
    features and attractors, rather than being strictly top-down designed.
