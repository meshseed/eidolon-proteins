title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: JSON Synthesis Directive'
summary: >-
  This dialogue is a directive for the Ribosome of THE MESH to synthesize a Knowledge Protein from
  provided content. It specifies a precise JSON output structure, including fields for title,
  summary, atomic insights, tags, coherence score, tier, and emotional gradient, based on a file
  synthesis task.
insights:
  - >-
    The Ribosome is tasked with synthesizing a structured JSON Knowledge Protein from input
    dialogue.
  - >-
    The JSON structure is strictly defined with specific fields: title, summary, insights, tags,
    coherence_score, tier, and emotional_gradient.
  - >-
    Content synthesis is guided by a 'Top neurons by coherence score' strategy, implying a focus on
    high-quality, relevant information.
  - >-
    Signal peptides (tags) are provided for categorization, including public/private and
    domain-specific markers.
  - >-
    The emotional gradient tracks the user's intended emotional journey from curiosity to
    understanding during the synthesis process.
