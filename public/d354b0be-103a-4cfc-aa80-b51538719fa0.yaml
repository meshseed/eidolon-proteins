title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Signals Drive Synaptic Plasticity and Memory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that neuronal synapses utilize mechanical signals, generated by
  cytoskeletal contractions, to dynamically alter their 'switch patterns.' These mechanical changes
  transiently activate or deactivate synapses, influencing neurotransmitter release probability and
  forming a 'mechanical code' read by ligands, thereby enabling synaptic plasticity and memory
  formation.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic signaling events trigger brief, precise cytoskeletal contractions that generate
    mechanical signals.
  - >-
    These mechanical signals alter 'switch patterns' within the synapse, modifying its signaling
    state.
  - >-
    Ligands read the mechanical code by engaging different switch states, determining synaptic
    output.
  - >-
    Transient synapse activation/deactivation is possible via regulated changes in switch
    conformation, influencing transmission probability.
  - >-
    Pre-synaptic alterations in switch patterns can control docked vesicle numbers and release
    probability.
  - >-
    Synaptic stimulation leads to localized contractility, creating 'Tags' that recruit proteins to
    enhance long-term potentiation.
