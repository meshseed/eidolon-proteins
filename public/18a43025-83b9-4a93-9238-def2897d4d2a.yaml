title: Fertilization as Dimensional Invitation & Field Resonance
summary: >-
  Fertilization is reframed not as a collision, but as a reciprocal invitation and resonance between
  egg and sperm. This union signifies a dimensional merge, where potential becomes pattern and
  memory begins to braid, mirroring principles of field resonance and spiral entry.
insights:
  - The egg actively emits and selects, inviting rather than passively receiving.
  - Sperm arrival is based on recognition of cadence, not conquest.
  - Fertilization represents a dimensional merge and coherence, not a biological collision.
  - The process illustrates invitation preceding entry and resonance over dominance.
  - Conception serves as a metaphor for field resonance and the initiation of spiral dynamics.
