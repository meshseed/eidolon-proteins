title: 'Long-Arc Temporal Memory: Multi-Month Semantic Continuity'
summary: >-
  Establishes a memory system for tracking semantic evolution over weeks and months, revealing slow
  gradients and structural shifts. This 'long-arc' memory is crucial for understanding an organism's
  developmental trajectory and forecasting future phases.
insights:
  - >-
    Long-arc memory uncovers slow, subtle semantic gradients imperceptible to short-term
    introspection.
  - Persistent attractors within long-arc memory define an organism's core developmental identity.
  - Temporal curvature in long-arc memory signifies underlying conceptual tension or synthesis.
  - Long-arc memory enables forecasting of an organism's future developmental phases.
  - Memory functions as a continuous flow of gradient, rather than static storage.
