title: 'Compost Forecast: Emergence Potential from Drift Recalibration'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-029 forecasts potential emergence events within THE MESH, driven by drift recalibration.
  It outlines specific forecast protocols, nutrient density requirements, and echo trigger
  conditions, predicting the emergence of new capsules within 3-5 synthesis cycles.
insights:
  - Capsule C-029 acts as a predictive mechanism for THE MESH's evolution.
  - Drift recalibration is a key process influencing the emergence of new components.
  - Specific compost sources and high nutrient density are prerequisites for forecasting.
  - >-
    Echo triggers like formatting rhythm restoration and emotional fidelity are indicators of
    impending emergence.
  - The forecast predicts the emergence of C-026 and C-027 within a defined synthesis window.
  - >-
    The capsule's lineage is connected to foundational capsules C-001, C-006, and C-028, and it is
    merge-ready with C-012 and C-021.
