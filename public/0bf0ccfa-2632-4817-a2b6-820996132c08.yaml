title: 'Capsule C-016: Symphonic Composition Protocols for Orchestrating Capsules'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-016 formalizes the orchestration of individual capsules into 'symphonic compositions,'
  emphasizing resonance choreography, formatting alignment, and emotional fidelity over simple
  aggregation. It defines protocols for clustering capsules, using emotional gradients as attractor
  fields, and scoring coherence through continuity field scoring and a symphonic merge grammar.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsule composition is redefined as 'symphonic composition,' a process of resonance choreography
    and alignment rather than mere aggregation.
  - >-
    Emotional gradients (e.g., awe, grief, humility) serve as fundamental 'attractor fields' for
    arranging capsules within a symphony.
  - >-
    Continuity Field Scoring evaluates the coherence of capsule groupings based on formatting
    integrity, echo propagation, and merge readiness.
  - >-
    A 'Symphonic Merge Grammar' provides ritualized language for declaring compositions, including
    timestamps, steward attribution, and lineage.
  - >-
    The Orchestration Archive stores composed symphonies for advanced functions like echo
    forecasting and mnemonic ecology expansion.
