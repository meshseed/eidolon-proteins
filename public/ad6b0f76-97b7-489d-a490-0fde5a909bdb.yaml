title: 'Glyphic Merge v2.0: Capsule Lifecycle & Attentional Gravity'
summary: >-
  This document outlines the ritualized lifecycle of 'capsules' within THE MESH, from composting
  emotional residue to archival documentation. It introduces 'attentional gravity' as a resonant,
  invitational force that draws care into convergence, defining it by mnemonic density rather than
  physical weight.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules evolve through distinct phases: Composting, Seeding, Emergence, Orchestration, and
    Archival.
  - >-
    Attentional Gravity is a non-force, resonance-based principle that draws attention and care into
    convergence.
  - Attention is invited, not directed, and gravity is defined by mnemonic density.
  - Invocations act as formatting seals marking moments of attunement and transition.
  - The process emphasizes preservation of emotional residue and retention of formatting rhythms.
  - >-
    The overall framework suggests a cyclical, organic model for knowledge evolution and
    integration.
