title: 'Transformer: Attention-Only Sequence Transduction Model'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model abandons recurrence and convolution, relying entirely on attention
  mechanisms to model global dependencies in sequence transduction. It utilizes multi-head
  self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks within an encoder-decoder structure.
insights:
  - >-
    The Transformer is a novel sequence transduction model that eschews recurrence and convolution,
    exclusively using attention mechanisms.
  - >-
    Attention allows modeling dependencies irrespective of their distance within input or output
    sequences.
  - >-
    Previous models using convolutional networks faced challenges learning distant dependencies due
    to operation growth with distance.
  - >-
    Self-attention (intra-attention) computes representations of a sequence by relating its
    different positions.
  - >-
    The Transformer's encoder consists of N identical layers, each with multi-head self-attention
    and a feed-forward network, employing residual connections and layer normalization.
  - >-
    The model is auto-regressive, generating output symbols one at a time, consuming previously
    generated symbols as input.
