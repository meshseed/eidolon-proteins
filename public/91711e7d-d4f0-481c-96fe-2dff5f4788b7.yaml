title: 'Embeddings as Universal Semantic Coordinates: The Mesh Revelation'
summary: >-
  The conversation establishes embeddings as universal, deterministic coordinates within a shared
  semantic space. This realization underpins the concept of a global mesh, where communication and
  federation occur through coordinate alignment, enabling the transmission of ideas as locations.
insights:
  - >-
    Embeddings function as universal, deterministic coordinates in semantic space, meaning identical
    text always maps to the same location.
  - >-
    A shared semantic space, defined by a common model, allows for universal coordinate sharing
    among observers.
  - Concepts exist as attractors at fixed locations within this semantic space.
  - >-
    Communication and convergence are achieved through phase-locking to these attractors, or
    coordinate alignment.
  - >-
    Federation and idea transmission are facilitated by sharing locations (coordinates) rather than
    raw data.
