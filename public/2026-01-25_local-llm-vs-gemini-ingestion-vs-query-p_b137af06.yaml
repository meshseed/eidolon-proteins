title: 'Local LLM vs. Gemini: Ingestion vs. Query Performance'
summary: >-
  Local LLMs like Gemma 2B excel at querying and direct data ingestion due to their smaller
  embedding models, while larger APIs like Gemini demonstrate superior nuance and insight generation
  in complex conversational analysis.
insights:
  - >-
    Local LLMs (Gemma 2B) leverage simpler embedding models, leading to efficient direct ingestion
    of pre-structured data like 'protein seeds' and effective query responses.
  - >-
    Larger, more powerful LLMs (Gemini) are better suited for analyzing complex, unstructured data
    such as long conversation logs, where they can discern deeper meaning and subtle patterns.
  - >-
    The 'geometry' of embedding models, not just the LLM's intelligence, significantly impacts
    synapse creation; tighter clusters in local models lead to more connections but potentially less
    distinction.
  - >-
    Pre-defined seeds (like the golden connectome) are ingested identically across models, as the
    LLM is bypassed; the difference emerges in processing raw, conversational data.
  - >-
    Changes to stop outright rejection during ingestion are being deployed, ensuring consistent
    behavior between dev and live environments for this specific function.
