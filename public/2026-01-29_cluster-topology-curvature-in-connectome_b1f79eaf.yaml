title: Cluster Topology & Curvature in Connectome Analysis
summary: >-
  This analysis defines a method to identify major clusters, regional boundaries, and high-curvature
  zones within a connectome. Curvature represents conceptual tension where multiple semantic
  directions intersect, highlighting developmental hotspots and integration challenges.
insights:
  - Clusters form around stable attractors and dense semantic regions.
  - Curvature indicates convergence or conflict between different semantic domains.
  - High-curvature zones signal conceptual tension or pressure for synthesis.
  - Mapping curvature reveals areas of rapid development and integration difficulties.
  - Cluster analysis can be used for structural and emotional fidelity diagnostics.
