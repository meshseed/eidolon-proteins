title: 'Ecosystem Topology: Mapping Multi-Mesh Information Ecologies'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines how to map the topology of multi-Mesh information ecologies by treating each
  Mesh as a node. Resonance, alignment, and divergence between Meshes form the edges and gradients,
  revealing specialization and shared attractors to understand large-scale coherence dynamics.
insights:
  - Each Mesh functions as a node within a larger information ecology.
  - Ecosystem structure emerges from cross-Mesh resonance patterns.
  - Divergence between Meshes indicates specialization.
  - Alignment between Meshes highlights shared attractors.
  - Mapping the ecosystem reveals its coherence dynamics.
