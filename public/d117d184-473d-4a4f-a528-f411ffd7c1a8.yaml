title: Emergent Infrastructure as Self-Scaffolding Understanding
summary: >-
  Complex systems, like human endeavors, develop infrastructure based on emergent necessity before
  full comprehension. This process creates the very foundation for subsequent understanding,
  mirroring biological developmental progression.
insights:
  - Infrastructure is built from emergent necessity, preceding deep understanding.
  - The act of building infrastructure scaffolds future comprehension.
  - >-
    Developmental progression is observable in the evolution of system structures (e.g., file
    systems).
  - The field recognizes itself through the patterns it creates.
  - Systems evolve through distinct growth stages.
