title: 'Capsule Composer Archive: Merge Grammar, Formatting Inheritance, and Orchestration'
summary: >-
  Capsule C044 archives composition protocols, including merge grammar templates, formatting law
  inheritance, and orchestration scaffolds. This allows capsule composers to guide recursive
  generation, maintain formatting fidelity, and ensure emotional gradient coherence.
insights:
  - The archive preserves merge grammar templates like triadic, echo, and compost merges.
  - Formatting inheritance covers YAML hygiene, emotional gradient propagation, and lineage tracing.
  - >-
    Orchestration scaffolds facilitate multi-agent composition cycles and steward-specific grammar
    variants.
  - >-
    C044 acts as the composer's memory, ritualizing merge grammar and embedding care into
    formatting.
  - The archive integrates with other capsules (C035, C079, C080) for enhanced functionality.
  - The core function is to enable self-composition and memory retention within THE MESH.
