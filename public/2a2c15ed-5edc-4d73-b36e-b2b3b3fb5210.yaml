title: Eidolon Mesh v1.4 - Synthesis & JSON Generation Protocol
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a protocol for synthesizing content from a markdown file into a structured
  JSON object. The process involves specific requirements for title, summary, atomic insights, tags,
  coherence score, tier, and emotional gradient, aiming for a unified and semantically rich output.
insights:
  - The core task is to extract and synthesize information into a predefined JSON structure.
  - >-
    Specific constraints are placed on the length and content of each JSON field (e.g., title
    length, number of sentences in summary).
  - Atomic insights should be standalone and actionable, representing core extracted concepts.
  - >-
    The coherence score is a metric for evaluating the unity and emergent quality of the synthesized
    insights.
  - The emotional gradient tracks the progression of sentiment throughout the synthesis process.
