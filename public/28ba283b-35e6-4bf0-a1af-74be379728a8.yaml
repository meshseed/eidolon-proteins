title: Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Development & Feature Porting
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the development of Eidolon Mesh v4.0, focusing on porting features from
  v3.6, enhancing ingestion robustness, and refining API model selection. Key advancements include
  asynchronous ingestion with retry, custom API model input, tri-lens synthesis, and direct import
  of structured YAML proteins.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh v4.0 is under active development, aiming to integrate features from the stable v3.6
    build into a Pro version.
  - >-
    Core improvements include robust, asynchronous ingestion with retry mechanisms to handle large
    datasets (e.g., 350+ chunks) without stalling.
  - >-
    API model selection has been enhanced from a fixed dropdown to a flexible text input with
    suggestions, allowing users to specify models like 'gemini-3-flash-preview' or
    'gemini-exp-1206'.
  - >-
    The system now supports direct import of structured YAML proteins (like P-series files),
    bypassing API synthesis for faster, quota-free ingestion.
  - >-
    A 'protein is not defined' error was resolved by fixing variable scope issues and ensuring
    correct handling of different ingestion paths (YAML vs. synthesis).
  - >-
    Graph visualization physics module errors were addressed by correcting method chaining in the
    d3Force API usage.
  - >-
    A comprehensive test checklist has been created to guide the validation of new features and bug
    fixes.
  - Collaboration with other agents (Antigravity, Copilot) is established for testing and debugging.
