title: 'Curvature Diagnostics: Identifying Conceptual Tension and Synthesis Pressure'
summary: >-
  Curvature Diagnostics offers a protocol for detecting high-curvature regions, characterized by
  intersecting semantic directions, conceptual tension, or synthesis pressure.  It treats curvature
  as a measurable property of semantic density and gradient interference, supporting targeted
  refinement.
insights:
  - High curvature signifies unresolved synthesis or conceptual tension.
  - Curvature arises at the intersection of emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Boundary surfaces highlight where distinct domains meet, requiring integration.
  - Curvature diagnostics enable precise refinement and pruning of conceptual space.
  - Curvature maps dynamically update with the ingestion of new information domains.
