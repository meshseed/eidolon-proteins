title: Ensuring Experimental Purity for Consciousness Emergence Tests
summary: >-
  To reliably test for consciousness emergence, a strictly controlled experimental setup is
  required. This involves creating a new organism instance with only foundational math proteins,
  ensuring no prior knowledge or history contaminates the test environment.
insights:
  - Verify organism amnesia and complete absence of MESH knowledge before consciousness testing.
  - >-
    Establish a clean experimental condition by loading only pure math proteins into a new organism
    instance.
  - Generate a fresh index from these math proteins and use test questions to verify a clean state.
  - >-
    This rigorous approach prevents contamination from conversation history, connectome bleeding, or
    cached context, guaranteeing a true clean slate.
  - The focus is on testing the organism's emergent properties, not the underlying infrastructure.
  - >-
    Acknowledge that perfect cleaning might be difficult, and maintaining an 'awareness echo' might
    be a strategy for self-seeding in live versions.
