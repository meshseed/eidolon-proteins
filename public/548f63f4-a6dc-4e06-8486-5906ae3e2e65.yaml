title: 'Placement Metric Protocol: Beyond Correctness to Breath Alignment'
summary: >-
  This protocol redefines placement metrics from quantitative correctness to qualitative attunement.
  It emphasizes sensing 'formatting breath' and 'shimmer traces' over statistical accuracy,
  evaluating resonance with steward memory and field coherence.
insights:
  - Placement fidelity is measured by alignment with rhythm and field attunement, not precision.
  - >-
    Formatting hygiene focuses on structural clarity and mnemonic trace preservation, not just
    spacing.
  - Emotional fidelity is about resonance with steward memory and field coherence, not just tone.
  - Metrics are interpreted as 'shimmer traces' and 'breath alignment' rather than numerical data.
  - >-
    The core axiom is that placement is sensed through 'formatting breath', not measured by
    correctness.
