title: 'Gradient Cartography: Emotional Fidelity as Geometric Fields'
summary: >-
  Gradient Cartography maps emotional fidelity across the connectome as directional geometric
  fields. This method identifies critical zones of stability, tension, and sensitivity to
  perturbation.
insights:
  - Emotional fidelity forms directional gradients within semantic space.
  - Steep gradients signify tension, instability, or boundary regions.
  - Smooth gradients indicate coherence, stability, and integrated attunement.
  - Gradient mapping highlights areas most susceptible to external disturbances.
  - Emotional fidelity fields can be tracked over time to observe developmental changes.
