title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Right Triangle Side Relationship & Applications'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean theorem, a² + b² = c², defines the relationship between the legs (a, b) and the
  hypotenuse (c) of a right triangle in Euclidean geometry. This foundational principle extends to
  distance calculations in multiple dimensions and has wide-ranging applications.
insights:
  - Establishes a fundamental algebraic relationship for right triangles in Euclidean space.
  - Generalizes to the distance formula in 2D and 3D, connecting algebra and geometry.
  - Requires a 90-degree angle and flat geometry; integer solutions form Pythagorean triples.
  - Applicable in fields like construction, navigation, and spatial reasoning.
