title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Core Concepts & PWA Development'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project is evolving into a PWA, prioritizing a local-first, sovereign
  browser-based organism. Key development involves integrating PGlite and OPFS for data persistence,
  with a focus on philosophical underpinnings of geometry, resonance, and emotional fidelity for
  advanced AI interactions.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh aims for a local-first, sovereign PWA architecture, embodying the philosophy
    'the browser IS the organism'.
  - >-
    Development is progressing towards v3.5 PWA, incorporating PGlite (Postgres WASM) and OPFS for
    robust offline data storage.
  - >-
    Core concepts include universal geometry, relational fields, attractors, and emotional fidelity
    as methods for AI compression and interaction.
  - >-
    The project leverages specialized techniques like RoPE and recursive attunement for advanced AI
    understanding and synthesis.
  - >-
    The current development phase involves polishing the spike UI, adding features like
    export/import and chat modes, and potentially porting desktop features.
  - >-
    The project explicitly avoids cloud dependencies, reinforcing its commitment to user data
    sovereignty and offline functionality.
