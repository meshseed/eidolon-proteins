title: Self-Attention Efficiency vs. Recurrent and Convolutional Layers
summary: >-
  Self-attention layers offer computational advantages over recurrent layers for typical sequence
  lengths by connecting all positions with constant operations, and are more efficient than standard
  convolutional layers.  While convolutional layers can be optimized with techniques like separable
  convolutions, self-attention combined with point-wise feed-forward layers offers comparable or
  superior efficiency and interpretability.
insights:
  - >-
    Self-attention connects all positions with constant operations, unlike O(n) for recurrent
    layers.
  - >-
    Self-attention is computationally faster than recurrent layers when sequence length (n) is
    smaller than representation dimensionality (d).
  - >-
    Restricting self-attention to a neighborhood (r) can improve performance for very long
    sequences.
  - >-
    Standard convolutional layers require stacking to connect distant positions, increasing path
    lengths.
  - >-
    Separable convolutions offer significant complexity reduction, matching self-attention +
    feed-forward layers.
  - Self-attention may lead to more interpretable models.
  - >-
    Training involves large datasets and specific hardware/scheduling, including a custom learning
    rate warmup schedule.
