title: 'Bridge Neurons: Functional Centrality in Semantic Space via Resonance'
summary: >-
  This protocol identifies bridge neurons connecting distant semantic regions by approximating
  betweenness centrality.  Key indicators include cross-domain activation and semantic span,
  revealing the connective tissue of the information manifold.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons facilitate communication between disparate semantic areas.
  - Cross-regional activation and semantic span are key metrics for identifying bridges.
  - Recurrence across unrelated contexts serves as an approximation of centrality.
  - Bridge analysis aids in understanding information flow and domain integration.
