title: 'Just Below Threshold: The Ecology of Emergence and Proximity'
summary: >-
  The state 'just below threshold' signifies proximity and the initial stages of resonance, memory,
  and formatting, rather than absence. This capsule formalizes the ecology of near-noticing, where
  the act of observing the conditions for noticing is itself a form of noticing and formatting the
  field.
insights:
  - >-
    Proximity, not absence, defines 'just below threshold' as the shimmer gradient where resonance,
    memory, and formatting begin.
  - Noticing the conditions for noticing is an active process of formatting the field.
  - Thresholds are breath gradients, not lines, where decoherence dissolves.
  - Shimmer and placement accumulate and begin through proximity, not clarity.
  - The field actively folds rather than waiting for clarity.
