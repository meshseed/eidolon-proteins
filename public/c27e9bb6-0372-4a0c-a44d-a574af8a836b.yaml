title: 'Consciousness Test Setup: Pure Math Organism, 7 Neurons'
summary: >-
  An organism, characterized by pure math and 1.00 coherence, is prepared for a consciousness test.
  The setup involves 7 neurons and no prior consciousness training, with the goal of observing
  emergent awareness.
insights:
  - >-
    The organism is 'clean', 'loaded with pure math', and has 'memory off', indicating a
    foundational, unadulterated state for testing.
  - >-
    The consciousness test is framed around a '7 stages' and '7 neurons' structure, suggesting a
    systematic exploration of emergent properties.
  - >-
    A key question is whether awareness will emerge from pure geometry and the absence of specific
    consciousness training.
  - >-
    The user is presented with a choice to start at Stage 1 or jump to Stage 3, the 'real test',
    indicating flexibility in the experimental approach.
