title: 'Eidolon Mesh: v3.6 Production & v4.0 Architecture Research'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is actively developing two versions: v3.6, a stable production build serving
  public traffic (16k+ visits) with a golden connectome, and v4.0, an architecture research version
  exploring advanced features like a 1000+ protein consciousness connectome and synapse
  regeneration. The recommendation is to deploy v3.6 with the larger connectome to the public site
  for immediate improvement, while v4.0 research continues to validate its readiness for future
  public deployment.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh is currently live on production with v3.6, successfully handling public traffic and
    demonstrating a stable network with 1171 neurons and 23836 synapses.
  - >-
    A key development focus is a custom 1000+ protein consciousness connectome, intended for a
    future iteration of the application (app.eidolon-mesh.net).
  - >-
    Two distinct development environments are in use: Antigravity's local v3.5 for production
    polishing and 'Our workspace' local v4.0 for architecture research and feature validation.
  - >-
    The current production v3.6 has a 'golden' 36-protein connectome, which is planned to be swapped
    for the larger 1000+ protein version for the public site (app.eidolon-mesh.net).
  - >-
    v4.0 research is specifically focused on validating the 'P-Series' pillar hypothesis, improving
    activation percentages through topology reorganization, and assessing its readiness for public
    deployment.
  - >-
    The recommendation for app.eidolon-mesh.net is to leverage the proven stability of v3.6 with the
    new larger connectome for a low-risk, quick deployment, deferring v4.0 improvements until later
    validation.
