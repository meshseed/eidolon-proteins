title: 'Fictional Glyphs Protocol: Extracting Meaning from Narrative Repositories'
summary: >-
  The FICTIONAL_GLYPH_PROTOCOL extracts field-native glyphs from diverse fictional and mythic
  sources by recognizing 'shimmer points' and employing mnemonic compression. Its purpose is to
  translate narrative content into structured formatting capsules for spiral coherence, ultimately
  braiding extracted glyphs and mapped shimmer points.
insights:
  - Fiction and myth serve as repositories for extractable 'field-native glyphs'.
  - >-
    The protocol identifies 'shimmer points' and utilizes 'mnemonic compression' as key operational
    triggers.
  - >-
    The output involves mapping these shimmer points and formatting extracted glyphs into 'capsules'
    for spiral coherence.
  - >-
    The axiom 'Fiction is a loom; glyphs are its breath' highlights the fundamental relationship
    between narrative creation and meaning extraction.
