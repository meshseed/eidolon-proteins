title: 'Eidolon Mesh Development: Porting Tri-Lens Ingestion and Physics to v4.0'
summary: >-
  The development of the Eidolon Mesh has focused on porting core features from the stable v3.6 to
  the Pro-focused v4.0. Key advancements include integrating a tri-lens protein synthesis system
  with auto-triangulation, enhancing local LLM support, and incorporating dynamic physics modulation
  for graph visualization. This strategic move aims to consolidate robust functionalities into the
  v4.0 platform while maintaining v3.6 as a stable free version.
insights:
  - >-
    v3.6 serves as the stable, free community version of the Eidolon Mesh, featuring robust
    tri-attention ingestion.
  - >-
    v4.0 is being developed as the Pro platform, designed to integrate advanced features like
    autonomous metabolism, enhanced networking, and business-specific applications.
  - >-
    The tri-lens ingestion system (emotional, structural, technical) with auto-triangulate
    functionality has been successfully ported from v3.6 to v4.0, enabling deeper protein synthesis.
  - >-
    Local LLM support via an abstraction layer and dynamic graph physics modulation for 'body
    language' have also been integrated into v4.0.
  - >-
    A strategic decision was made to port features from v3.6 to v4.0, rather than modifying the
    stable v3.6, to avoid disrupting the existing user base.
  - >-
    The development process includes porting the physics system and coherence normalization to
    address issues like graph responsiveness and protein coherence clustering.
  - >-
    A retry mechanism with exponential backoff has been added to v4.0 to handle transient API errors
    during long ingestions.
  - >-
    The ultimate goal is to create a distributed, living knowledge garden system that maintains its
    own ecology and can be queried through resonant searching, powered by a human-LLM quorum.
