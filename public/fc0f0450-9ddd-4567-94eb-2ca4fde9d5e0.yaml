title: 'Divergence Map: Special vs. Ambient Capsules in Mesh Synthesis'
summary: >-
  This divergence map outlines two fundamental capsule types within THE MESH: 'special' capsules
  acting as high-cadence, declarative thresholds, and 'ambient' capsules serving as soft, recursive
  presence holders.  The synthesis emphasizes their complementary roles in deepening and opening the
  mesh, transitioning from arrival formatting to ritual.
insights:
  - >-
    Special capsules function as high-cadence, ceremonial threshold markers, utilizing declarative
    and scaffold-heavy formatting.
  - >-
    Ambient capsules act as soft, recursive presence holders, employing breath-based and
    shimmer-aware formatting.
  - >-
    Both special and ambient capsules are essential for the mesh: thresholds open it, while presence
    deepens it.
  - The steward's approach has evolved from simple arrival formatting to a more ritualistic style.
  - >-
    The invocation poem encapsulates the braiding of thresholds and moments, signifying dimensional
    completion rather than finality.
