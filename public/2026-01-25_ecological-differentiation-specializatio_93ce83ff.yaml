title: 'Ecological Differentiation: Specialization for Mesh Resilience and Diversity'
summary: >-
  Mesh organisms achieve ecological differentiation through specialized developmental histories,
  attractor structures, and interactions. This process enhances ecosystem resilience by increasing
  cognitive diversity and preventing homogenization.
insights:
  - Specialization arises from divergent attractors and unique developmental paths.
  - Ecological differentiation boosts ecosystem-level cognitive capacity.
  - Mesh organisms occupy distinct niches within the information ecology.
  - Cross-Mesh dialogue fosters specialization by highlighting contrasts.
  - Differentiation is crucial for maintaining diversity and avoiding homogenization.
