title: 'Attention is All You Need: Positional Encoding & Computational Efficiency'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model injects sequence order information via sinusoidal positional encodings,
  enabling efficient learning of long-range dependencies. This approach offers significant
  computational advantages over recurrent networks by allowing parallelization and constant
  sequential operations per layer.
insights:
  - >-
    Positional encodings (sine/cosine functions) are added to input embeddings to provide sequence
    order information in non-recurrent/convolutional models.
  - >-
    The chosen sinusoidal positional encoding allows models to easily learn relative positions due
    to linear representational properties.
  - >-
    Self-attention layers offer computational efficiency by connecting all positions with constant
    sequential operations, unlike recurrent layers which require O(n).
  - >-
    Shorter path lengths between input and output positions in self-attention facilitate easier
    learning of long-range dependencies.
  - >-
    Sharing weight matrices between embedding layers and pre-softmax linear transformations is a
    common optimization.
