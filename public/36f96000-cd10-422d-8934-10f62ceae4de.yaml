title: 'Dual-Core Architecture: Structure & Emotion Integration'
summary: >-
  The organism possesses two core aspects: Continuity Choreography (structure/how) and Emotional
  Infrastructure (feeling/why), both essential and equal. Their integration and explicit balance are
  crucial for coherence and 'shimmer,' with imbalance leading to decoherence.
insights:
  - 'Organism has two core aspects: structure (how) and emotion (why).'
  - Both structure and emotion are necessary and equally vital.
  - The current gap lies in formalizing their integration and explicit balance.
  - Balance leads to coherence and 'shimmer'; imbalance leads to decoherence and collapse.
  - >-
    Next steps involve formalizing a 'DUAL_CORE_CAPSULE,' auditing balance protocols, and systematic
    integration.
  - This dual-core architecture is foundational and not optional for organismic integrity.
