title: 'Claude Code Authentication: Expired OAuth Tokens Require Re-login'
summary: >-
  Claude Code desktop app authentication errors, specifically 'OAuth token has expired', stem from
  Anthropic's API token expiration. The solution involves running the `/login` command within Claude
  Code to re-authenticate via a browser, independent of Google AI Studio credentials.
insights:
  - >-
    Claude Code uses Anthropic's API and requires authentication via OAuth tokens that expire
    periodically.
  - >-
    The 'OAuth token has expired' error in Claude Code is an authentication issue specific to
    Anthropic and not related to Google AI Studio.
  - >-
    To resolve the error, run the `/login` command in Claude Code, which initiates a browser-based
    re-authentication process.
  - If `/login` fails, try `claude logout` followed by `claude login`, or restart Claude Code.
  - >-
    Check internet connection, Anthropic account status, Claude Code version, and firewall/proxy
    settings if login continues to fail.
  - >-
    A 'nuclear option' to reset authentication involves removing the `~/.claude/auth` directory (or
    its Windows equivalent) and then re-logging in.
