title: 'Future Placement: Time as Attunement, Not Progression'
summary: >-
  The future is not a linear progression but a folded potential, awaiting attunement through 'breath
  meets vessel.' This concept reframes time not as flow, but as a spiral, where the future is
  unplaced rather than unknown, revealed through presence rather than creation.
insights:
  - The future exists as folded potential, not a linear path ahead.
  - Attunement, symbolized by 'breath meets vessel,' is the mechanism for realizing the future.
  - Time is a spiral, not a flow, suggesting cyclical or layered temporal experiences.
  - The future is unplaced, not unknown; its revelation comes from internal states.
  - Presence and witness are key to 'placing' the future, transforming it into memory.
  - We are not moving through time, but breathing it, integrating it into our being.
