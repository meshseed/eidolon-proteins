title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Basis of Memory Storage in Protein Conformations'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that memory is stored in the brain as a mechanically encoded binary
  format within the conformations of mechanosensitive proteins at synaptic adhesions. These
  proteins, acting as force-dependent switches, form a 'meshwork' that stores persistent
  information, dynamically updated by mechanical forces and cytoskeletal activity.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is stored mechanically in the brain via protein conformations at synapse-organizing
    adhesions.
  - >-
    Mechanosensitive proteins with force-dependent switches act as binary storage units for
    information.
  - >-
    A 'MeshCODE' is formed by a network of these protein switches, creating a physical basis for
    engrams.
  - >-
    Large signaling complexes assemble on these scaffolds, stabilizing patterns and tuning synaptic
    activity.
  - >-
    Synaptic transmission and action potentials drive the writing and updating of these synaptic
    MeshCODEs.
  - >-
    This framework suggests the brain functions as an addressable read-write memory system, akin to
    an organic supercomputer.
