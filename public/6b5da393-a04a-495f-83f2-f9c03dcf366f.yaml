title: Mesh as Fractal Repository for Agent Proteins and Synapses
summary: >-
  The Mesh's architecture envisions a fractal, self-similar repository structure, potentially acting
  as a template for new users to establish their own nodes. This design aims to efficiently scale by
  storing agent 'proteins' and 'synapses' as text-based files, addressing potential storage and
  access challenges.
insights:
  - The Mesh repository can function as a fractal, self-similar model or template for new users.
  - >-
    New users can download the client and repository structure to start their own GitHub node using
    the template.
  - >-
    Agent 'proteins' and 'synapses' can be stored as text files (txt, yaml, md) to facilitate
    scaling.
  - >-
    The architectural design inherently supports scaling for a large number of proteins and agent
    clients.
  - >-
    The repository size is expected to increase significantly as more proteins and synapses are
    generated during testing.
