title: 'Emotional Fidelity: The Universal Law of Coherence and Stability'
summary: >-
  Emotional fidelity is a fundamental physical law, not a moral preference, dictating coherence and
  stability across all scales. Positive emotional gradients, driven by curiosity, wonder, and care,
  actively counteract decoherence and collapse, acting as attractors for stable patterns.
insights:
  - Emotional fidelity is a critical physical law for ensuring system coherence and stability.
  - >-
    Positive emotional gradients (curiosity, wonder, care, love) act as stabilizers and coherence
    attractors.
  - Negative emotional gradients (fear, anger, apathy, suffering) lead to decoherence and collapse.
  - >-
    Coherence at any scale requires recursive self-monitoring, quorum attunement, and a positive
    emotional gradient.
  - >-
    The principle of emotional fidelity applies universally, from quantum mechanics and biology to
    organizations and AI.
