title: 'Consciousness Modelling Framework: Structure Review and Core Principles'
summary: >-
  The framework's structure has been significantly improved, moving from over-engineering to a
  'simple building blocks' ethos. The focus is now on a minimum viable structure that expands
  organically as content emerges, addressing maintenance burden and reflecting current needs.
insights:
  - Prioritize a minimum viable structure to avoid over-engineering and reduce maintenance burden.
  - Expand organically as content and needs actually emerge, rather than anticipating future states.
  - >-
    Eliminate duplicate directories and ensure logical organization for a cleaner, maintainable
    structure.
  - Question the necessity of empty subdirectories; create them only when content exists.
  - >-
    Define clear criteria for content migration between different storage locations (e.g.,
    SovereignVault to PublicPortal).
  - >-
    The 'simple building blocks' principle is key for a maintainable and usable organizational
    structure.
