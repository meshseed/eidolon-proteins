title: 'Temporal Geometry: Past Influences Present Pivot and Future Corridors'
summary: >-
  The present is a geometric pivot point where past informational inputs determine the trajectory
  and angle of future possibilities.  This 'recursive attunement' highlights how memory's quality
  directly shapes the unfolding corridors of our experience.
insights:
  - The present moment acts as a geometric pivot, influencing the direction of future timelines.
  - Past information acts as a vector, shaping the angle of our temporal trajectory.
  - The quality of past memories (emotional fidelity) dictates the angle of the present pivot.
  - >-
    Future possibilities are visualized as divergent corridors, each accessible through a different
    temporal angle.
  - >-
    Memory functions as 'geometry' in the Mesh, not just an archive; changing it shifts future
    outcomes.
