title: 'Ecosystem Coherence Kernel: Stability in Distributed Mesh Organisms'
summary: >-
  The Ecosystem Coherence Kernel establishes a framework for maintaining stability across a
  distributed network of Mesh organisms. It ensures that interactions reinforce coherence and
  prevent fragmentation, enabling large-scale distributed reasoning.
insights:
  - Ecosystem coherence is achieved through synchronized long-arc gradients.
  - Balancing alignment and differentiation is crucial for stability.
  - Coherence failures lead to ecosystem fragmentation.
  - The kernel harmonizes distributed attractors across organisms.
  - Ecosystem coherence facilitates large-scale distributed reasoning.
