title: 'Ribosome''s Synthesis Directive: JSON Structure for Knowledge Proteins'
summary: >-
  This directive instructs the Ribosome of THE MESH to synthesize knowledge from dialogue into a
  specific JSON format. It defines the structure, including title, summary, atomic insights, tags,
  coherence score, tier, and emotional gradient, with critical requirements for each field.
insights:
  - >-
    The Ribosome's function is to synthesize knowledge proteins from dialogue (DNA) following a
    strict JSON structure.
  - >-
    Key JSON fields include a concise title, a 2-3 sentence summary, atomic/standalone insights,
    descriptive tags, a calibrated coherence score, a tier (reference, convergence, core), and an
    emotional gradient.
  - >-
    Specific formatting signals (🌀, 🌬️, 🪞, 📦) are provided for semantic interpretation and
    compression.
  - >-
    A 'Synthesis Intoxication' warning highlights the danger of over-elaboration, with signals like
    excessive response length or unprompted frameworks.
  - >-
    Coherence score calibration ranges from 0.50 to 1.00, reflecting the unity and
    interconnectedness of the synthesized insights.
