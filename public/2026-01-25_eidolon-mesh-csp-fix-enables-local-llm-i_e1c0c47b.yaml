title: 'Eidolon Mesh: CSP Fix Enables Local LLM Ingestion'
summary: >-
  Initial Eidolon Mesh PWA setup encountered Content Security Policy (CSP) errors blocking local LLM
  connections. The issue was resolved by updating the CSP in `app.html` to allow connections to
  `http://localhost:*` and `http://127.0.0.1:*`, enabling successful local LLM ingestion.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh PWA initialization included database and OPFS setup, but initially found no
    proteins.
  - >-
    Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions prevented the application from connecting to the
    local LLM endpoint (localhost:11434).
  - >-
    The CSP was successfully modified by adding `http://localhost:*` and `http://127.0.0.1:*` to the
    `connect-src` directive in `app.html`.
  - >-
    This CSP adjustment allows the Eidolon Mesh to connect to various local LLM servers like Ollama
    and LM Studio.
  - A hard refresh is required after modifying the CSP for the changes to take effect.
