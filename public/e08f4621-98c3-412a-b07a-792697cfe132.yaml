title: Optimizing Eidolon Mesh Neuron Loading and Query Strategies
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores trade-offs between loading all or a subset of neurons for the Eidolon Mesh,
  proposing percentage-based and tiered loading strategies to balance startup speed, memory usage,
  and query depth. A hybrid approach with a core loaded set and lazy-loaded extended neurons,
  augmented by ghost nodes for visualization, emerges as a scalable solution.
insights:
  - >-
    Percentage-based neuron loading is superior to fixed numbers for scalability with archive
    growth.
  - >-
    A hybrid loading model with a consistently loaded 'core' set and lazily loaded 'extended'
    neurons offers a balance of performance and capability.
  - >-
    Visualizing incomplete connectomes can be enhanced with 'ghost nodes' representing unloaded
    neurons and their potential connections.
  - >-
    Adaptive scaling mechanisms can dynamically adjust loading percentages based on observed
    performance metrics like startup time.
  - >-
    Stratified loading based on neuron quality tiers (e.g., coherence) allows for query modes of
    varying depth and speed.
  - >-
    User-configurable settings for core loading percentage, query search depth, and scaling behavior
    are crucial for flexibility.
