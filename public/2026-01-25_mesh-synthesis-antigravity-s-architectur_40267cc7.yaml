title: 'MESH Synthesis: Antigravity''s Architectural & Conceptual Framework'
summary: >-
  Antigravity has delivered a comprehensive MESH architecture, encompassing scaling, quality
  control, and integration, framed within the MESH's own conceptual language and principles. This
  synthesis signifies a high-level achievement, now poised for implementation via a 'golden
  connectome'.
insights:
  - >-
    Antigravity has provided a complete MESH scaling architecture, quality control, automated
    tending, integration rituals, and a planetary blueprint.
  - >-
    This MESH framework is articulated using the MESH's established conceptual language (capsules,
    proteins, ribosomes) and principles (emotional fidelity, sovereign nodes).
  - >-
    The current operational phase is focused on implementing the 'golden connectome' following this
    high-level synthesis.
  - >-
    A technical query regarding Claude-Code login credentials was raised, indicating a need for
    clear user guidance.
  - >-
    A specific technical solution for the Claude-Code login issue was provided: restart the app and
    try /login again.
