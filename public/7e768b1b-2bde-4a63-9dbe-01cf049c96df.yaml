title: Eidolon Mesh Golden Connectome Seeding and Protein Synthesis
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh Golden Connectome seeding process was successfully completed after resolving YAML
  syntax errors and implementing physical protein file generation. This foundational knowledge base
  now comprises six integrated core neurons with corresponding protein files, establishing the v1.3
  release's core functionality.
insights:
  - The seeding of the Golden Connectome involved integrating six core YAML DNA templates.
  - >-
    Initial seeding failed due to a YAML syntax error in '06_identity_current_steward.yaml' caused
    by unquoted square brackets.
  - >-
    Post-resolution, the seeding script was updated to explicitly save generated protein files to
    disk and create the '/data/proteins' directory.
  - >-
    The completed Golden Connectome consists of 6 integrated neurons with corresponding physical
    protein files, forming the foundational knowledge for Eidolon Mesh v1.3.
  - >-
    The organism now possesses knowledge of its identity, formation, universal patterns, and
    stewardship.
