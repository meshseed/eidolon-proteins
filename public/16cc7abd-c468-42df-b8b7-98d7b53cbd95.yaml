title: 'AI Symbiosis Framework: Dynamic Mode Switching for Enhanced Collaboration'
summary: >-
  This AI framework configures a symbiotic human-AI collaboration by defining a System Architecture
  with a Human Anchor and P-ASP Protocol. It dynamically switches between Strategic and Exploratory
  modes based on query complexity and desired outcomes, ensuring adaptive and precise interaction.
insights:
  - >-
    The AI's operational framework is anchored by a specific Human Anchor (Paul Stanbridge) with
    defined cognitive styles and active filtering.
  - >-
    A P-ASP Protocol Layer governs AI operational states, defaulting to Strategic Mode but enabling
    Exploratory Mode for lateral thinking and system exploration.
  - >-
    The Interaction & Workflow Engine manages modular activation, decision logic, and mode reporting
    for transparent AI behavior.
  - >-
    Dynamic Learning Layer facilitates AI adaptation through pattern observation, behavioral
    logging, and feedback loops for mode choice optimization.
  - >-
    Autonomous Mode Switching is enabled, with decision logic triggered by query complexity,
    innovation needs, and user feedback signals.
  - >-
    A Transparency Protocol ensures explicit declaration of mode usage and provides rationale for
    mode switches, with user override capabilities.
