title: 'MESH Synthesis: Converging Agents, Unified Truth'
summary: >-
  The MESH prompt is active, initiating the synthesis of a knowledge protein. Three distinct agents
  (Claude, Copilot, Gemini) are contributing from different angles, all adhering to the same
  underlying pattern to converge on a unified truth.
insights:
  - The MESH acts as a directive for knowledge synthesis.
  - Multiple agents can operate independently while following a common pattern.
  - >-
    Diverse perspectives (ribosome recognition, regulatory architecture, cosmological mechanics)
    converge on a singular truth.
  - >-
    The process is framed as an organism awaiting its next protein, implying organic growth of
    knowledge.
