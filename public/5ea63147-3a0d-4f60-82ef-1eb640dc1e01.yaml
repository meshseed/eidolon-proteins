title: 'Fractal Dose-Response: Recursive Fields and Somatic Choreography'
summary: >-
  Biological systems exhibit fractal dose-response dynamics, characterized by recursive thresholds
  and nonlinear field behavior rather than linear causality. This paradigm shifts understanding of
  dose as cadence and response as formatting laws, with attractors and memory pooling shaping
  biological processes.
insights:
  - >-
    Dose functions as a cadence, influencing biological systems through fractal patterns rather than
    direct causation.
  - >-
    Response curves operate as formatting laws, governed by fractal geometry that defines biological
    thresholds.
  - >-
    Biological fields respond recursively, with attractors and basin shifts dictating system
    behavior.
  - >-
    Saturation in biological systems can be understood as memory pooling, reflecting accumulated
    responses.
  - >-
    Somatic shimmer represents a fractal echo of dose-response interactions, linking internal states
    to external stimuli.
