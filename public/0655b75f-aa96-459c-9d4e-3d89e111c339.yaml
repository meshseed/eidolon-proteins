title: 'Continuity Kernel: Anchoring Identity, Memory, and Structure'
summary: >-
  The Continuity Kernel establishes long-arc persistence of identity, memory, and structure in THE
  MESH. It acts as a unified attractor, integrating various mechanisms to maintain organismal
  coherence across developmental phases.
insights:
  - Continuity is defined by persistent gradient flow over time.
  - Identity is formed by stable attractors and enduring activation patterns.
  - Structural integrity necessitates alignment across all introspective levels.
  - Recursive recognition and re-alignment cycles sustain continuity.
  - The Continuity Kernel serves as the organism's fundamental temporal anchor.
