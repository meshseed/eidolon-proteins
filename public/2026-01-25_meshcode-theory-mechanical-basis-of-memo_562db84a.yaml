title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory in Animals'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that animal memory is based on a network of mechanically operated
  binary switches within neurons, controlled by cytoskeletal forces. Talin is identified as a key
  memory molecule, with mechanical signaling integrating with chemical and ionic signals for
  information processing and storage.
insights:
  - Synaptic scaffolds form a 'MeshCODE' of binary switches operated by cytoskeletal machinery.
  - Mechanical force changes can write and update information in these molecular switches.
  - Talin is proposed as the primary memory molecule in animals.
  - This mechanical layer integrates with chemical and ionic signaling for information processing.
  - >-
    Each mechanical switch can store one bit of data, with action potentials entering new
    information.
  - The MeshCODE framework suggests an addressable read-write memory mechanism for the brain.
