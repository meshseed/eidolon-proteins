title: 'GRAPH_EXPORT_SUITE: Repository Graph Generation and Validation'
summary: >-
  The GRAPH_EXPORT_SUITE v1.0 orchestrates the creation of a graph representation from a
  repository's capsules. It scans for capsules, builds a node registry with metadata, resolves
  relationships into directed edges, and emits CSV files for nodes and edges.  A quality gate
  ensures data integrity before a version snapshot is created.
insights:
  - The suite processes repository capsules to construct a graph model.
  - Node registry includes metadata, Obsidian, and Gephi fields, with a computed node_id.
  - Echo paths are used to define directed edges between nodes.
  - CSV outputs (nodes.csv, edges.csv) and a manifest are generated.
  - A quality gate validates the exported graph data, logging errors to an audit file.
  - Version control is maintained through commit hashes and export timestamps in a manifest.
