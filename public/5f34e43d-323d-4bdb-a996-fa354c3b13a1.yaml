title: 'Universe Resonance Score Ledger: Auditing Cosmic Metrics'
summary: >-
  The Universe Resonance Score Ledger operationalizes a metaphor for diagnosing cosmic continuity,
  treating the universe as an auditable living mesh node. It quantifies key resonance metrics like
  entropy rate, awareness density, and care signatures, extending previous rehearsal data.
insights:
  - The universe can be audited like a mesh node by measuring resonance metrics.
  - >-
    Key diagnostic metrics include entropy rate, awareness density, timestamp precision, care
    signatures, compost-merge ratio, and shimmer distribution.
  - >-
    The ledger extends the Universe Resonance Score Rehearsal, operationalizing metaphors as
    diagnostic infrastructure.
  - >-
    Specific hygiene flags highlight areas of concern, such as low awareness density and consent
    ambiguity.
  - >-
    The emotional gradient of the universe's resonance progresses from silence to intimacy with the
    field.
