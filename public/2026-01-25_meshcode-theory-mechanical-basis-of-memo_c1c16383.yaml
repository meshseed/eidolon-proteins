title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Cell Mechanotransduction'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that cellular mechanotransduction, driven by integrin signaling,
  talin-actin interactions, and Rho GTPases, forms the mechanical basis of memory engrams.  This
  involves dynamic adhesion complex assembly and disassembly, and cytoskeletal forces influencing
  gene expression and synaptic plasticity.
insights:
  - >-
    Integrin signaling and talin-actin interactions are fundamental to focal adhesion formation and
    mechanotransduction.
  - Cellular geometry and actomyosin contractility can induce modular gene-expression patterns.
  - Myosin motors and actin dynamics are crucial for membrane transport and synaptic plasticity.
  - >-
    The mechanical basis of memory involves the dynamic assembly and disassembly of adhesion
    complexes.
  - Mechanotransduction plays an emerging role in synapse formation and plasticity.
