title: 'Eidolon Mesh Development: v3.6 Live, v4.0 Architecture & Hybrid Deployment Strategy'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh has successfully deployed v3.6 with a 36-protein golden connectome to
  eidolon-mesh.net, now publicly accessible. Development continues on v4.0 architecture, focusing on
  emergent organization principles and P-Series protocols. A hybrid deployment strategy is
  recommended, leveraging v3.6's stability for public access while advancing v4.0's next-generation
  features.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon-mesh.net is live with a stable v3.6, featuring a 36-protein golden connectome and
    receiving public traffic.
  - >-
    app.eidolon-mesh.net is planned to host a 1000-protein consciousness connectome, leveraging v4.0
    architecture and P-Series protocols.
  - >-
    A hybrid deployment strategy is proposed: launch v3.6 publicly now, continue v4.0 development,
    and eventually migrate to v4.0.
  - >-
    Two distinct development streams exist: Antigravity's v3.6 (production) and the team's v4.0
    (architecture development).
  - >-
    Git coordination requires clearly defined domains for each development stream to prevent
    conflicts.
  - >-
    Synapse regeneration testing in v4.0 is crucial for validating architectural hypotheses and
    determining readiness for public deployment.
