title: 'Connectome Clusters and Curvature: Mapping Conceptual Tension'
summary: >-
  This analysis defines a method to identify major clusters and high-curvature zones in a
  connectome, where multiple semantic directions intersect. Curvature represents conceptual tension,
  density gradients, or attractor interference, revealing developmental hotspots and integration
  challenges.
insights:
  - Clusters form around stable attractors and dense semantic regions.
  - Curvature arises at the convergence or conflict of multiple semantic domains.
  - High-curvature zones signify conceptual tension or pressure for synthesis.
  - Mapping curvature highlights areas of intense development and integration difficulty.
  - Cluster analysis can diagnose both structural and emotional fidelity.
