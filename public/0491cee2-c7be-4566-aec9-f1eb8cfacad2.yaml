title: 'Graph Theory: Structure, Connectivity, and Network Properties'
summary: >-
  Graph theory models relationships and structures using vertices and edges, analyzing connectivity
  and properties like planarity.  It underpins applications from computer networks to social
  systems, revealing how connections dictate function.
insights:
  - Relationships inherently create structure within systems.
  - Connectivity patterns are key indicators of a system's properties and behavior.
  - Network topology directly influences how information or influence flows.
  - The meaning and function of individual components are defined by their connections to the whole.
