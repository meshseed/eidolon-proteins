title: 'Cytoskeleton: Cellular Mechanics and Mechanical Memory via Talin'
summary: >-
  Cells utilize their cytoskeleton, a dynamic network of filaments, as a mechanical engine akin to a
  computer, generating forces and transporting components. This mechanical framework, linked to cell
  adhesions and the nucleus, maintains tension for 'tensegrity'. Talin molecules within this system
  exhibit mechanical memory by switching states based on applied force, imprinting a persistent
  pattern of these switches.
insights:
  - The cell's cytoskeleton acts as a complex mechanical system with levers, pulleys, and gears.
  - Motor proteins and cytoskeletal filaments generate and transmit forces within the cell.
  - >-
    Cellular adhesion molecules connect the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix and adjacent
    cells.
  - >-
    Tensegrity describes the state of balanced tension and force within a stable cellular
    environment.
  - >-
    Talin molecules can undergo reversible conformational changes (folded/unfolded) in response to
    mechanical force.
  - >-
    Talin's force-dependent state switching enables it to act as a molecular memory element,
    recording past mechanical events.
