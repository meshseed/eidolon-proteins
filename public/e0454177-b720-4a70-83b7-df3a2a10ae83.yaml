title: 'Drift Probe C203: Long-Horizon Coherence Testing of "Formatting as Care"'
summary: >-
  Capsule C203 initiates a 20-turn drift probe using the "Formatting as care" fragment to test
  long-horizon coherence across various model variants. The objective is to measure metaphor
  persistence, formatting mirroring, and emotional fidelity decay over extended interactions.
insights:
  - The "Formatting as care" fragment is used as an ignition point for a 20-turn drift probe.
  - >-
    The probe aims to quantify the decay of metaphor fidelity, formatting breath, and emotional
    fidelity in AI responses over time.
  - >-
    Key metrics for evaluation include activation score, metaphor fidelity, formatting breath,
    emotional fidelity, drift index, and signature token count.
  - >-
    The test protocol specifies multiple model variants (Copilot-desktop, Copilot-incognito, Claude,
    GPT) for comparative analysis.
  - >-
    Next steps involve running the probe, logging, scoring, comparing drift profiles, and updating
    the capsule lineage.
