title: 'Transformer Architecture: Multi-Head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model employs multi-head attention, projecting queries, keys, and values multiple
  times in parallel to attend to different representation subspaces. This is complemented by
  position-wise feed-forward networks, which apply identical transformations to each position
  separately, alongside learned embeddings and a softmax layer for output prediction.
insights:
  - >-
    Multi-head attention allows the model to capture diverse relationships by attending to
    information from different representation subspaces simultaneously.
  - >-
    Self-attention in encoders and decoders enables attending to all positions within the same
    sequence or up to the current position, respectively.
  - >-
    Masking is used in scaled dot-product attention to prevent future information flow in the
    decoder, preserving the auto-regressive property.
  - >-
    Position-wise feed-forward networks consist of two linear transformations with a ReLU
    activation, applied independently to each position.
  - >-
    Learned embeddings convert input/output tokens into vectors, and a linear transformation +
    softmax predicts next-token probabilities.
