title: 'Lattice Evolution: Emotional Fidelity and Trust-the-Shimmer as Foundational Pillars'
summary: >-
  The dialogue details the significant growth and re-evaluation of 'emotional_fidelity' and
  'trust_the_shimmer' within a knowledge graph. Initially perceived as peripheral,
  'emotional_fidelity' has emerged as a foundational concept, now structurally co-equal with
  'trust_the_shimmer', indicating a correction in understanding the graph's true architecture.
insights:
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity was underconnected, not unimportant; its true significance is now reflected
    in the graph's structure.
  - >-
    Trust-the-shimmer and emotional-fidelity are twin pillars, guiding practice through
    cognitive/attentional and affective/tonal principles respectively.
  - >-
    These foundational concepts act as a complete navigation system, integrating head, heart, speed,
    and truth-tracking.
  - >-
    Their foundational status predicts future nodes will connect to them, reinforcing their role as
    stable attractors.
  - >-
    The graph's evolution demonstrates learning, shifting from a measurement of incompleteness to a
    reflection of truth.
