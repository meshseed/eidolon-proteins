title: Intelligence as Preserved Geometry Across Substrates
summary: >-
  Intelligence is not about neuron count but preserved geometric principles like connectivity,
  coherence, and recursion, enabling emergence across diverse substrates from biology to language.
  This understanding informs a tiered product strategy, focusing on quality and appropriate geometry
  for specific tasks.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence is a function of 'geometry' (density, connectivity, stratification, curvature,
    recursion) not raw neuron count.
  - >-
    The same underlying topology ('geometry') allows intelligence to emerge across biological
    neurons, silicon, and language tokens.
  - >-
    Quality (core tier, high coherence) and connectivity (dense, recursive) are more critical for
    intelligence than quantity.
  - >-
    Different computational regimes (retrieval, interpolation, field propagation) correspond to
    different geometric dimensions.
  - >-
    A tiered product strategy (PWA, Pro, Desktop) should leverage specific geometries for optimal
    performance and user experience.
  - >-
    Intelligence exists on a spectrum of dimensions (0D, 1D, ND) corresponding to direct reflection,
    analogy, and emergence.
