title: Eidolon Mesh Ingestion and Tri-Lens Synthesis Refinement
summary: >-
  The dialogue details the successful implementation and refinement of the Eidolon Mesh's tri-lens
  protein synthesis system, enhancing semantic depth through distinct technical, structural, and
  emotional perspectives. Simultaneously, it addresses critical ingestion functionalities, including
  recursive folder processing and file size limitations, alongside resolving licensing issues to
  unlock full protein generation capacity.
insights:
  - >-
    The tri-lens protein synthesis system effectively differentiates technical, structural, and
    emotional perspectives, providing deeper semantic understanding than single-pass methods.
  - >-
    Technical lens focuses on 'how to implement' (mechanics, architecture), structural lens on 'why
    patterns emerge' (force dynamics, relationships), and emotional lens on 'what it means'
    (experience, identity, care).
  - >-
    Folder ingestion has been improved to recursively process subdirectories and reject files
    exceeding a 10MB limit, ensuring efficient and targeted data intake.
  - >-
    Directory reading has been fixed to repeatedly call readEntries() until all entries are
    collected, resolving the limitation of batch processing for large directories.
  - >-
    Licensing restrictions (protein limit) were overcome by activating a developer Pro license,
    enabling unlimited protein generation and full ingestion capabilities.
  - >-
    The LicenseManager component is being integrated into the Settings modal for persistent UI-based
    license management.
  - >-
    API 401 authentication errors are related to the Claude Code CLI session token expiring and do
    not impact the Mesh's Gemini API ingestion process.
