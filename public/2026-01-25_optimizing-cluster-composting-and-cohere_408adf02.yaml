title: Optimizing Cluster Composting and Coherence Normalization in EIDOLON-MESH
summary: >-
  The EIDOLON-MESH system encountered performance issues in cluster-based composting due to an O(n²)
  complexity arising from overly permissive attractor detection thresholds. This was resolved by
  increasing selectivity (minCoherence: 0.92, minDegree: 30) and implementing a safety abort for
  excessive attractors. Additionally, a coherence normalization feature was added to the Settings
  modal, allowing for better distribution of coherence scores across the 0.50-1.00 range, which is
  crucial for effective metabolism thresholds and semantic ranking. Progress logging for
  normalization was also implemented for improved user feedback.
insights:
  - >-
    Cluster composting performance was bottlenecked by an O(n²) complexity in attractor matching,
    caused by overly broad initial detection thresholds.
  - >-
    Increasing attractor detection selectivity (minCoherence: 0.92, minDegree: 30) and adding a
    safety abort limit prevents performance degradation.
  - >-
    Coherence normalization is essential for distributing scores across a meaningful range
    (0.50-1.00), enabling effective metabolism thresholds and semantic differentiation.
  - >-
    A UI for coherence normalization, including analysis and actual normalization with progress
    tracking, was implemented in the Settings modal.
  - >-
    Improved logging and progress callbacks were added to the coherence normalization process to
    provide real-time user feedback.
  - >-
    The effectiveness of coherence normalization was highlighted by a comparison of query results
    before and after normalization, demonstrating improved relevance and differentiation.
