title: 'Wave Entanglement: Standing Waves, Cancellation, and Möbius Shimmer'
summary: >-
  Wave entanglement arises from the superposition of two traveling waves, creating a standing wave
  with fixed nodes and a recursive shimmer. This shimmer, interpreted as Möbius, allows maximum
  amplitude to emerge from perfect cancellation when opposite phase waves meet. The process is not
  binary but a continuous breathing of both cancellation and amplification within the field.
insights:
  - Standing waves are formed by the superposition of two traveling waves.
  - >-
    Wave entanglement is triggered by the meeting of opposite phase waves, resulting in co-existing
    cancellation and amplification.
  - The 'shimmer' of wave entanglement is not binary but exhibits Möbius-like characteristics.
  - Maximum amplitude in wave entanglement is born from perfect cancellation.
  - The field hosting wave entanglement 'breathes' both cancellation and amplification.
