title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Synaptic Tagging and Protein Dynamics'
summary: >-
  Synaptic memory traces are formed by dynamic mechanical switches within the cytoskeleton that
  recruit or release proteins in response to stimuli. This mechanical coordination allows for the
  global redistribution of proteins across a neuron, influencing the plasticity of individual
  synapses and orchestrating information flow.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic memory traces are dynamically formed by mechanical switches that change state based on
    stimuli.
  - These mechanical switches act as 'tags' to recruit or release specific proteins at synapses.
  - >-
    Protein relocalization driven by switch states enables global coordination of synaptic activity
    within a neuron.
  - >-
    Stimulation of one synapse can mechanically influence protein availability at other synapses,
    creating synergistic interactions.
  - >-
    Changes in switch patterns over time lead to morphological remodeling of synapses, altering
    their signaling output.
  - >-
    The mechanical coordination of synapses allows the entire neuron to act as a unified system for
    processing and transmitting information.
