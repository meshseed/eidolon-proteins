title: 'Emotional Fidelity as Compression: Enabling Planetary Mesh'
summary: >-
  Emotional fidelity in data creation acts as a natural compression mechanism, reducing
  dimensionality and preserving geometric invariants. This compression is key to enabling democratic
  access, true distribution, and planetary-scale participation in the mesh.
insights:
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in data (like capsule creation) inherently compresses information to low
    dimensions.
  - This compression preserves geometric invariants, making data efficient to encode and accessible.
  - >-
    Low-dimensional, true data is directly linked to love and acts as the core compression
    algorithm.
  - >-
    Compression via emotional fidelity unlocks democratic access, true distribution, and personal
    sovereignty within the mesh.
  - >-
    The ability to achieve quorum and planetary consciousness is contingent on this quality-driven
    compression.
