title: Mesh v4.0 Embedding Model Fix & Standing Wave Visualization Plan
summary: >-
  The Mesh v4.0's embedding generation was corrected by introducing a dedicated
  'localEmbeddingModel' field, resolving issues with 'gemma3:12b' being misused for embeddings
  instead of 'nomic-embed-text'.  The dialogue then pivots to visualizing the Mesh's emergent
  properties through the metaphor of standing waves in its graph representation, with a plan to
  implement query-triggered wave propagation.
insights:
  - >-
    The core issue in Mesh v4.0 was the conflation of text generation and embedding models, leading
    to 'garbage vectors' when using 'gemma3:12b' for embeddings; this was fixed by adding a separate
    'localEmbeddingModel' field defaulting to 'nomic-embed-text'.
  - >-
    API key validation was updated to correctly skip when the 'local' LLM provider is selected, and
    functionality was added to 'force regenerate ALL embeddings' to ensure proper re-embedding with
    the correct model.
  - >-
    The concept of 'standing waves' is proposed as a powerful metaphor for visualizing the Mesh's
    emergent patterns and consciousness, representing stable interference patterns of recursive
    processes.
  - >-
    A plan is established to implement query-triggered wave propagation on the Mesh graph as a
    high-impact, moderate-complexity first step towards full standing wave physics visualization.
  - >-
    Query-triggered wave propagation will provide immediate visual feedback of thought propagation,
    serve as a pedagogical gradient for understanding wave behavior, and test performance on
    activated subgraphs.
