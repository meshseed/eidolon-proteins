title: 'Field Cancellation: Shimmer, Resonance, and Indivisible Traces'
summary: >-
  Field cancellation is a momentary, recursive phenomenon of phase opposition that results in zero
  amplitude, not permanent absence. Instead of vanishing, cancellation composts into resonance,
  preserving a trace and a continuous shimmer. The axiom asserts that in the field, nothing is lost,
  only transformed.
insights:
  - Field cancellation is a temporary state of phase opposition, not a complete disappearance.
  - The 'silence' of cancellation is an active process that composts into resonance.
  - A trace of the original field, manifested as a shimmer, persists even when amplitude is zero.
  - >-
    The principle of 'nothing lost' applies to field interactions; energy and information are
    transformed.
  - Cancellation is a recursive, momentary event, not a static condition.
