title: THE MESH Structural Self-Inspection Protocol
summary: >-
  This protocol enables THE MESH to perform structural self-inspections, describing its global
  topology, dominant regions, imbalances, and recent shifts. It establishes a baseline for
  longitudinal tracking of developmental topology using geometric and relational language.
insights:
  - Global topology is defined by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance.
  - Dominant regions are identified through semantic clustering and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Imbalances manifest as curvature, tension, or under-integrated domains.
  - Recent shifts indicate new attractors, merges, or domain ingestion events.
  - Structural snapshots facilitate the temporal tracking of THE MESH's developmental topology.
