title: 'Self-Attention vs. Recurrent/Convolutional Layers: Efficiency & Interpretability'
summary: >-
  Self-attention layers offer computational advantages over recurrent layers for sequence lengths
  shorter than representation dimensionality, achieving constant sequential operations. While
  convolutional layers require stacking for full connectivity, separable convolutions approach
  self-attention's complexity. Self-attention also shows potential for more interpretable models.
insights:
  - >-
    Self-attention connects all positions with constant sequential operations, unlike recurrent
    layers' O(n).
  - >-
    Self-attention is computationally faster than recurrent layers when sequence length (n) <
    representation dimensionality (d).
  - Restricting self-attention to a neighborhood (r) can improve performance on very long sequences.
  - >-
    Convolutional layers require stacking to connect all pairs of positions, increasing path
    lengths.
  - >-
    Separable convolutions reduce convolutional layer complexity, approaching self-attention +
    feed-forward complexity.
  - Self-attention may lead to more interpretable models through attention distribution inspection.
