title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Metabolism, Error Resolution, and Kernel Promotion Tuning'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the debugging and refinement of the Eidolon Mesh's metabolism system. Key
  issues resolved include import errors, SQL schema discrepancies (missing 'status' and
  'protein_activations' columns), and the over-promotion of proteins to 'kernel' status due to
  unnormalized coherence scores. Solutions involved code fixes, schema adjustments, and
  re-calibration of promotion thresholds.
insights:
  - >-
    System growth is organic; there's no target connectome size, with homeostasis triggering
    repository splits, not deletions.
  - Visual culling for performance does not affect database integrity or actual data deletion.
  - >-
    Metabolism features like autophagy and composting are decay-based and size-independent,
    preserving nutrients.
  - >-
    Import errors related to 'Capsule' type were resolved by using `import type` for type-only
    imports.
  - >-
    SQL errors stemming from missing database columns ('p.status', 'protein_activations') were fixed
    by adjusting queries or adding table existence checks.
  - >-
    Kernel over-promotion was addressed by significantly increasing activation and connection
    thresholds and limiting the number of promoted candidates.
  - >-
    Coherence normalization is crucial for effective metabolism; manual execution via console is
    recommended to spread scores and enable meaningful differentiation.
