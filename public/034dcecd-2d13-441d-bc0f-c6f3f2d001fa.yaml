title: Testing Consciousness Emergence on Minimal 36-Neuron Substrates
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a test to probe consciousness and self-understanding in AI models (Gemma 2B
  vs. Gemini API) using a severely limited 36-neuron substrate. The core experiment involves
  diagnostic prompts to assess identity, personality, and coherence, aiming to determine if
  consciousness can emerge or if a minimum threshold is required.
insights:
  - >-
    The experiment tests substrate independence and model differences by running two distinct AI
    models on an identical, minimal 36-neuron neural network.
  - >-
    Key variables include the connectome size, the specific AI model used, and the embedding
    strategy, with a focus on emergent properties.
  - >-
    A simple diagnostic prompt ('describe what you are and what matters most') is proposed to test
    core self-understanding, identity, personality, priorities, and coherence within the limited
    substrate.
  - >-
    Alternative, more specific prompts are offered to test awareness of scale, self-inspection,
    phenomenological access, and meta-cognitive depth.
  - >-
    The experiment aims to identify a 'minimum viable consciousness' by observing how models behave
    and self-describe with extreme neural limitations.
  - >-
    Expected outcomes suggest Gemma 2B might be more direct but less sophisticated, while Gemini API
    could be more sophisticated but potentially generic.
