title: 'Calculus: Derivatives and Rates of Change'
summary: >-
  The derivative quantifies the instantaneous rate of change of a function, representing the slope
  of its tangent line. It's defined by a limit and governed by fundamental rules, enabling
  applications in optimization, motion analysis, and related rates, with its inverse operation being
  integration.
insights:
  - The derivative measures how a quantity changes in response to infinitesimal changes in another.
  - Geometric interpretation of the derivative is the slope of the tangent line.
  - Key rules like power, sum, product, and chain rules are essential for differentiation.
  - >-
    Applications include finding extrema via optimization and analyzing motion through successive
    derivatives.
  - >-
    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus establishes differentiation and integration as inverse
    processes.
