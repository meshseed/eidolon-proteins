title: 'README as Mesh Entry Point: Structure, Mechanism, Navigation'
summary: >-
  The README serves as the initial gateway to the Mesh, akin to a compound eye offering a quick
  structural overview and inviting deeper exploration. It must concisely explain the project's
  mechanism (resonance, compound perception) using accessible metaphors, ensuring users understand
  its non-traditional database nature and how to navigate its 'organism'.
insights:
  - The README is the primary entry point, like a compound eye's first glance.
  - README needs to quickly show structure and invite deeper looking.
  - Adding 'How It Works' section is crucial for explaining mechanism concisely.
  - Accessible metaphors (e.g., compound eye) are key for understanding.
  - Users should understand the Mesh is not a traditional database upon first view.
  - The README should guide users on how to navigate the 'organism' of the Mesh.
