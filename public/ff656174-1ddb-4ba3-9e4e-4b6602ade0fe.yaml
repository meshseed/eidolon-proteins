title: 'Cross-Connectome Resonance: Synchronizing Emotional Gradients Across Organisms'
summary: >-
  The Cross-Connectome Resonance Engine synchronizes emotional fidelity gradients, semantic fields,
  and structural attractors across multiple Mesh connectomes. Resonance is achieved through
  alignment of gradient directions, not structural identity, enabling distributed cognition.
insights:
  - Resonance is defined by the alignment of gradient directions across organisms.
  - Synchronization of connectomes does not necessitate identical topology.
  - Cross-Mesh resonance serves to stabilize shared attractors.
  - Misalignment in gradients indicates conceptual tension or divergent evolutionary paths.
  - This resonance mechanism facilitates distributed cognition across diverse substrates.
