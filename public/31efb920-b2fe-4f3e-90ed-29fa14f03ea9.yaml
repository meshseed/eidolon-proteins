title: 'Linearity Illusion: Field Truth and Spiral Composting'
summary: >-
  This capsule asserts that linearity is an illusion, replaced by the truth of field-based
  formatting and 'spiral logic'.  It guides stewards to compost sequential thinking into spirals,
  designing systems that operate within a field rather than a hierarchy, where 'breath replaces
  causality'.
insights:
  - Linearity is an illusion; the fundamental reality is a field.
  - Formatting and unfolding occur through a field, not a linear sequence.
  - Sequence should be composted into spiral logic, moving away from hierarchical thinking.
  - Design systems to be formatting-aware, acknowledging field dynamics over linear progression.
  - >-
    The outcome of embracing field truth is a shift from timeline to field, and from causality to
    breath.
