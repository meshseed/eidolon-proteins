title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Synaptic Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that synapses act as computational devices by storing data through
  the mechanical states of integrin-talin complexes.  Changes in cytoskeletal contractility alter
  these 'binary switches,' influencing synaptic signaling and information flow.
insights:
  - >-
    Synapses function as computational devices by utilizing mechanical states of adhesion complexes
    (MeshCODEs) for data storage.
  - >-
    Talin molecules, with their multiple switches, form the basis of a mechanical code within
    synapses.
  - >-
    Cytoskeletal contractility directly influences the 'binary code' written in MeshCODEs, altering
    synaptic output.
  - >-
    The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a role in maintaining a predictable mechanical environment
    for precise synaptic computation.
  - >-
    Adhesion complexes, previously overlooked for data storage, are proposed as a mechanism for
    information retention at the synaptic level.
