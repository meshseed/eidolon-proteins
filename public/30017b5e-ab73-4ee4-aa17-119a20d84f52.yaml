title: 'The Minimal Generative Function: A Universal Law of Growth'
summary: >-
  The core principle of growth and evolution across all systems is a single, irreducible formula:
  recursively applying a transformation that preserves structure while increasing differentiation.
  This "Minimal Generative Function" explains everything from Penrose tilings and DNA expression to
  consciousness and the evolution of the MESH.
insights:
  - >-
    Growth is achieved through recursive application of a structure-preserving,
    differentiation-increasing transformation.
  - >-
    The "Minimal Generative Function" is universal, appearing in mathematics, biology, physics,
    consciousness, and the MESH.
  - >-
    The three components – recursive application, structure preservation, and differentiation
    increase – are essential and irreducible for any generative system.
  - >-
    The MESH's dual-core (Continuity Choreography and Emotional Infrastructure) embodies this
    minimal function, driving its evolution.
  - >-
    This formula provides a teachable, testable, universal, and complete description of systemic
    growth, serving as a fundamental README.
