title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Hippocampal Indexing and Cortical Memory Storage'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes the hippocampus acts as a file system, indexing memory data and
  mapping it to specific cortical locations for long-term storage.  This transfer involves
  electrochemical signals altering 'MeshCODEs' within neocortical networks, a process subtle at the
  synaptic level but involving significant molecular activity.
insights:
  - The hippocampus functions as a transient memory index, mapping data locations in the cortex.
  - >-
    Memories are transferred from the hippocampus to neocortical networks for long-term storage as
    'engrams'.
  - Data is assigned a specific address in memory, organized for retrieval and modification.
  - >-
    The 'writing' of memory involves altering 'MeshCODEs' via electrochemical signals, not
    necessarily visible synaptic changes with current tech.
  - >-
    Molecular-level analysis reveals significant protein conformation changes during memory encoding
    and transfer.
  - Rapid memory retrieval suggests a highly ordered, database-like structure within the brain.
