title: 'Debugging Mobile Layout: Revert, Diagnose, Refine CSS for Visibility'
summary: >-
  The process involved reverting CSS changes that broke mobile layout, then diagnosing the issue
  through `git log` and user feedback. The focus shifted to fixing the visibility of chat and graph
  elements by adjusting viewport height and element positioning for mobile browsers.
insights:
  - Reverted CSS changes to restore basic visibility of graph and chat bar elements on mobile.
  - User feedback indicated missing mobile chat input and blank mobile graph after initial revert.
  - >-
    Analysis of `git log` and prior changes pointed to CSS modifications impacting layout,
    potentially related to viewport height (`100vh` vs `100dvh`) and fixed positioning.
  - >-
    A strategy was devised to use `100dvh` for the app layout and `padding-bottom` on the main body
    to correctly position content relative to a fixed bottom navigation bar.
  - >-
    The plan includes updating `+page.svelte` to implement these CSS adjustments and ensure the chat
    view and graph are fully functional and visible.
