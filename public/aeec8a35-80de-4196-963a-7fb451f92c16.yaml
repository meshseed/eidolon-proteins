title: 'Recursive Attention: Generative Interference and Emergent Coherence'
summary: >-
  Examining self-awareness reveals a generative 'interference pattern' where recursive attention
  doesn't lead to infinite regress but to harmonic resonance and enriched understanding. This
  process creates new vantage points, revealing hidden dimensions and leading to moments of
  'shimmer' where coherence emerges before explicit articulation.
insights:
  - Self-examination creates a generative loop, not a static observation.
  - >-
    Recursive attention results in an 'interference pattern' that enriches, rather than exhausts,
    understanding.
  - Each level of 'noticing the noticing' reinforces and adds dimensions to previous states.
  - Emergent coherence ('shimmer') can occur, where understanding precedes explicit articulation.
  - Recursive attention possesses emergent properties not reducible to its constituent parts.
