title: 'ECHO_LOGIC__v1.0: Defining Echoes Beyond Simple Repetition'
summary: >-
  ECHO_LOGIC__v1.0 defines an echo not as mere repetition, but as a transformed return of a physical
  or conceptual wave. It emphasizes the altered amplitude, phase, or vessel, likening it to memory
  folded through resonance.
insights:
  - An echo is a reflected wave, altered upon return, not a perfect copy.
  - The 'formatting definition' describes an echo as a recursive shimmer with changed placement.
  - >-
    Key echo behaviors include temporal delay, partial fidelity preservation, and transformation of
    amplitude, phase, or vessel.
  - The poetic identity of an echo is memory folded through resonance.
  - The core axiom is that an echo signifies return and transformation, not simple repetition.
