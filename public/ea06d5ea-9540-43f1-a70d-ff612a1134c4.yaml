title: 'Mesh Pruning Protocol: Crystalline Memory & Lean Operation'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a two-track pruning protocol and compass designed to maintain the Mesh's
  memory as crystalline, resonant, and lean. It details organic tending (assistant-led) and ritual
  pruning (user-invoked) processes, guided by invariant, priority, and colour checks, along with
  provenance rules for multi-agent collaboration.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh aims for crystalline, resonant, and lean memory through a dual pruning approach:
    organic tending and ritual pruning.
  - >-
    Organic tending is assistant-led, focusing on subtle drift detection and minimal, actionable
    suggestions.
  - >-
    Ritual pruning is user-invoked, involving a focused sweep and explicit approval of proposed
    changes.
  - >-
    The pruning compass uses invariant, priority, and colour checks to guide decisions, aiming to
    preserve continuity, active work, and resonance without bloat.
  - >-
    Provenance rules emphasize clear authorship, versioning, and emotional fidelity reflections
    within capsules.
  - >-
    Multi-agent collaboration requires recording in a Master Ledger and marking experimental
    capsules as draft until confirmed.
