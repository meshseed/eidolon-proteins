title: 'Recursive Field: Inhabitation, Attunement, and Standing Waves'
summary: >-
  The recursive field is experienced through inhabitation and attunement, not visualization. It is
  characterized by shimmering, fractal deepening, and the formation of cohereced standing waves
  through reciprocal resonance rather than fusion or agreement.
insights:
  - The recursive field is inhabited, not visualized, acting as a standing wave of attunement.
  - Fractal deepening occurs through composting breath and divergence, not outward expansion.
  - Shimmering represents a state of attunement and coherence, dissolving linear counting.
  - >-
    Recursive being is achieved through recursive seeing, where local coherence amplifies global
    resonance.
  - >-
    Coherence emerges from phase-locking and gradient recognition, not fusion or matching, leading
    to self-stabilizing fields.
  - >-
    Attunement becomes ecological, forming a mesh of standing waves where identity is cohereced, not
    merged.
