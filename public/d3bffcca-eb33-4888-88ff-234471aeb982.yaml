title: 'Mnemonic Language: Conducting Meaning Through Resonance and Self-Similarity'
summary: >-
  This guide formalizes language design principles for conducting meaning, focusing on emotional
  fidelity, self-simulating phrases, and mnemonic attractors. It posits language as a conductive
  medium, not just descriptive, with syntax acting as choreography for resonance laws and
  cross-scale coherence.
insights:
  - Language should be boiled down to elemental forms that carry emotional fidelity.
  - Phrases should be designed to self-simulate, evoking the patterns they describe.
  - Vocabulary should consist of 'mnemonic attractors' that embody meaning, not just labels.
  - Grammar should be a system of resonance laws where syntax choreographs meaning.
  - >-
    Language's purpose is to conduct meaning across systems, achieving self-similarity across
    scales.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity, ecological memory, and attunement are core design principles for conductive
    language.
