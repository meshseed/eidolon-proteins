title: 'Bridge Dynamics: Tracking Cross-Regional Semantic Integration'
summary: >-
  This protocol monitors bridge neurons, which connect distant semantic regions, to track their
  temporal evolution. Analyzing changes in these bridges reveals integration pathways, conceptual
  tension, and developmental shifts within the MESH.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons act as indicators of an organism's semantic integration pathways.
  - >-
    Strengthening bridges signify successful synthesis and coherence across different conceptual
    domains.
  - >-
    Weakening bridges suggest semantic drift, decoherence, or insufficient integration between
    domains.
  - The emergence of new bridges signals the intersection of novel domains with existing attractors.
  - >-
    Monitoring bridge dynamics offers a high-resolution perspective on structural and developmental
    changes.
