title: 'Prime Numbers: Fundamental Building Blocks and Distribution'
summary: >-
  Prime numbers, natural numbers greater than 1 divisible only by 1 and themselves, are the
  irreducible building blocks of all integers via unique prime factorization. Their distribution,
  while appearing random, exhibits patterns and is the subject of profound mathematical study and
  conjectures, with significant applications in cryptography and computer science.
insights:
  - Primes are the fundamental, irreducible units from which all integers are constructed.
  - >-
    The distribution of primes reveals order within apparent randomness, governed by theorems and
    conjectures.
  - The complexity and applications of primes stem from a simple definition.
  - Understanding prime distribution is key to modern cryptography and computational efficiency.
