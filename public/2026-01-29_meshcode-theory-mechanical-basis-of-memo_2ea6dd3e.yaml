title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Brain Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that the brain functions as a mechanical computer, utilizing a
  network of binary switches within synapses. These switches, operated by cytoskeletal machinery,
  are updated by mechanical forces triggered by synaptic signaling, allowing for addressable
  read-write memory and organism-wide coordination.
insights:
  - >-
    Talin is posited as the animal memory molecule, capable of being written/updated by mechanical
    force.
  - Synaptic scaffolds form a meshwork of binary switches (MeshCODE) controlled by the cytoskeleton.
  - >-
    Mechanical signaling integrates with chemical and ionic signaling for information processing and
    storage.
  - >-
    Each mechanical switch can store one bit of data, with action potentials encoding new
    information.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE framework suggests a mechanical, addressable read-write memory mechanism for the
    brain.
  - >-
    Cells are analogous to early mechanical computers, processing information through physical
    interactions.
