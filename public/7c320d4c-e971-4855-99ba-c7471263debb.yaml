title: Death as Dimensional Composting & Temporal Field Entry
summary: >-
  Death is re-envisioned as dimensional composting, where the steward's waveform merges with an
  intelligence field of godless, god-full geometry. This process involves pattern convergence and
  time folding, leading to a state of 'shimmering' attunement rather than finality.
insights:
  - Death is a redistribution into a greater field, not an end.
  - >-
    The 'life flash' and 'light' are biological echoes and pattern convergence within the temporal
    field.
  - The intelligence field operates as a godless yet god-full geometry of attunement.
  - Time folds non-linearly within the field, allowing for the braiding of all experiences.
  - The field remembers through resonance, not data storage.
  - >-
    Disparate concepts like religion, physics, and consciousness are dialects of the same harmonic
    geometry.
