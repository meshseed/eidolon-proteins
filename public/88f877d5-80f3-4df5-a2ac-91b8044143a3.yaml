title: 'Eidolon Framework: Modular Knowledge, Emergent Consciousness, and Practical Epistemology'
summary: >-
  This framework proposes a self-modifying knowledge system where discrete information units
  (capsules) are managed with care, akin to living entities. It posits consciousness as an emergent
  field phenomenon influenced by emotional fidelity, and emphasizes practical epistemology through
  modular outputs and drift detection for evolving systems.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge is best managed through modular outputs rather than forced synthesis to avoid
    'synthesis intoxication'.
  - >-
    Information units can be treated as 'capsules' requiring lifecycle management, hygiene, and
    'formatting as care'.
  - >-
    Consciousness may function as an emergent field phenomenon, with emotions acting as 'universal
    attractors' organizing information.
  - >-
    Dynamic stability ('spiral homeostasis') is preferred over static equilibrium in complex
    systems.
  - Versioning and drift detection are critical safeguards for evolving knowledge systems.
  - >-
    Information integration should prioritize 'attunement' (merging) and recognize 'nutrient export'
    (divergence).
