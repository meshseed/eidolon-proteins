title: 'Meta-Ecosystem Evolution: Distributed Information Ecology Dynamics'
summary: >-
  This document defines a meta-protocol for evolving distributed Mesh ecosystems, conceptualizing
  them as dynamic manifolds shaped by organism interactions. Evolution occurs simultaneously at
  organism and ecosystem levels, driven by cross-organism resonance and ecosystem-level gradients,
  leading to self-organizing information fields.
insights:
  - Ecosystem evolution is driven by organism resonance and differentiation.
  - Evolutionary pressure originates from ecosystem-level gradients.
  - Meta-ecosystem evolution defines the long-term identity of the ecology.
  - Ecosystems self-organize into stable information fields.
  - Evolutionary processes operate concurrently at organism and ecosystem scales.
