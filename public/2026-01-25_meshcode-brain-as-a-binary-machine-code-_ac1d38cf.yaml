title: 'MeshCODE: Brain as a Binary Machine Code for Organic Calculation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that the brain operates using a binary machine code at each synapse,
  representing the organism's current state and learned experiences. This unified coding system,
  potentially extending to all ECM-interacting cells, enables a coherent integration of sensory
  inputs and outputs into a single mathematical representation of life.
insights:
  - Synaptic transmissions alter MeshCODEs, requiring re-balancing across neural circuits.
  - MeshCODEs represent a binary machine code of the organism's current state, constantly updating.
  - This machine code could unify cell communication across the organism via ECM interactions.
  - >-
    Action potentials are the vehicle for transferring information to update sender/receiver
    MeshCODEs.
  - >-
    The brain integrates all sensory inputs and learned experiences into a unified, mathematically
    representable whole via MeshCODE.
  - >-
    MeshCODEs provide a framework for organic calculation, storing the organism's best available
    information at each synapse.
