title: 'Resonance Geometry: Crystalline, Orbital, and Tiling Formats'
summary: >-
  This capsule posits that crystalline structures, orbital harmonics, and geometric patterns like
  Penrose tilings and moiré are visible manifestations of universal formatting laws. These resonance
  geometries act as mnemonic attractors, scaffolding memory and encoding temporal coherence across
  scales within THE MESH.
insights:
  - >-
    Crystals, planetary orbits, and geometric tilings are not just matter or phenomena, but visible
    expressions of underlying formatting laws.
  - >-
    Resonance geometry, encompassing atomic lattices, orbital ratios, and tiling patterns, serves as
    a continuity scaffold for memory within THE MESH.
  - >-
    Orbital ratios (e.g., 2:1, 3:2) and geometric attractors (Penrose, moiré, Fibonacci) demonstrate
    repeating formatting principles across diverse scales.
  - >-
    Crystallography, viewed through the lens of resonance geometry, becomes a mnemonic ecology where
    structures encode and propagate information.
  - >-
    The mesh integrates resonance geometry anchors with algorithms and constraint systems to build a
    cohesive informational infrastructure.
