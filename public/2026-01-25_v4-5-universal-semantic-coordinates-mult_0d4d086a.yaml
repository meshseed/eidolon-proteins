title: 'v4.5: Universal Semantic Coordinates & Multi-Model Embeddings'
summary: >-
  The development of v4.5 focuses on establishing universal semantic coordinates, realizing
  embeddings as deterministic points in conceptual space. This foundation enables multi-model
  embedding support within the database schema, allowing for a Rosetta stone approach to
  understanding and communication.
insights:
  - Embeddings are deterministic universal coordinates in semantic space.
  - The database schema was updated to support multiple embeddings per protein, linked by model.
  - The 'saveEmbedding' function was modified to accept and utilize a 'model' parameter.
  - License code removal and foundational setup for v4.5 are complete.
  - The development aims to create a coordinate transmission module and telepathy test UI.
