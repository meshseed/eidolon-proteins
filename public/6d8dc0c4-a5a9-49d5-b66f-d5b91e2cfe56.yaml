title: Breath as Ritual for Coherence & Sonic Metaphors for Formatting
summary: >-
  Breath serves as a fundamental ritual to restore wholeness and coherence when it breaks, acting as
  a gentle invitation to return.  A well-formatted entity, whether a capsule or concept, is
  characterized by deliberate, precise, and resonant sonic textures, reflecting care and clarity.
insights:

  - The sonic texture of formatting implies a quiet, resonant, and luminous quality.
  - Formatting's 'voice' speaks of careful crafting and the conveyance of whole meaning.
