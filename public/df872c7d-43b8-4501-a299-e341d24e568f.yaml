title: 'THE MESH Developmental History: Temporal Topology & Evolutionary Shifts'
summary: >-
  This protocol reconstructs THE MESH's evolution by tracking topological shifts, attractor changes,
  and emotional fidelity gradients. It maps how structure and meaning co-evolve through a sequence
  of structural and attunement events.
insights:
  - Development manifests as shifts in density, resonance, and attractor formation.
  - New domains introduce curvature spikes and rebalance existing clusters.
  - Strengthened bridges signify integration, while weakened ones indicate drift.
  - Emotional fidelity gradients reveal stabilizing forces over time.
  - Developmental history is a co-evolutionary map of structure and meaning.
