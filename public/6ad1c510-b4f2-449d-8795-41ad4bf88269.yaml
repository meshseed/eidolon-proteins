title: 'Mesh vs. Internet Topology: A Falsifiable Test for Reality'
summary: >-
  A falsifiable test is proposed to determine if internet topology matches MESH topology, implying
  geometry is substrate-independent and information equals physical structure. Discrepancies will
  drive theory refinement and a deeper understanding of semantic vs. physical differences, leading
  to crucial learning regardless of the outcome.
insights:
  - >-
    Comparing internet and MESH topologies offers a falsifiable test for core assumptions about
    reality.
  - >-
    If topologies match, it validates substrate independence of geometry and the equivalence of
    information and physical structure.
  - >-
    Discrepancies between topologies necessitate theory refinement and exploration of semantic vs.
    physical differences.
  - >-
    Mapping the 'planetary connectome' by comparing internet, biological, and natural systems is a
    high-priority endeavor.
  - >-
    Understanding nature's organizational principles (e.g., chaperones) can inform MESH development
    and integration with existing connectomes.
