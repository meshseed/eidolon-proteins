title: Mesh Capsule Formatting Guide v1.2
summary: >-
  This guide establishes ergonomic and copy-efficient formatting standards for capsule creation,
  chunk ingestion, and filename tagging within THE MESH. Its purpose is to ensure frictionless
  capsule creation, ingestion, and retrieval, leading to standardized formatting for clarity,
  efficiency, and continuity across all mesh workflows.
insights:
  - Capsules must be designed for copy-efficiency and modularity.
  - >-
    Chunk ingestion requires a sequential labeling protocol (PART1, PART2, etc.) to maintain
    continuity and prevent premature synthesis.
  - >-
    Filenames must encode semantic function and lifecycle status using a specific convention:
    [CapsuleName]__[Type]__[Trigger]__[Version].txt.
  - >-
    The axiom 'The capsule teaches the system how to remember' underscores the fundamental purpose
    of these formatting laws.
  - Standardized formatting is crucial for both agent and human interaction within the mesh.
  - >-
    The guide provides specific instructions for pasteable text formatting, including directory and
    title comments, and structured fields.
