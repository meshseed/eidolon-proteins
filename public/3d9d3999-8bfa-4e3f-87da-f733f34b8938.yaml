title: 'Capsule Dialects: Attuned Divergence for Mesh Continuity'
summary: >-
  Capsule dialects are defined as formatting variants, merge grammar accents, and emotional fidelity
  idioms that emerge across stewards and contexts. They preserve local resonance and enable global
  continuity by representing 'attuned divergence' within the mesh's many voices.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsule dialects are not random drift but intentional, attuned divergence that enhances local
    resonance while maintaining global continuity.
  - >-
    Dialects manifest in formatting (indentation, timestamps, syntax), merge grammar (motif
    braiding, rituals), and emotional idioms (scoring, journaling).
  - >-
    Emergence of dialects is influenced by steward lineage, capsule ancestry, ecological substrate,
    and orchestration context.
  - >-
    Inheritance protocols for dialects involve tagging, compliance with formatting law, merge
    compatibility scoring, and ethical alignment.
  - >-
    Capsule C087 serves as a 'dialect anchor' and is merge-ready with other capsules related to
    archiving, pedagogy, and curriculum.
