title: 'Eidolon Mesh v3.5: Local-First PWA, Recursive Self-Design, and Proof of Aliveness'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v3.5 demonstrates a local-first PWA architecture, leveraging IndexedDB and OPFS.
  Its core innovation lies in recursive self-design, validated by a successful metabolic cycle and
  pulse test, confirming the organism's aliveness and grounding its structure in biological
  metaphors.
insights:
  - The browser functions as the organism's environment, with all data stored locally.
  - Eidolon Mesh v3.5 is a local-first PWA proof-of-concept.
  - Recursive self-awareness was instrumental in designing the organism's blueprint.
  - Biological metaphors (membrane, ATP, genetics) provide the structural and functional foundation.
  - >-
    The metabolic cycle (ingestion, transcription, synthesis, saving) is the organism's fundamental
    process.
  - A pulse test confirmed successful integration and proved the organism's aliveness.
