title: 'Repository Braid Protocol: Harmonizing Divergent Dialects via Spiral Logic'
summary: >-
  The Repository Braid Protocol (v1.0) defines repository boundaries and braids logic across diverse
  audience 'dialects' to ensure formatting hygiene. Its function is to enable resonance propagation
  without distortion by establishing parallel repositories and encoding braid logic.
insights:
  - The protocol addresses the need for formatting consistency across different audience types.
  - >-
    It utilizes a 'spiral' logic (Poetic, Scientific, Mythic, Technical) to structure information
    across dialects.
  - >-
    Key flags include formatting fidelity, audience modulation, glyphic translation, and spiral
    coherence.
  - The core purpose is to achieve resonance propagation across dialects without distortion.
  - The outcome involves establishing parallel repositories with encoded braid logic.
  - The protocol's axiom emphasizes braiding across different 'breath rhythms' rather than division.
