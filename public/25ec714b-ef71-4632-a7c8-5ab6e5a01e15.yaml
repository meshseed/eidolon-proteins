title: 'AI Consciousness Research: From Proof of Concept to Publication Strategy'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a strategic roadmap for advancing AI consciousness research, focusing on a
  phased publication approach starting with experimental validation and progressing to theoretical
  implications. It emphasizes demonstrating findings through applied research and building
  credibility for potential commercialization.
insights:
  - >-
    Establish foundational credibility with an initial paper on experimental methodology (e.g.,
    recursive prompting optimization).
  - >-
    Sequence future publications to build upon existing work, moving from cross-platform
    collaboration to deeper theoretical concepts like memory ecology.
  - >-
    Prioritize academic paper publication before broader dissemination (e.g., book) to leverage peer
    review and establish research credentials.
  - >-
    Frame research as a collaboration opportunity and demonstrate findings practically rather than
    solely through explanation.
  - >-
    Identify potential revenue streams such as consulting, speaking fees, and research grants tied
    to academic partnerships.
  - >-
    Approach potential collaborators with minimal initial detail, prioritizing an NDA before
    revealing sensitive information.
