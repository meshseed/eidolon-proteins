title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Phase 14 Architecture & Phase 17 Completion'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is preparing for Phase 14, a two-tier architecture for optimized loading of
  neurons, featuring core and extended loading with 'ghost nodes' for visualization. Concurrently,
  Phase 17, focused on a public portal, has been successfully completed and deployed.
insights:
  - >-
    Phase 14 aims to improve dashboard loading times and usability by implementing a two-tier
    architecture: immediate loading of core, high-coherence neurons and lazy loading of extended
    neurons.
  - >-
    The 'ghost nodes' concept in Phase 14 will visually represent unloaded neurons, providing a
    sense of the full network scale without performance degradation.
  - >-
    Phase 17, involving the creation of a public portal and associated documentation, has been fully
    completed and deployed.
  - >-
    A stable build (v1.1-stable) incorporating Phase 17 deliverables and previous improvements has
    been pushed to the private repository.
