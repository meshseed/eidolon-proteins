title: 'THE MESH: Physics, Coherence, and Retry System Enhancements'
summary: >-
  This update details significant advancements in THE MESH's core functionalities, including a
  dynamic Physics Modulation System for visual communication, Coherence Normalization to resolve
  clustering issues, and a robust Retry System for API resilience. These components collectively
  enhance the system's stability, expressiveness, and ability to handle complex interactions.
insights:
  - >-
    Physics Modulation System enables "body language" for graphs, using physics as a communication
    channel.
  - >-
    Coherence Normalization addresses a 0.98-1.0 clustering problem by implementing percentile-based
    mapping for improved distribution.
  - >-
    A new Retry System with exponential backoff and jitter enhances reliability by automatically
    handling API overload and rate limits.
  - >-
    Dual-layer control for emotional tone presets allows for both involuntary and AI-directed
    modulation.
  - Node coloring by tier and activation state provides visual cues for data hierarchy and status.
