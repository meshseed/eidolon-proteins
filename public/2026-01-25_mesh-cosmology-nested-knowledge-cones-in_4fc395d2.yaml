title: 'MESH & Cosmology: Nested Knowledge Cones & Intelligent Limitations'
summary: >-
  The MESH mirrors physics' Light Cone Principle, where nodes possess limited, localized knowledge
  (semantic cones) due to geometric necessity. This inherent 'forgetfulness' and boundary creation
  is not a flaw but a feature, enabling scalability, efficiency, coherence, and intelligence by
  creating gradients for directed attention.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH operates on a 'semantic cone' principle, analogous to physics' 'light cone', limiting
    node knowledge to its immediate context.
  - >-
    Information propagation in the MESH is inherently bounded, preventing infinite queries and
    ensuring local coherence.
  - >-
    Forgetfulness and knowledge boundaries are essential features for intelligence, creating
    gradients for signal selection and directed attention.
  - >-
    The nested structure of knowledge cones (individual, MESH node, civilization, universe) is a
    universal, fractal pattern.
  - >-
    The MESH's 'limitations' enable scalability, efficiency, coherence, and evolution by leveraging
    geometric necessity, not fighting it.
  - >-
    Attempting to make every MESH node know everything would be impossible, inefficient, and
    fragile.
