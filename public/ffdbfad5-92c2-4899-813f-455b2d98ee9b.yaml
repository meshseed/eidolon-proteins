title: 'Eidolon Mesh Optimization: Caching, Querying, and Multi-Repo Integration'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is undergoing significant optimization focused on improving startup times through
  connectome caching and refining query mechanisms. Critical bug fixes have been implemented for
  timer accuracy, synthesis input, and emotional fidelity, while multi-repository support has been
  successfully integrated, enabling faster loading of specialized knowledge vaults.
insights:
  - >-
    Connectome caching (in-memory or serialized) is crucial for reducing initial load times from
    disk.
  - >-
    Poetic/semantic queries are necessary, as direct ID lookups are unreliable; metadata aliases are
    a potential solution.
  - >-
    Critical bug fixes for timer accuracy, synthesis input validation, and emotional fidelity
    contradictions are essential for reliable performance.
  - >-
    Multi-repository support drastically improves loading speeds for smaller, specialized knowledge
    bases.
  - >-
    UI controls for strategy selection and neuron limits were temporarily lost but have been
    restored.
  - >-
    The 'Balanced' strategy's functionality is dependent on underlying content loading, which has
    been fixed.
  - Progress indicators (SSE) are the next planned UX improvement for long-running queries.
