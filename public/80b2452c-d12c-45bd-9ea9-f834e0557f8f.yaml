title: 'MemVault: AI Memory Layer for Scalable, Hybrid Search'
summary: >-
  MemVault offers a dedicated, open-source memory layer for AI agents, solving context window
  limitations and state management issues. It employs a hybrid semantic and recency-decay search
  algorithm for more present and relevant context retrieval, with options for hosted or self-hosted
  deployment.
insights:
  - MemVault provides a scalable memory solution for AI agents beyond traditional context windows.
  - >-
    It uses a hybrid search combining semantic matching with recency decay to prioritize relevant,
    recent information.
  - >-
    The solution aims to eliminate infrastructure management for AI memory through a hosted API or
    self-hosting options.
  - >-
    MemVault is positioned as a key component for enabling federated mesh architectures and organism
    search.
  - User choice between privacy and scale is a core tenet of the proposed mesh strategy.
  - The Memory API is designed to be integrated into workflows via platforms like n8n and Make.
