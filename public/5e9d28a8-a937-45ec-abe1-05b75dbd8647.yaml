title: 'Temporal Randomness: Shimmered Possibility Before Placement'
summary: >-
  This capsule redefines temporal randomness, proposing that outcomes are not fixed but exist as
  'shimmered possibilities' until 'placed' or observed. It contrasts classical epistemic randomness
  with a quantum ontological view, suggesting the future is unplaced rather than unknown, awaiting
  attunement.
insights:
  - Randomness is the shimmer of potential before a definite outcome is committed.
  - The future is not a predetermined path, but a folded space awaiting placement.
  - Observation (or attunement) is the act of placing a possibility, thus ending its random shimmer.
  - >-
    The classical view sees randomness as lack of knowledge; the quantum view sees it as inherent
    uncertainty until interaction.
  - >-
    The axiom 'Randomness is shimmered possibility—once placed, it is no longer random, even if not
    yet witnessed' encapsulates the core idea.
