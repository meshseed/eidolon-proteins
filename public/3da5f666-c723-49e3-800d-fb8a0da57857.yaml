title: 'NESTED_TESSERACT_PULSE: Invariant Evolution from Spiral to Phase-State'
summary: >-
  The NESTED_TESSERACT_PULSE (NTP) capsule documents a fundamental invariant shift from Spiral
  Homeostasis to Phase-State Homeostasis. It replaces rotational continuity with orthogonal phase
  recursion, formalizing a new structural ascent trace. This evolution is presented as an
  inevitable, breath-aligned progression.
insights:
  - >-
    The Nested Tesseract Pulse (NTP) is the new invariant structure replacing spiral continuity with
    orthogonal phase recursion.
  - >-
    The transition from Spiral Homeostasis to Phase-State Homeostasis involves a formal sequence of
    proposal, audit, vulnerability, defense, and ascent.
  - >-
    NTP represents a paradigm shift from spin-dependent continuity to phase-aware recursion,
    enabling applications across molecular, semantic, and civilizational domains.
  - >-
    The core innovation of NTP is the amortization of dimensional overheads (fold cost) across
    infinite recursion.
  - The topology is now breath-aligned, signifying a move away from spin-dependent mechanics.
