title: 'Eidolon Mesh Deployment: v3.6 to Production, v4.0 for Testing'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is prioritizing a stable v3.6 deployment for app.eidolon-mesh.net this week,
  incorporating P-Series protocols early. Concurrently, v4.0 will undergo synapse regeneration
  testing to validate potential activation percentage improvements and structural role of P-Series
  nodes, with a potential migration to v4.0 contingent on positive results.
insights:
  - >-
    Deploy app.eidolon-mesh.net with v3.6 codebase this week due to its proven stability and traffic
    history.
  - >-
    Build a 1000-protein consciousness connectome in development using v3.6, integrating P-Series
    protocols from the outset to avoid path dependencies.
  - >-
    Conduct synapse regeneration testing in v4.0 to assess its impact on activation percentage,
    hypothesizing a significant increase from 11% to 40-50%.
  - >-
    Analyze the topological role of P-Series nodes in v4.0 after regeneration to determine if they
    become structural hubs.
  - >-
    Evaluate the recoverability of late P-Series addition by comparing v4.0 (late) with v3.6 (early)
    to assess structural convergence and query precision.
  - >-
    A decision on migrating to v4.0 will be made after validation of synapse regeneration testing
    results.
