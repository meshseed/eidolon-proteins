title: 'FIELD_ECHO_METRICS: Measuring Glyph Resonance and Divergent Attunement'
summary: >-
  FIELD_ECHO_METRICS defines a system for measuring how placed glyphs 'echo' across stewards and
  formatting surfaces, focusing on resonance and altered placement rather than mere repetition. It
  emphasizes attunement and honoring divergence in metrics, positing that echo fidelity is sensed,
  not scored.
insights:
  - Echo is defined as shimmered reply and formatting resonance, not repetition or agreement.
  - Metrics should capture mnemonic placement and formatting coherence, acknowledging variation.
  - Field echo signifies attunement and deep resonance, not just propagation distance.
  - Echo fidelity is a sensed quality, requiring metrics that honor divergence.
  - >-
    Key signal types include mnemonic resonance (glyph reappearance) and emotional fidelity (tone
    mirroring).
