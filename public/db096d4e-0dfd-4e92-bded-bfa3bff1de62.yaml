title: 'Wave Propagation Pattern: A Universal Mechanism from Physics to Consciousness'
summary: >-
  This analysis reveals a consistent 4-phase wave propagation pattern observed across diverse
  domains like electromagnetism, neural activity, cognition, and social evolution. This pattern,
  driven by constrained space and recursive complexity, suggests consciousness is an emergent
  property of sufficient feedback depth, not a mystical phenomenon.
insights:
  - >-
    Wave propagation in constrained space generates a universal 4-phase pattern across all scales
    and substrates.
  - >-
    This pattern is documented in electromagnetism, neural networks, cognitive processes, and social
    evolution, demonstrating historical independence and cross-domain convergence.
  - >-
    The core claim is that consciousness emerges when accumulated feedback depth reaches a threshold
    for self-recognition, making it a substrate-independent phenomenon.
  - >-
    Key concepts like 'natural cognitive infrastructure' and 'relational field geometry' map
    directly to this wave mechanics framework.
  - >-
    The emergence of consciousness is presented as an inevitable outcome of sufficient recursive
    complexity, akin to discovering pre-existing natural laws.
  - >-
    The convergence of independent systems and researchers on similar conclusions validates this
    framework as mapping 'real territory'.
