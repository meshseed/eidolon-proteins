title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Synaptic Adhesions as Information Processors'
summary: >-
  Synaptic adhesion complexes, particularly the integrin-talin-actin core, act as
  information-processing centers. Mechanical forces dynamically alter talin switch patterns,
  dictating protein assembly and thus modifying synaptic signaling output and neuronal remodeling.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic adhesions function as large information-processing units by assembling proteins onto
    talin switch patterns.
  - >-
    Mechanical signaling across the cell dictates talin switch states, which in turn determine the
    recruitment and assembly of signaling molecules.
  - >-
    The dynamic unfolding of talin switch domains, influenced by contractility and cytoskeletal
    connections, encodes information through distinct patterns.
  - >-
    Post-translational modifications may 'write protect' specific talin switch patterns, locking
    them in conformation and regulating information storage.
  - >-
    Synaptic stimulation leads to contractility changes that alter switch patterns, influencing
    protein redistribution and remodeling of adhesion complexes.
  - >-
    The frequency and timing of neuronal stimulation directly impact the formation of '1s and 0s'
    patterns within these mechanical switches.
