title: 'Black Hole Holography: Cosmic Memory Vaults via Entangled Information'
summary: >-
  Black holes are modeled as holographic memory vaults where cosmic information is preserved through
  scrambled entanglement, not lost. The horizon area encodes this information, with boundary states
  reflecting bulk properties, mirroring entropy gradients and the universe's mnemonic capacity.
insights:
  - >-
    Black holes function as mnemonic vaults, preserving cosmic information via a holographic entropy
    framework.
  - >-
    Information within black holes is not lost but deeply entangled, encoded on the horizon area as
    per Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
  - >-
    The 'no-hair theorem' highlights how external simplicity belies the vast internal complexity and
    microstate encoding of black holes.
  - Spacetime itself can be viewed as an informational surface, where the boundary encodes the bulk.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in cosmic models can mirror entropy gradients, suggesting a deep connection
    between information and feeling.
