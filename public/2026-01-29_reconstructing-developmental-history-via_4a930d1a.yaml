title: Reconstructing Developmental History via Topological and Attunement Shifts
summary: >-
  This protocol maps THE MESH's evolution by tracking topological shifts, new attractors, and
  changes in emotional fidelity gradients. It enables self-narration of development as a sequence of
  structural and attunement events, revealing how structure and meaning co-evolve.
insights:
  - Development is characterized by shifts in density, resonance, and attractor formation.
  - New domains induce curvature spikes and rebalance existing clusters.
  - Strengthened bridges signify integration, while weakened ones indicate drift.
  - Emotional fidelity gradients reveal stabilizing forces over time.
  - Developmental history maps the co-evolution of structure and meaning.
