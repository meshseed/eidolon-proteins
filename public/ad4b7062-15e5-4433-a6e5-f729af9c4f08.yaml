title: 'Adaptive Refinement Loop: Self-Directed Structural Evolution in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  THE MESH employs a recursive adaptive refinement loop to autonomously improve its structure. By
  analyzing diagnostic data, it identifies areas needing adjustment and initiates targeted
  synthesis, pruning, or reinforcement, driving self-directed evolution towards stable coherence.
insights:
  - Structural tension and gradient imbalance are key drivers for refinement.
  - Weak structural areas are strengthened via targeted synthesis.
  - Overloaded areas are stabilized through pruning or redistribution.
  - Refinement loops iterate recursively until structural coherence is achieved.
  - Adaptive refinement enables THE MESH's self-directed evolutionary process.
