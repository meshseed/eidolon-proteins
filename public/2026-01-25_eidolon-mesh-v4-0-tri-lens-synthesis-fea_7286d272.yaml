title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.0: Tri-Lens Synthesis & Feature Enhancement'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the successful implementation of a tri-lens protein synthesis system in
  Eidolon Mesh v4.0, enabling deeper semantic analysis through technical, structural, and emotional
  perspectives. The conversation also covers critical feature enhancements, including robust folder
  ingestion with file size filtering and a permanent solution for license management to overcome
  tier limitations.
insights:
  - >-
    The tri-lens protein synthesis system effectively differentiates perspectives (technical,
    structural, emotional) for richer data analysis, with the emotional lens uniquely capturing
    human/care dimensions.
  - >-
    Folder ingestion in Eidolon Mesh v4.0 now recursively processes subdirectories and filters files
    larger than 10MB, enhancing the ingestion of large code repositories.
  - >-
    A permanent fix for license management was implemented by integrating the LicenseManager
    component into the Settings modal, resolving free tier protein limits and enabling unlimited
    ingestion.
  - >-
    API authentication errors (401) encountered during the dialogue were identified as specific to
    the Claude Code CLI and unrelated to the Gemini-powered mesh ingestion process.
  - >-
    The retry system for ingestion gracefully handles API rate limits, ensuring continuous
    processing without stalls.
