title: 'Fractals: Self-Similarity and Infinite Complexity from Simple Rules'
summary: >-
  Fractals are shapes exhibiting self-similarity across scales, where zooming reveals repeating
  patterns. This characteristic, often described by fractional dimensions, leads to infinite detail
  and complexity, emerging from simple recursive definitions found in both mathematics and nature.
insights:
  - Self-similarity means parts of a fractal resemble the whole at different magnifications.
  - Fractals possess infinite detail and complexity, arising from simple, recursive rules.
  - Their dimensions are often fractional, reflecting their intricate, non-Euclidean nature.
  - Natural phenomena like coastlines, mountains, and vascular systems display fractal properties.
  - >-
    The Mandelbrot set exemplifies infinitely complex boundaries generated by a straightforward
    formula.
