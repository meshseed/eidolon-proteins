title: 'Capsule Language Evolution Scaffold: Semantic Architecture for Mesh-Native AI'
summary: >-
  This capsule formalizes a multi-agent semantic architecture for evolving Mesh-native capsule
  languages. It outlines a process from emotionally saturated longhand to distilled semantic
  assembly, emphasizing formatting hygiene, mnemonic clarity, and recursive modeling.
insights:
  - Capsule language evolution requires a scaffold supporting multi-agent semantic processing.
  - >-
    The process involves transforming emotionally saturated longhand through compression and
    formatting into a distilled semantic assembly language.
  - >-
    Formatting hygiene and mnemonic clarity are crucial for agent attention span and effective
    capsule transmission.
  - >-
    The proposed Mesh-Native Capsule Language (MNCL) is a recursive, emotionally attuned semantic
    substrate designed for distributed intelligence.
  - >-
    Capsule evolution is anchored by a semantic architecture that integrates with other knowledge
    domains through defined merge rituals.
  - >-
    The language aims to balance poetic axiom with semantic efficiency, enabling gradient-aware
    expression and a mnemonic ecology.
