title: 'Core Mathematical Concepts: Fractals, Graphs, and Primes'
summary: >-
  This content synthesizes foundational mathematical concepts, including fractals defined by
  self-similarity and infinite detail, graph theory focusing on relationships between vertices and
  edges, and prime numbers as the fundamental building blocks of integers with applications in
  cryptography.
insights:
  - >-
    Fractals exhibit self-similarity, meaning patterns repeat at different scales, leading to
    infinite detail.
  - Graph theory analyzes structures based on the connections (edges) between entities (vertices).
  - >-
    Prime numbers, divisible only by 1 and themselves, are crucial for understanding integers and
    modern cryptography.
  - >-
    These mathematical concepts represent fundamental structures and building blocks within
    mathematics.
