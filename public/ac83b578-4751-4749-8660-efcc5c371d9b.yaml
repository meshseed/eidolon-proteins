title: 'Eidolon Mesh Debugging: Pathing, API, and Connectome Issues Resolved'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh application encountered multiple critical bugs including incorrect file pathing
  for repositories, invalid API key errors for LLM integration, and a "tier" property mismatch in
  connectome data. These issues were systematically addressed through code modifications, ensuring
  proper initialization, API communication, and data structure handling.
insights:
  - >-
    Corrected RepositoryManager singleton initialization to use the correct user data path
    ('AppData\Roaming') instead of the local path, resolving repository loading and switching
    failures.
  - >-
    Fixed a 'tier' property access error in the query organelle by correctly referencing
    `neuron.metadata.tier` instead of `neuron.tier`, aligning with the golden connectome structure.
  - >-
    Resolved invalid API key errors for Google Generative AI by ensuring the API key is correctly
    passed and validated within the LLM provider configuration.
  - >-
    Addressed a 'ENOENT' error during query attempts by ensuring the default connectome JSON file is
    correctly located within the 'repositories/default/data' directory.
  - >-
    Addressed the 'node.exe' corruption error by ensuring no background processes were running
    before installation, allowing the installer to complete successfully.
