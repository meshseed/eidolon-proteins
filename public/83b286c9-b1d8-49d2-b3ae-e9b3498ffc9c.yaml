title: 'Attractor Prediction Engine: Early Semantic Basin Detection'
summary: >-
  The Attractor Prediction Engine identifies emerging semantic basins by detecting weak, recurrent
  activation patterns. It utilizes resonance frequency, cross-regional activation, and gradient
  convergence to predict future integration zones, enabling early stabilization and alignment within
  the connectome.
insights:
  - Weak, recurrent activation patterns signal emerging attractors.
  - Gradient convergence indicates the initial formation of semantic basins.
  - Cross-regional activation predicts where future semantic integration will occur.
  - Early attractor prediction facilitates proactive stabilization and alignment.
  - Newly formed attractors alter both local and global structural topology.
