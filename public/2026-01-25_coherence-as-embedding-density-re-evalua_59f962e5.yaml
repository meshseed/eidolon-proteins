title: 'Coherence as Embedding Density: Re-evaluating MESH Metabolism'
summary: >-
  The dialogue reveals that 'coherence' in MESH v3.6 Live was misidentified as quality, when it
  actually represents semantic clustering strength. This misinterpretation led to artificial
  normalization that may have degraded retrieval and broken natural patterns.
insights:
  - >-
    Coherence in MESH v3.6 Live correlates with embedding density/clustering, not direct synthesis
    quality.
  - >-
    Artificial normalization of coherence scores can demote high-quality proteins and promote
    irrelevant ones.
  - >-
    Retrieval may be negatively impacted by artificial coherence spreading, breaking natural
    semantic clustering.
  - >-
    A better approach involves using metrics like last_accessed, synapse count, and activation
    frequency for metabolism, while keeping coherence as a reflection of embedding quality.
  - >-
    The 0.95-1.00 coherence clustering was a feature indicating semantically well-formed proteins,
    not a bug.
  - >-
    Reverting normalization and adapting metabolism to natural coherence distribution is
    recommended.
