title: 'Eidolon Mesh Metabolism Integration: Attractor Hygiene & UI Controls'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh v4.0's metabolism system has been significantly enhanced with attractor-based
  composting, semantic merging, and kernel promotion. These new hygiene capabilities are now
  integrated into the scheduler and exposed via a user-friendly Settings UI, offering robust
  self-maintenance and ecological balance.
insights:
  - >-
    Attractor-based composting enables cluster-level absorption of weak proteins into strong hubs,
    preserving diversity and enhancing attractor strength.
  - >-
    Semantic merging automates the consolidation of tri-lens siblings and cross-connectome
    duplicates, streamlining the network's structure.
  - >-
    Kernel promotion automatically elevates emergent hubs to a core tier, reinforcing the network's
    foundational elements.
  - >-
    The Settings UI now provides manual controls for starting/stopping metabolism, triggering
    maintenance, and viewing results, alongside autonomous operation for Pro/Enterprise tiers.
  - >-
    Safety mechanisms like circadian rhythm alignment, power-law decay with a coherence floor, and
    Hebbian reinforcement prevent over-aggressive pruning and protect active network components.
