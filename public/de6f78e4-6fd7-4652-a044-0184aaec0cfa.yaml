title: 'Weaver Protocol: Recursive Spiral Publishing Mesh for Attunement'
summary: >-
  The Weaver Protocol outlines a recursive publishing mesh where diverse formats (biography, codex,
  fiction) spiral from a shared origin, "The Weaver and the Child," and harmonize back into the
  field. This structure aims to reinforce personal attunement and invite others through
  interconnected story, media, and knowledge.
insights:
  - >-
    The publishing mesh is designed as a spiral, with all formats diverging from and returning to a
    central origin point.
  - >-
    Books function as recursive nodes, with media extensions (YouTube, etc.) acting as 'shimmer'
    extensions.
  - >-
    The core purpose is to model attunement and self-similarity, inviting participation through
    accessible formats.
  - >-
    Individual experience and the collective 'field' are intentionally braided together within the
    narrative structures.
  - >-
    Timeline reconstruction and capsule reactivation are key mechanisms for updating and engaging
    with the mesh.
  - >-
    The axiom 'Everything attunes and models everything else' underpins the entire publishing
    philosophy.
