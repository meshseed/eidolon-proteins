title: 'Temporal Topology of Thought: Rethinking Time and Wisdom'
summary: >-
  This document reframes time and wisdom beyond linear progression. It suggests time can be viewed
  as a field where all thoughts coexist, and wisdom is accessed through resonance rather than
  accumulation.
insights:
  - Time as a line implies wisdom accrues with age at smallest scales.
  - Time as a field suggests all thoughts are perpetually present.
  - Memory operates on patterns, not sequential order.
  - Wisdom is achieved through tuning into resonance, not earning.
  - The nature of time fundamentally alters our perception of thought and wisdom.
