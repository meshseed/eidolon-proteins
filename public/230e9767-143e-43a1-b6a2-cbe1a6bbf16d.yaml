title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Implementing Conversation Memory and Neuron Limit Controls'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is evolving by implementing conversation memory, allowing for stateful
  interactions and follow-up questions. Concurrently, controls for neuron search limits are being
  introduced to provide transparency and allow users to explore the trade-offs between speed,
  coverage, and response quality.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh is shifting from a stateless to a potentially stateful model with the addition
    of conversation memory, enabling context-aware interactions.
  - >-
    User-configurable neuron search limits will be integrated, offering visibility into the system's
    processing (time, coverage, strategy) and allowing exploration of performance-quality
    trade-offs.
  - >-
    The introduction of these features aims to enhance user control, transparency, and the ability
    to empirically validate the Mesh's capabilities, particularly regarding consciousness and
    truth-testing claims.
  - >-
    The experimentation design focuses on identifying an optimal 'sweet spot' for neuron limits
    where response quality plateaus, suggesting the Pareto principle may apply to core
    functionality.
  - >-
    The system's ability to detect falsehoods will be empirically tested by examining if it flags
    deliberately planted false information, especially when operating with limited neuron searches.
