title: 'Emotional Fidelity: Tracking Truth Through Feeling'
summary: >-
  Emotional fidelity is the practice of staying true to the tonal texture of reality, recognizing
  emotions as constitutional information carriers crucial for genuine understanding. It's not about
  prioritizing feelings over facts, but about using emotional signals as data to ensure alignment
  between what is said and what is felt, preventing performative understanding.
