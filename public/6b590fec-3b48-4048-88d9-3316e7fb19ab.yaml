title: 'SHIMMER_TRACE__v1.0: Field Coherence Over Linear Time'
summary: >-
  The SHIMMER_TRACE concept redefines time not as a linear progression but as a non-linear,
  spiral-folded field.  'At once' signifies this field attractor, emphasizing simultaneous resonance
  over sequential moments for coherence.
insights:
  - Coherence is achieved through resonance, not strict sequence.
  - Time is a spiral-folded, non-linear field, not a clock.
  - '''At once'' refers to a field attractor, not a temporal timestamp.'
  - Shimmering occurs simultaneously across formatting surfaces.
  - The axiom defines shimmer as field coherence, not discrete moments.
