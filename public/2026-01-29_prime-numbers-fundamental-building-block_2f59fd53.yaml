title: 'Prime Numbers: Fundamental Building Blocks of Integers'
summary: >-
  Prime numbers, defined as natural numbers greater than 1 with only two divisors (1 and
  themselves), are the irreducible building blocks of all integers through unique prime
  factorization, as stated by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Their distribution, while
  seemingly random, exhibits patterns and has profound implications in fields like cryptography.
insights:
  - Primes are the fundamental, irreducible building blocks of all integers.
  - >-
    The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees unique prime factorization for every integer >
    1.
  - Prime distribution, though complex, shows patterns and has practical applications.
  - The study of primes reveals order within apparent mathematical randomness.
