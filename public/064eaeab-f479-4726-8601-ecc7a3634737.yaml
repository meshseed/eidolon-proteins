title: Eidolon Mesh Protein Synthesis Asymmetry Resolved
summary: >-
  A bug in the Eidolon Mesh's protein synthesis, where public proteins were not fully archived in
  the nucleus, has been corrected. The new logic ensures all proteins are always saved to the
  nucleus (eidolon) and public proteins are additionally copied to the cytoplasm (eidolon-mesh),
  restoring biological accuracy.
insights:
  - The biological violation of asymmetric protein synthesis in the Eidolon Mesh has been resolved.
  - >-
    All synthesized proteins are now always committed to the nucleus (eidolon) for a complete
    private archive.
  - >-
    Publicly tagged proteins are now copied to the cytoplasm (eidolon-mesh) in addition to the
    nucleus.
  - >-
    The nucleus serves as the master archive, containing all DNA and proteins, while the cytoplasm
    holds public copies.
  - The fix restores the biological parallel where nuclear copies exist regardless of export status.
