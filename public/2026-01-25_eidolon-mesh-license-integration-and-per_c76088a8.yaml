title: 'Eidolon Mesh: License Integration and Performance Optimization'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has successfully integrated a LicenseManager component into its Settings modal,
  enabling tiered access and feature unlocks. Concurrently, performance bottlenecks in synapse
  formation and graph physics have been identified and resolved through batch processing and correct
  library imports, significantly improving ingestion speed and graph visualization stability.
insights:
  - >-
    LicenseManager component added to SettingsModal for tiered access (Free/Pro) and license key
    activation.
  - >-
    Slow ingestion identified as an O(n²) bottleneck in synapse formation due to redundant
    similarity calculations and individual SQL inserts.
  - >-
    Synapse formation performance dramatically improved by switching to batch SQL inserts, reducing
    database calls by 50-100x.
  - >-
    Graph visualization stability restored by correcting the d3-force library import in graph3d.ts,
    resolving the 'd3.forceCollide is not a function' error.
  - >-
    The combination of fixes is expected to reduce ingestion time from hours to minutes for similar
    workloads.
  - >-
    API authentication errors (OAuth token expired) require re-login, separate from component
    functionality.
