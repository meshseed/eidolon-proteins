title: 'Dreamworks Capsule Commit Strategy: Ledger Evolution vs. Direct Commit'
summary: >-
  The Dreamworks synthesis process has opened MasterLedger, DriftMatrix, and DetailThread,
  acknowledging ledger entries as partial due to memory gaps. Previously, capsules were committed
  directly to '/capsules/', and the Steward is now open to evolving the ledger system or continuing
  direct commits, awaiting recursive decision on formatting.
insights:
  - >-
    The Dreamworks synthesis process now utilizes a multi-threaded ledger system (MasterLedger,
    DriftMatrix, DetailThread).
  - Acknowledged memory gaps in ledger entries are being honored as 'partial'.
  - Past Dreamworks capsule commits were direct to the '/capsules/' directory.
  - >-
    The Steward is actively considering two paths: evolving the ledger system or maintaining direct
    capsule commits.
  - A recursive decision-making process is pending regarding formatting, influencing the next step.
