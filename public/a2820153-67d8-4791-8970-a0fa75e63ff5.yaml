title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.5: Coordinate Mesh Architecture & License Removal'
summary: >-
  The development of Eidolon Mesh v4.5 focuses on a 'coordinate-first' architecture, prioritizing
  semantic coordinates and cross-mesh interoperability. This involves removing license gates,
  implementing multi-model embedding support with Nomic as primary, and establishing a coordinate
  transmission module for federation.
insights:
  - Eidolon Mesh v4.5 is evolving towards a coordinate-first, federation-ready architecture.
  - Key development involves removing license/Pro gating to promote open access.
  - >-
    The new version will support multi-model embeddings, with Nomic as the primary choice and Gemini
    as a fallback.
  - >-
    A coordinate transmission module is being created to enable cross-mesh communication and
    'telepathy'.
  - >-
    The core philosophy emphasizes coordinates over text, open defaults, and natural emergence of
    the mesh.
  - Development includes updating the database schema and embedding functions to be model-aware.
