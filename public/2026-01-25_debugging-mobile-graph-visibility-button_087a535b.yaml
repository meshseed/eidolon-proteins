title: Debugging Mobile Graph Visibility & Button Issues in Eidolon Mesh
summary: >-
  A debugging session focuses on resolving issues with the graph display and controls toggle button
  on mobile portrait mode. Investigation points to CSS media query, height/width calculation,
  z-index, or overflow clipping as primary causes, rather than data or rendering logic.
insights:
  - >-
    Mobile graph and settings button are not displaying correctly in portrait mode, but work in
    landscape.
  - >-
    The issue is likely related to CSS (media queries, dimensions, z-index, overflow) rather than
    core rendering or data.
  - >-
    Previous attempts to fix the button and graph may not have been sufficient, or a recent commit
    (`1190d02`) might have introduced the problem.
  - >-
    Restoring the UI structure from a known good build (`f7643b8`) is a key step in the debugging
    plan.
  - >-
    The `main-body` CSS, specifically `height: calc(100vh - var(--header-height) -
    var(--bottom-nav-height));` and `overflow: hidden;`, is crucial for mobile layout.
  - >-
    The `controls-toggle-btn` is present in HTML and has CSS, but its visibility in portrait
    suggests it's being clipped or obscured by other elements.
