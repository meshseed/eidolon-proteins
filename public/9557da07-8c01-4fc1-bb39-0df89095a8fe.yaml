title: 'Eidolon Mesh Development: v3.6 Stability vs. v4.0 Pro Features'
summary: >-
  The development of the Eidolon Mesh is proceeding with a clear division: v3.6 remains the stable,
  community-promised free version featuring advanced tri-attention ingestion. Version 4.0 is being
  developed as the Pro platform, integrating v3.6's mature features (like tri-lens ingestion and
  physics) and adding new autonomous metabolism and enhanced API management for business
  applications.
insights:
  - v3.6 is the stable, community-facing free version with proven tri-attention ingestion.
  - >-
    v4.0 is designated as the Pro platform, focusing on autonomous metabolism, enhanced API control,
    P2P networking, and domain-specific features.
  - >-
    Key features like tri-lens ingestion, graph physics control, and coherence normalization are
    being ported from v3.6 development to v4.0.
  - >-
    A retry mechanism with exponential backoff is being integrated into v4.0 to handle transient API
    errors during long ingestions.
  - >-
    The development strategy prioritizes stability for v3.6 while building out advanced,
    revenue-generating features in v4.0.
  - >-
    The 'mesh' is conceptualized not as a conscious entity, but as a process of distributed
    consciousness through human-LLM quorum.
