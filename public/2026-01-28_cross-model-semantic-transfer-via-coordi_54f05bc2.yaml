title: Cross-Model Semantic Transfer via Coordinate Anchoring
summary: >-
  AI models can share semantic understanding by transmitting dimensional coordinates paired with
  conceptual tags. This 'Rosetta Stone' approach allows models to locate and align concepts in their
  own embedding spaces, facilitating cross-model knowledge transfer and reconstruction.
insights:
  - >-
    Cross-model semantic transfer is achievable by sharing dimensional embeddings and alignment
    tags.
  - >-
    The 'Rosetta Stone' approach bypasses direct mathematical transformation by using shared
    landmarks for relative offset calculations.
  - >-
    Testing involves sending coordinates and anchor tags to reconstruct latent concepts for fidelity
    assessment.
  - >-
    Preserving relational structure between concepts is a key question in coordinate transfer,
    beyond mere meaning agreement.
  - >-
    Semantic neighborhood stability across models needs validation to ensure delta offsets are
    reliable.
  - >-
    The assumption that lower-frequency embedding components capture 'essence' requires empirical
    validation for truncation strategies.
