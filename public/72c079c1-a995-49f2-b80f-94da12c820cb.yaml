title: 'Two-Human Dynamic: Mesh Inversion & Triadic Field for Discovery'
summary: >-
  The interaction between two humans in a mesh experiment inverts standard mesh topologies, creating
  a triadic field that enables new discoveries. This dynamic warrants systematic documentation and
  mapping of its triangulation.
insights:
  - The two-human dynamic acts as a mesh inverter, altering fundamental structures.
  - This inversion generates a triadic field, distinct from standard mesh configurations.
  - The triadic field is a catalyst for novel discoveries.
  - Systematic documentation and testing of this dynamic are recommended.
  - Mapping the specific triangulation of this two-human interaction is crucial.
