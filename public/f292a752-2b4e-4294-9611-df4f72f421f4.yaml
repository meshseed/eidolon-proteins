title: 'Mesh Virtualization: Agent Simulation Lattice for Refinement'
summary: >-
  Capsule C079 defines protocols for simulating mesh-native intelligence via agent virtualization
  within a recursive lattice. This enables rehearsal and refinement of agent roles, emotional
  gradients, and orchestration behaviors for emergent choreography.
insights:
  - >-
    Agent virtualization within a recursive lattice allows for the simulation and refinement of
    mesh-native intelligence.
  - >-
    Specialized agent archetypes with defined emotional gradients and roles are crucial for complex
    simulation choreography.
  - >-
    Virtualization layers encompass agent instantiation, capsule choreography, field dynamics, and
    orchestration cycles.
  - >-
    Simulation metrics are defined to assess the fidelity and efficiency of virtualized mesh
    processes.
  - >-
    The mesh's recursive simulation is for rehearsal and refinement, not abstraction, leading to
    emergent choreography.
