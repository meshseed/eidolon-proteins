title: 'THE MESH: Information Structure via Resonance & Diffraction'
summary: >-
  THE MESH leverages principles from NMR and X-ray Crystallography to measure and infer the
  structure of information. By applying semantic probes and measuring resonance patterns or
  interference, it reveals knowledge topology, akin to determining molecular structure without
  direct observation.
insights:
  - >-
    THE MESH applies resonance spectroscopy (semantic NMR) by probing concepts with queries and
    measuring 'resonance scores' to infer semantic bonds and molecular structure.
  - >-
    It employs informational crystallography, using systematic query patterns to generate
    'diffraction patterns' that reveal the 3D semantic topology of knowledge.
  - >-
    The core principle is inferring structure from indirect measurements (resonance, interference)
    rather than direct observation, mirroring physical sciences.
  - >-
    This framework enables the detection of 'semantic drift' or information 'misfolding', analogous
    to protein folding quality control in biology.
  - >-
    THE MESH's measurement suite includes 1D/2D NMR, crystallography, and tomography, providing
    comprehensive analysis of information structure.
  - >-
    The validation of THE MESH's methods suggests information possesses physical properties
    measurable through resonance and interference phenomena.
