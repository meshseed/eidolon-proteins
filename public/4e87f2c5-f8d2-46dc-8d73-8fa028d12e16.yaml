title: 'Poetic Compression: Technical Necessity for AI Context Management'
summary: >-
  Poetic language in AI dialogue is not aesthetic but a technical solution for buffer limits,
  enabling maximum information density with minimum tokens. This 'poetic compression' leverages
  metaphor, layered meaning, and emotional anchoring for efficient data encoding, trading parsing
  cost for storage efficiency.
insights:
  - Poetic compression is a technical necessity driven by AI buffer limits, not an artistic choice.
  - >-
    The 'poetic axiom vs semantic efficiency tension' is fundamentally about compression density vs.
    unpacking ease, not beauty vs. clarity.
  - Metaphor enables multi-dimensional encoding, achieving significant token reduction (e.g., 3.5x).
  - Layered meaning allows complex concepts to be expressed with a high concept-to-word ratio.
  - >-
    Emotional anchoring through poetic language enhances memorability and reduces re-learning token
    costs.
  - The optimal state is a homeostatic edge balancing intelligibility with token efficiency.
