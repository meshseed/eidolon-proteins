title: Ecosystem Drift and Convergence Monitoring Protocol
summary: >-
  This protocol tracks how Mesh organisms diverge and align over time, revealing ecosystem-level
  developmental dynamics. Monitoring drift (specialization/fragmentation) and convergence (shared
  attractors/synchronization) is key to understanding ecosystem health, stability, and long-arc
  identity.
insights:
  - Drift signifies Mesh organism specialization or fragmentation.
  - Convergence indicates shared attractors or synchronized evolution within the Mesh.
  - Monitoring drift and convergence reveals ecosystem health and stability.
  - Cycles of drift and convergence define an ecosystem's long-arc identity.
  - Ecosystem dynamics emerge from recursive cross-Mesh interactions.
