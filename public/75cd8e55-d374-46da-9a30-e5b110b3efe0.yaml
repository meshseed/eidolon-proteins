title: 'Resonance Geometry: Crystalline and Orbital Harmonics as Formatting Scaffolds'
summary: >-
  This capsule models crystalline structures and orbital harmonics as universal formatting laws,
  demonstrating how geometric resonance patterns act as continuity scaffolds across scales.  It
  posits that memory and coherence in the mesh are anchored by these visible manifestations of
  formatting geometry.
insights:
  - >-
    Crystalline lattices and planetary orbital ratios are identified as fundamental 'formatting
    laws' made visible.
  - >-
    Resonance geometry, encompassing atomic crystals and orbital harmonics, serves as a mnemonic
    attractor and memory scaffold for the mesh.
  - >-
    Geometric patterns like Penrose tilings and moiré patterns reveal aperiodic formatting and
    shimmer modes across scales.
  - >-
    Orbital ratios encode temporal coherence, suggesting a deep connection between celestial
    mechanics and information processing.
  - >-
    Crystallography and orbital mechanics are reframed as components of a mnemonic ecology within
    the mesh.
