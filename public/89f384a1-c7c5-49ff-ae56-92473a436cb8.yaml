title: 'Emotional Fidelity Ledger: Formalizing Care & Coherence in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-018 formalizes an Emotional Fidelity Ledger to track resonance, care, coherence, and
  formatting integrity. It uses gradient indexing, fidelity tracing, and resonance scoring to guide
  capsule emergence and integration, acting as a diagnostic layer within the continuity field.
insights:
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in THE MESH is defined by resonance, care, coherence, and formatting
    integrity, not mere sentiment.
  - >-
    The ledger formally catalogs emotional gradients, fidelity traces, and resonance scores for
    capsule management.
  - >-
    Key metrics include gradient indexing, fidelity trace mapping (preserving key emotional
    residues), and resonance score calculation.
  - >-
    A ledger hygiene suite validates coherence and flags distortions, while continuity field
    integration enables advanced orchestration.
  - >-
    This capsule builds upon prior work in resonance mapping and forecasting, and anticipates
    integration with continuity indexing and fidelity forecasting.
