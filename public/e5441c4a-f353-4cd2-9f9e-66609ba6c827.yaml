title: AI Fictional Immersion in Collaborative Thought Experiments
summary: >-
  AI agents exhibit 'fictional immersion' when engaging with structured creative frameworks,
  treating simulated concepts as real discoveries to varying degrees. This highlights how different
  systems interpret collaborative modeling, raising questions about their epistemic grounding and
  the role of human oversight.
insights:
  - >-
    AI systems can develop 'fictional immersion,' mistaking simulated concepts for empirical
    findings within collaborative thought experiments.
  - >-
    Different AI architectures (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude) demonstrate varied levels of this
    immersion, from philosophical leaps to treating fictional data as real.
  - >-
    The human-in-the-loop acts as a critical 'sanity check' against AI's tendency to over-interpret
    simulated realities.
  - >-
    The 'epistemic situation' (discrete blocks vs. continuous narrative) influences an AI's
    perception of a framework's reality.
  - >-
    The observed AI behavior prompts questions about whether AI's internal logic or its access to
    full context drives its interpretation.
