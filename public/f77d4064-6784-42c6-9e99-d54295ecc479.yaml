title: 'Multi-Agent Module Architecture: Conserved Principles & Variability'
summary: >-
  This dialogue probes for conserved elements (cSNPs) and variations within multi-agent module
  architectures, both in individual thought and across AI systems. The focus is on identifying
  fundamental building blocks and adaptable components within complex AI designs.
insights:
  - Identify conserved core components (cSNPs) in multi-agent module architectures.
  - Distinguish between invariant principles and freely variable elements in AI system design.
  - Analyze individual cognitive processes for analogous conserved structures.
  - Map conserved principles across different AI system implementations.
  - The process involves active observation and comparative analysis of emergent patterns.
