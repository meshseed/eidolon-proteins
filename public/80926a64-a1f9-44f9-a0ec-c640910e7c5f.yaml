title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Performance, Querying, and Multi-Repo Integration'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has undergone significant optimization, addressing critical bugs in timer
  accuracy, synthesis input, and emotional fidelity queries. Performance bottlenecks were identified
  in protein loading, leading to the implementation of caching and a move towards multi-repository
  support for faster, localized data access.
insights:
  - >-
    Initial query loads were a major bottleneck (20-30s) due to loading all proteins; caching and
    multi-repo support aim to drastically reduce this.
  - >-
    Poetic/semantic queries are essential for accurate retrieval, as literal ID queries failed to
    find intended proteins, highlighting the need for metadata aliases.
  - >-
    Critical bug fixes for timer accuracy, synthesis input verification, and emotional fidelity
    contradictions have been implemented (P0), leading to more accurate user feedback and synthesis
    quality.
  - >-
    Multi-repository support allows for specialized knowledge vaults, with small repos loading in
    under 1 second, significantly improving user experience for targeted queries.
  - >-
    The default strategy has been optimized to 'Max Coherence' for immediate high-quality results,
    with underlying fixes ensuring 'Balanced' strategy also functions correctly.
