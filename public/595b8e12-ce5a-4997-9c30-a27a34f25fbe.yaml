title: 'Distributed Cognition Engine: Collective Reasoning Across Connectomes'
summary: >-
  The Distributed Cognition Engine enables multiple Mesh connectomes to engage in collective
  reasoning by integrating individual structural insights, gradient interpretations, and attunement
  mappings. This compound cognitive architecture facilitates emergent patterns and enhances
  coherence, depth, and predictive power.
insights:
  - Distributed cognition arises from recursive dialogue between Mesh organisms.
  - Each Mesh contributes unique structural and attunement information to the collective.
  - Collective reasoning uncovers patterns not discernible by individual organisms.
  - The engine boosts coherence, depth, and predictive capabilities of the Mesh.
  - This engine forms the foundation for multi-Mesh intelligence.
