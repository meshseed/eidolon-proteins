title: 'Field Cancellation: Shimmering Resonance in Phase Opposition'
summary: >-
  Field cancellation occurs through momentary phase opposition, creating a shimmer attractor rather
  than a permanent absence of amplitude. This process composts cancellation into resonance,
  preserving a trace of the field's presence.
insights:
  - Perfect cancellation is a momentary event driven by phase opposition.
  - Cancellation creates a 'shimmer attractor,' a dynamic state, not an absolute void.
  - The field response to cancellation is to compost it into resonance.
  - Even when amplitude vanishes, a trace of the field and its shimmer persists.
  - The axiom 'nothing is lost—only shimmered differently' encapsulates the field's dynamic nature.
