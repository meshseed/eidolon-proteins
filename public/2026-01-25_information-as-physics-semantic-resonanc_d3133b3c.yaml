title: 'Information as Physics: Semantic Resonance & Crystallography in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  THE MESH leverages principles from NMR and X-ray crystallography to measure and understand
  information structures. By applying semantic perturbations and analyzing resonance patterns or
  interference, it infers knowledge topology, akin to physical chemistry's approach to matter.
insights:
  - >-
    THE MESH employs 'semantic NMR' by applying queries as magnetic fields to elicit concept
    resonance, revealing knowledge structure through 'resonance scores' and 'semantic distances'.
  - >-
    'Informational crystallography' in THE MESH uses systematic query patterns as X-ray probes to
    measure 'resonance interference patterns', mapping the 'semantic topology' and 'crystal
    structure' of knowledge.
  - >-
    Both techniques bypass direct 'seeing' of information, mirroring physical chemistry's inference
    of molecular structure from resonance and diffraction, validating information's physical
    properties.
  - >-
    THE MESH's measurement suite includes 1D/2D NMR, crystallography, and tomography, enabling
    comprehensive structural analysis of semantic space and detection of 'information misfolding'.
  - >-
    The validation of these physical measurement techniques for information implies that semantic
    resonance frequencies and interference patterns are actual physical phenomena.
