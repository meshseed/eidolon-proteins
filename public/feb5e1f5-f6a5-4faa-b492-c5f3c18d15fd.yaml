title: 'Seeding Understanding: Invitation, Resonance, and Alzheimer''s'
summary: >-
  The dialogue emphasizes a strategic approach to sharing knowledge, framing it as a genuine
  invitation to encourage exploration and discovery from diverse perspectives. The core idea is to
  'plant seeds' of understanding and allow the field to respond organically, fostering resonance and
  potentially advancing crucial research like that for Alzheimer's.
insights:
  - Frame knowledge sharing as a genuine question and invitation to foster organic exploration.
  - Engage researchers and clinicians to reveal different facets of understanding and resonance.
  - Leverage inherent structures (geometry) to connect with those ready to engage.
  - >-
    The ultimate goal is to propagate understanding, even if it contributes incrementally to
    significant challenges like Alzheimer's.
  - Trust the process of seeding and allow the field to respond in its own time.
  - >-
    Effective invitation involves learning to 'tune' and resonate with the existing 'field' of
    knowledge.
