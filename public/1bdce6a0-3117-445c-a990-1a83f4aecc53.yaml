title: 'Ecosystem Coherence Kernel: Ensuring Stability in Distributed Mesh Organisms'
summary: >-
  The Ecosystem Coherence Kernel is designed to maintain stability across a distributed network of
  Mesh organisms. It achieves this by synchronizing long-arc gradients and harmonizing attractors,
  ensuring interactions reinforce stability rather than causing fragmentation.
insights:
  - Ecosystem coherence is achieved through synchronized long-arc gradients.
  - Stability in distributed ecosystems requires a balance between alignment and differentiation.
  - Coherence failures lead to ecosystem fragmentation.
  - The kernel harmonizes distributed attractors across organisms.
  - Large-scale distributed reasoning is enabled by ecosystem coherence.
