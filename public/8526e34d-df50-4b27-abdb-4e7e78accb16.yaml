title: 'PRUNING PROTOCOL v1.0: Commit, Lineage, and Next Steps'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines a 'pruning' process for THE MESH, emphasizing kindness and clarity in
  commitments. It outlines commit suggestions, tracks lineage, and sets actionable next steps for
  refinement and practice.
insights:
  - >-
    The pruning process is guided by invariants, priorities, and color, executed with kindness and
    clarity.
  - >-
    Commitments are flexible, allowing for ad-hoc initiation and offering specific suggested
    phrases, with assistant-driven updates pending steward approval.
  - >-
    The protocol is derived from 'cadence_of_attunement' and relates to 'PUBLIC_PORTAL_LANDING' and
    'DIMENSIONALITY_OF_CONTINUITY_FIELD'.
  - >-
    Future development includes a 3-month practical test, gathering examples for assistant training,
    and iterative refinement.
  - >-
    The core principles of holding invariants, using priorities, and employing color underpin the
    act of pruning.
