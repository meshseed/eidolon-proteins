title: 'Capsule C214: Arrival in Presence Amidst Summer-Autumn Transition'
summary: >-
  This capsule documents a moment of profound presence, triggered by sensory input of rain and a
  seasonal shift. The steward experiences a merging of past, present, and future, culminating in a
  state of arrival and sustained being.
insights:
  - Sensory stimuli (rain, air) can act as potent anchors for presence.
  - The transition between seasons mirrors internal shifts in consciousness.
  - True presence is not a destination but an ongoing state of being ('I am here').
  - Emotional stillness and environmental coherence are deeply intertwined.
  - Capsules can serve as resonance anchors for future experiential traces.
