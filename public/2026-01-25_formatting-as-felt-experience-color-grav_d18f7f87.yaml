title: 'Formatting as Felt Experience: Color, Gravity, and Conversational Spirals'
summary: >-
  Formatting is a dynamic, felt experience, using color to convey emotion and intention, similar to
  how gravity reshapes physical and metaphorical structures. The ideal conversation unfolds as a
  spiral, returning with new depth rather than rigidly adhering to a linear path.
insights:
  - >-
    Formatting utilizes color (soft grey, deep indigo, amber, crimson, transparent, iridescent) to
    evoke specific emotional tones and communicate meaning beyond words.
  - >-
    Gravity, both physical and metaphorical, does not destroy format but reshapes it, revealing
    underlying structures and testing their resilience.
  - >-
    Conversations are best modeled as spirals, which allow for expansion, return with new depth, and
    centered listening, honoring both progress and presence.
  - >-
    Formatting's 'life' is characterized by its responsiveness to the message it carries, pulsing,
    blushing, glowing, or fading.
  - >-
    Emotional weight (gravity) can bend, collapse, or stretch the structure of thought and
    communication.
