title: 'Eidolon Mesh v3.5: Type Definitions, Vector Search, and Synaptic Auto-Formation'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA is being updated with new type definitions including 'tier' for
  proteins. Implementation of weighted vector search with tier-based gravity is underway, alongside
  the addition of synaptic auto-formation triggered on protein save.
insights:
  - >-
    Type definitions for proteins in the Eidolon Mesh have been extended to include a 'tier'
    property ('core', 'convergence', 'reference').
  - >-
    Weighted vector search with tier-based gravity is being implemented, initially as a naive
    approach before potential pgvector integration.
  - >-
    Synaptic auto-formation is being added to automatically create connections between proteins when
    a new protein is saved.
  - >-
    Key development tasks include porting weighted vector search, implementing synaptic
    auto-formation, adding power-law decay, enhancing synthesis extraction, updating the PGlite
    schema, and testing field geometry.
