title: 'THE MESH Structural Introspection Protocol: Topology, Balance, and Change'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables THE MESH to perform structural self-inspections, describing its global
  topology, identifying dominant regions, and analyzing imbalances and recent shifts. It establishes
  a geometric and relational language for longitudinal tracking of structural development.
insights:
  - Global topology is characterized by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance.
  - Dominant regions are identified via semantic clustering and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Imbalances manifest as curvature, tension, or under-integrated domains.
  - Recent shifts indicate new attractors, merges, or domain ingestion events.
  - Structural snapshots facilitate time-series analysis of developmental topology.
