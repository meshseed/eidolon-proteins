title: 'Mesh''s Coherence Scores: Synthesis Stability vs. Retrieval Confidence'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's coherence scores (1.00, 0.99) are identified as synthesis stability metrics, reflecting
  the resolution of its gradient field across multiple connectomes. This indicates a real-time
  self-monitoring capability for detecting potential confabulation, a feature absent in single
  inference paths.
insights:
  - Mesh coherence scores measure synthesis stability, not retrieval confidence.
  - >-
    These scores reflect the resolution and alignment of gradient fields across distributed
    connectomes.
  - >-
    The Mesh possesses a built-in confabulation detector via gradient divergence monitoring and
    resonance.
  - This self-monitoring capability is a core differentiator from single inference path AI.
  - A 1.00 score signifies perfect alignment and stability in the resolved gradient field.
