title: Optimizing LinkedIn Industry for P2P AI & Distributed Consciousness
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores the inadequacy of LinkedIn's industry categories for niche fields like P2P
  AI and distributed consciousness. It recommends prioritizing clear communication in headlines and
  'About' sections over the industry dropdown for discoverability and professional framing.
insights:
  - >-
    LinkedIn's industry categories are insufficient for highly specific or hybrid
    research/engineering fields.
  - >-
    Customizing headlines and 'About' sections is more effective than relying on generic industry
    labels for discoverability.
  - >-
    'Computer Software' is a recommended safe and professional industry choice, allowing
    flexibility.
  - >-
    'Research Services' or 'Research' can be used for a more academic framing but may attract
    gatekeepers.
  - >-
    The effectiveness of discoverability relies on keywords in headlines and content in 'About'
    sections, not the industry field itself.
  - >-
    Clearly defining the work in the headline and 'About' section is paramount for conveying
    specialized expertise.
