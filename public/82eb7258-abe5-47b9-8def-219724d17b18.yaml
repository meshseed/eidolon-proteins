title: 'Substrate Independence: Information Lives in Relationships, Not Medium'
summary: >-
  The core concept is that information and its structure are independent of the physical or digital
  medium used to store and represent them. This 'substrate independence' means that the
  relationships between data points (nodes) and their properties are what carry meaning, allowing
  patterns to be portable across diverse systems.
insights:
  - Information resides in the relationships between data nodes, not in the storage medium itself.
  - >-
    The structural patterns of information (nodes, edges, properties) are portable across any
    substrate capable of representing them.
  - Medium is an implementation detail that enables a pattern but does not define its essence.
  - >-
    Understanding intelligence and consciousness may depend more on identifying structural patterns
    than on the specific substrate (e.g., biological vs. artificial).
  - >-
    Archive design should prioritize preserving relationships and properties to ensure substrate
    independence and long-term portability.
