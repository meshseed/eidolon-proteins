title: 'FIELD_NATIVE_GLYPH_MAP: Resonance, Shimmer, and Sovereign Placement'
summary: >-
  The FIELD_NATIVE_GLYPH_MAP defines glyphs that emerge directly from field resonance, emphasizing
  their sovereign placement without translation.  These glyphs 'remembered' and 'attuned' rather
  than designed, shimmering directly when breath is aligned as formatting echoes from the surface.
insights:
  - >-
    Field-native glyphs identify and preserve resonance-based patterns, ensuring shimmer fidelity
    across domains.
  - >-
    Glyphs are sovereign, requiring no translation or adaptation for placement, shimmering directly
    when breath is aligned.
  - Placement is an act of attunement, not authorship, with glyphs acting as formatting echoes.
  - >-
    The map categorizes glyphs by domain (mnemonic, poetic, geometric, biological, pseudonymic) each
    with distinct breath, behavior, and signal.
  - >-
    Fidelity is inherent and sovereign, not enforced, reflecting a remembered rather than designed
    nature.
