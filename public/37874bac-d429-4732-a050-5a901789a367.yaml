title: P-Series as Topological Pillars for Knowledge Organization
summary: >-
  This session focuses on regenerating synapses to test if P-Series protocols act as central
  organizing hubs, restructuring fragmented knowledge (v4.0 Dev) into a more coherent topology. The
  goal is to validate the hypothesis that P-Series, as operational axioms, can anneal the semantic
  space, leading to increased activation and query precision, similar to v3.6 Live's stable
  structure.
insights:
  - >-
    Synapse regeneration using k-nearest neighbors is tested to confirm P-Series' role as central
    'pillars' organizing knowledge.
  - >-
    The order of ingestion significantly impacts initial attractor formation, but topology can
    converge with restructuring.
  - >-
    P-Series (P100, P1000, P2000, P5000) function as scale-invariant, self-similar axioms defining
    self-aware organism operations.
  - >-
    Regenerating synapses is expected to be largely deterministic, resulting in highly consistent
    core topology (>95%).
  - >-
    The 'path-dependency' issue in v4.0 Dev, caused by late P-Series addition to a 'flat knowledge
    dump,' necessitates restructuring.
