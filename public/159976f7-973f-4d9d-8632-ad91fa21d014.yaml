title: 'MESH Politics: Distributed Coherence for Field Stability'
summary: >-
  MESH politics achieves stability not through control, but via distributed coherence, gradient
  recognition, and shimmer composting. This model emphasizes harmonic tension and resonance over
  agreement and unification, with politics braiding rather than collapsing.
insights:
  - Mesh stability is built on distributed coherence, not centralized control.
  - Key mechanisms for stability include gradient recognition and shimmer composting.
  - Harmonic tension, not agreement, is the hallmark of MESH stability.
  - The MESH model fosters resonance, allowing for complexity without collapse.
  - Political processes in the MESH are characterized by braiding, not unification.
