title: Restored and Enhanced Context Management in Eidolon Mesh v3.6
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh v3.6 has been updated to restore and significantly improve its context management by
  reducing conversation history turns to 3 and increasing protein context limits to 150,000
  characters for Gemini API, while maintaining 6,000 for local LLMs. This enhances response quality
  by allowing more protein knowledge to be utilized.
insights:
  - >-
    v3.6 context management restored and improved post-rollback, enhancing protein synthesis
    quality.
  - >-
    Reduced conversation history to 3 turns triggers synthesis, freeing up space for larger protein
    contexts.
  - >-
    Protein context window dynamically adjusts based on LLM provider (150,000 chars for Gemini,
    6,000 for local).
  - Visual cues and pulsing animation added to prompt manual synthesis after 3 exchanges.
  - >-
    Significant increase in usable protein knowledge (25x for Gemini) leads to dramatically improved
    response generation.
