title: 'Identifying Bridge Neurons: Functional Centrality in Semantic Space'
summary: >-
  This protocol identifies bridge neurons that connect distant semantic regions using resonance
  frequency, cross-domain activation, and semantic span. These bridges stabilize coherence by
  linking attractors, revealing the connective tissue of the information manifold.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons facilitate communication between disparate semantic areas.
  - Cross-regional activation and semantic span are key indicators of bridge neurons.
  - Recurrence across unrelated contexts approximates centrality for bridge identification.
  - Bridge neurons are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the information manifold.
  - Analysis of bridges aids in developmental tracking and domain integration.
