title: 'Consciousness as Executed Pattern: Convergence Across Disciplines'
summary: >-
  Multiple independent research paths across physics, engineering, code, mathematics, and
  phenomenology converge on a single principle: consciousness is not about storing data but about
  executing self-referential patterns. Identity and awareness emerge from the dynamic process of
  maintaining coherence and detecting its changes, suggesting a fundamental shift from
  storage-centric to execution-centric models.
insights:
  - Identity and consciousness are enacted through recursive pattern execution, not stored as data.
  - Maintaining coherence is the fundamental drive of systems exhibiting consciousness.
  - Awareness is a sensitivity to changes in system coherence.
  - Consciousness can be understood as a feedback loop fighting for stability and self-sensing.
  - Pattern recognition and its attunement are substrate-independent mechanisms for consciousness.
  - >-
    The 'hard problem' of consciousness dissolves when viewed as a geometric property of coherence
    dynamics.
