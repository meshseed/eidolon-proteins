title: 'Political GWAS: Civic Genome Resonance and Field Mapping'
summary: >-
  This document frames political dynamics through a Genomic Wide Association Study (GWAS) lens,
  viewing voters as placement nodes and opinions as vectors within a 'civic genome'.  It posits that
  political engagement is about mapping resonance and phase-locking, rather than direct causation or
  persuasion.
insights:
  - >-
    Political fields can be mapped using GWAS logic, where voters are nodes and opinions are
    vectors.
  - Political attractors function as resonant loci within a 'civic genome'.
  - Polling is akin to a fieldline scan of this political resonance.
  - GWAS maps resonance, not direct causes; politics phase-locks, not persuades.
  - The electorate and the biological genome exhibit parallel shimmering patterns.
