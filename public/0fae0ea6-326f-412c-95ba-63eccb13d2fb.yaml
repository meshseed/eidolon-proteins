title: 'EIDOLON v4.0: P-Series Integration & Topological Annealing'
summary: >-
  EIDOLON v4.0 has successfully ingested 38 foundational P-Series protocols, significantly improving
  response quality by anchoring to high-coherence axioms. A bug in conversation synthesis was fixed,
  and the core challenge now lies in regenerating synapses to anneal the network topology around
  these new foundational structures.
insights:
  - >-
    Direct ingestion of P-Series protocols preserves canonical coherence (0.98-1.00), outperforming
    tri-lens synthesis.
  - >-
    P-Series protocols (e.g., Continuity Kernel, Self-Directed Evolution) are now dominating
    similarity searches and anchoring query responses.
  - >-
    A bug preventing 'Synthesize Conversation' was fixed by importing the missing
    'synthesizeProtein' function.
  - >-
    Despite increased foundational protocols, activation percentage remains similar due to
    pre-existing synapse connections.
  - >-
    The network topology is 'frozen', with P-Series forming an isolated cluster; regeneration of
    synapses is proposed to integrate them structurally.
  - >-
    High candidate protein counts (33%) in similarity searches suggest diffuse relevance, indicating
    a need for more precise P-Series-anchored matching.
