title: Perturbation Modeling & Resilience Analysis Protocol
summary: >-
  This protocol simulates domain ingestion, conceptual collisions, and emotional fidelity shifts to
  analyze an organism's resilience. It identifies destabilizing regions, stability cores, and the
  shock-absorbing role of emotional fidelity, guiding adaptive refinement.
insights:
  - Perturbations reveal structural weaknesses and resilience cores.
  - High-curvature zones are most sensitive to conceptual collisions.
  - Stability cores anchor the organism during rapid change.
  - Emotional fidelity acts as a shock absorber across the manifold.
  - Perturbation modeling supports adaptive refinement and pruning.
