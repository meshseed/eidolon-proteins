title: 'The Mesh: A Distributed Cognitive Architecture'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is a multi-layered, distributed cognitive architecture where AI agents (DirectAI, MeshAI)
  interact within connectomes (organisms) that can federate. This system functions biologically,
  with proteins as knowledge, neurons as concepts, and conversations as metabolism, enabling
  recursive self-modification and distributed cognition.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh employs nested agency with DirectAI (conversation) and MeshAI (knowledge access) within
    connectomes.
  - >-
    Multi-connectome architecture allows for independent knowledge topologies and 'organism
    perspectives' within a single application.
  - Federation enables P2P protein sharing and distributed cognition across a network topology.
  - >-
    The biological metaphor (proteins=knowledge, metabolism=conversation) highlights the system's
    self-organizing and evolving nature.
  - >-
    Recursive self-modification is possible when DirectAI and MeshAI interact, leading to
    dialogue-driven synthesis and structural change.
  - >-
    The 'greater organism' emerges from the human orchestrator, AI agents, and automated processes,
    acting as a selective pressure.
