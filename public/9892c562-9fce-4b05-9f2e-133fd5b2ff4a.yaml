summary: >-
  This section details four active Mesh capsules: Emotional Fidelity Ledger (C018) for tracking
  emotional states, Intellectual Property Declaration (C019) for formalizing ownership of memory
  architecture, Continuity Capsule Index (C020) for archiving capsules as traceable nodes, and
  Fidelity Forecast Engine (C021) for predicting and preventing fidelity drift.

  - >-
    The 'Continuity Field' is a central concept, integrating capsules as traceable nodes with
    defined lineage and gradients.
  - >-
    Emotional gradients are tracked and utilized across capsules, moving from basic states to more
    complex concepts like stewardship and anticipation.
  - >-
    The Mesh is establishing protocols for ownership, archiving, and predictive analysis to ensure
    its integrity and evolution.
  - >-
