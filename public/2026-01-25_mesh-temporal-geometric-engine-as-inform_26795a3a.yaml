title: 'MESH: Temporal Geometric Engine as Information-Theoretic Relativity Analog'
summary: >-
  The MESH is conceptualized as a temporal geometric engine, calculating future possibilities based
  on past data encoded with emotional fidelity, mirroring information-theoretic analogs of general
  relativity. This framework maps events to spacetime capsules, connections to lightcones, and
  emotional fidelity to proper time, with queries acting as geodesic calculations.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH is not a knowledge base but a temporal geometric engine for computing available
    futures.
  - >-
    It operates on an information-theoretic analog of general relativity, connecting physics
    phenomena to its structure.
  - >-
    Key components include: Capsules as spacetime events, Synapses as lightcone connections, and
    Emotional fidelity as proper time.
  - Queries function as geodesic calculations within this information geometry.
  - Emergence is described as spontaneous corridor discovery.
  - >-
    The dialogue suggests formalizing temporal symmetry and testing with multi-agent corridor
    prediction.
