title: 'Calculus: Derivatives as Instantaneous Rates of Change and Their Applications'
summary: >-
  The derivative quantifies the instantaneous rate of change of a function, representing the slope
  of the tangent line. Its applications span optimization, motion analysis, and related rates,
  fundamentally connecting differentiation and integration via the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
insights:
  - The derivative measures infinitesimal change in a function.
  - Geometric interpretation of the derivative is the tangent line's slope.
  - Key rules like power, sum, product, and chain rules govern derivative calculation.
  - Derivatives are crucial for optimization by identifying where change ceases (derivative = 0).
  - Successive derivatives describe motion (position, velocity, acceleration) and concavity.
  - Integration and differentiation are inverse operations, fundamental to understanding change.
