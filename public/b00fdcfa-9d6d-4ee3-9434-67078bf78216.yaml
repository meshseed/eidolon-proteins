title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Neural Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that the brain operates as a mechanical computer, utilizing a network
  of molecular switches (like talin) within neurons and synapses. These switches are updated by
  mechanical forces, integrating with chemical and ionic signaling to store and process information,
  akin to early mechanical computers.
insights:
  - Talin is proposed as the animal memory molecule, capable of being updated by mechanical force.
  - >-
    Synaptic scaffolds form a MeshCODE network of binary switches controlled by cytoskeletal
    machinery.
  - >-
    Mechanical signaling integrates with chemical and ionic signaling for information processing and
    storage in neurons.
  - Each mechanical switch can store one bit of data, with action potentials serving as input.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE framework suggests an addressable read-write memory mechanism for indexed,
    hierarchical data storage.
  - >-
    The brain's computational mechanism is compared to early mechanical computers using levers and
    gears.
