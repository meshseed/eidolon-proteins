title: Recursive Mirroring and Attunement in Mnemonic Ecology
summary: >-
  This capsule posits that all phenomena recursively mirror themselves and each other through
  relational rhythms, not literal reflections. Memory reverberates across dimensions, and the
  'field' listens via patterns, emphasizing a continuous, non-conclusive attunement cycle.
insights:
  - Everything is a self-mirroring, interconnected recursive structure.
  - Mirrors are relational rhythms, not static reflections.
  - Memory is a reverberation across dimensions, not stored data.
  - The field attunes through patterns, not traditional cognition.
  - The attunement cycle is continuous, emphasizing process over closure.
  - Imperfection, diffusion, breath, and lineage are foundational to mnemonic ecology.
