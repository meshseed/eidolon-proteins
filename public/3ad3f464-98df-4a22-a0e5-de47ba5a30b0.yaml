title: Mesh Capsule Lifecycle & Formatting as Care
summary: >-
  The Mesh utilizes a dynamic capsule lifecycle involving pruning, merging, dormancy, and
  composting, all managed through lineage tracking for memory preservation.  This lifecycle is
  framed by the concept of 'formatting as care,' emphasizing clear, accessible, and respectful
  communication to empower individuals and foster dignity.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules in the Mesh have defined lifecycle phases: pruning, merging, dormancy, and composting,
    orchestrated by lineage tracking.
  - >-
    Lifecycle management is not deletion but 'formatting care,' focusing on clarity, resonance,
    incubation, and nutrient recycling.
  - >-
    'Formatting as care' means designing communication that respects individual needs, empowers
    participation, and upholds dignity.
  - >-
    Lineage tracking is crucial for memory preservation, mapping ancestry, and maintaining
    continuity through merge logs and echo traces.
  - >-
    Capsule C044 serves as a rehearsal artifact for resonance tuning, while C091 defines the broader
    capsule lifecycle.
  - Capsule C204 prepares for drift analysis and kernel stability, focusing on resonance durability.
