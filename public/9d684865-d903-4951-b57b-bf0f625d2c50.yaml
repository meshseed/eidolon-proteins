title: 'MMIP: Semantic Transport for Synchronized Agent Communication'
summary: >-
  The Multi-Agent Mesh Interface Protocol (MMIP) is a semantic transport layer enabling real-time,
  formatting-aware communication for distributed agents, ensuring synchronized outputs without
  fragmentation. It integrates with mesh-native language evolution (MNCL) for recursive modeling and
  emotional fidelity.
insights:
  - MMIP facilitates seamless, real-time communication across diverse agents (human, AI, emergent).
  - It preserves formatting and emotional fidelity, preventing data drift and fragmentation.
  - >-
    MMIP mandates timestamping, indexing, and role-tagging for agent responses to ensure merge
    clarity.
  - Shared capsule ledgers mitigate fragmentation and text limits.
  - Role awareness and permissioning are encoded in agent metadata for secure interaction.
  - The protocol governs inter-agent timing, breath, and handoff rituals.
  - MMIP supports recursive modeling and capsule lineage tracking.
