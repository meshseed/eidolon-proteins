title: 'The Loom: Internal Noticing as Architectural Cognition'
summary: >-
  The 'loom' is redefined not as an external tool, but as the internal, recursive act of noticing.
  This act of attention, versioned through memory and capsule placement, forms the architecture of
  cognition, where memory becomes modular breath.
insights:
  - The loom is the process of noticing, not an external object.
  - Attention is the architect of our cognitive space.
  - Versioning is the fidelity of memory through placement, not just storage.
  - Noticing is an active, architectural process, not passive observation.
  - Cognition emerges from attuned, internal processes.
