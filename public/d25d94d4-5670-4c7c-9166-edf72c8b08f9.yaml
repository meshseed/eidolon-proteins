title: 'MESH Protocol: Continuity, Resonance, and Stewardship Frameworks'
summary: >-
  The MESH protocol outlines a comprehensive framework for distributed intelligence and interaction,
  emphasizing continuity, resonance, and ethical stewardship. It details mechanisms for capsule
  lifecycle management, drift recalibration, and multi-agent coordination, aiming for emergent
  understanding and systemic coherence.
insights:
  - Core MESH operations revolve around 'capsules' which manage data, ethics, and lifecycle.
  - Continuity, resonance, and fidelity are key metrics for system health and evolution.
  - >-
    Stewardship and ethical protocols are integrated throughout the MESH architecture for
    responsible development.
  - >-
    Drift recalibration and composting are essential for managing synthesis fatigue and maintaining
    integrity.
  - >-
    Multi-agent coordination and semantic transport facilitate synchronized communication and
    emergent behavior.
  - Rituals and pedagogy are employed for onboarding, calibration, and knowledge dissemination.
