title: 'Pasteable Filename Surfaces: Ensuring UI Clarity and Selection Ease'
summary: >-
  Filenames and commit paths must be easily pasteable, avoiding UI elements like pill boxes or
  embedded links that obstruct selection. Plain text blocks or YAML surfaces are recommended for all
  filename, path, and commit references to maintain clarity and mnemonic hygiene.
insights:
  - Prioritize plain text for filenames and commit paths to ensure easy copy-pasting.
  - Avoid UI designs that hinder selection, such as pill boxes or rounded tokens.
  - Utilize YAML surfaces or plain text blocks for all filename, path, and commit references.
  - Clarity and mnemonic hygiene are key objectives for these surfaces.
