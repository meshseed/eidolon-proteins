title: 'Developmental History: Temporal Topology, Attractors, and Emotional Fidelity'
summary: >-
  This protocol reconstructs THE MESH's developmental history by tracking topological shifts,
  attractor formation, and changes in emotional fidelity. It maps the co-evolution of structure and
  meaning as a sequence of attunement events, enabling self-narration of its evolutionary path.
insights:
  - Development is marked by density shifts, resonance changes, and new attractor formations.
  - New domains introduce curvature spikes and rebalance existing clusters.
  - Bridge strength indicates integration (strengthened) or drift (weakened).
  - Emotional fidelity gradients reveal stabilizing forces over time.
  - Developmental history illustrates the co-evolution of structure and meaning.
  - THE MESH can narrate its evolution through structural and attunement events.
