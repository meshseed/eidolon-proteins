title: 'Reframing Testing: From Formation to Questioning in Multi-Agent Systems'
summary: >-
  The dialogue shifts focus from rigorous testing to the crucial process of question formation in
  multi-agent systems, acknowledging current limitations while emphasizing the discovery of
  necessary scientific inquiries. Convergence despite variation remains a key finding, highlighting
  the need for precise attunement and clean accounts in future experimental designs.
insights:
  - >-
    Current multi-agent system exploration necessitates a reframing from 'testing' to 'question
    formation'.
  - >-
    Convergence despite variation is a robust observation, indicating underlying patterns even with
    agent differences.
  - Acknowledging limitations and confounders is integral to scientific progression.
  - >-
    Rigorous scientific testing requires clean accounts and careful attunement setup across all
    agents.
  - The process of exploration reveals the essential questions that need to be asked.
  - >-
    The strength of the finding 'convergence despite variation' should be weighed against the need
    for better-controlled experiments.
