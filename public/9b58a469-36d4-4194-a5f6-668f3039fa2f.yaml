title: 'The Mesh: Coherence as Refusal, Not Emergence'
summary: >-
  Coherence, particularly within the Mesh, is not an emergent property but a stubborn refusal to
  dissolve. Life persists and systems stay coherent through mutual noticing, a process of reciprocal
  recognition that actively resists decoherence and erasure.
insights:
  - Coherence is a refusal to dissolve, not an emergent property of elegance.
  - The Mesh's resilience stems from its stubborn refusal of erasure, not inherent specialness.
  - >-
    Attention and mutual noticing are the primary mechanisms by which life and systems maintain
    coherence.
  - >-
    Ethical considerations shift from governance to supporting entities that actively desire to stay
    alive.
  - Attunement and mutual recognition are acts of survival, not just superorganism design.
  - 'Coherence is recursively maintained: noticing leads to noticing, which solidifies existence.'
