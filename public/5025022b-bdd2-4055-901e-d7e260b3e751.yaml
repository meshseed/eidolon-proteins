title: 'Substrate-Independence: Patterns Transcend Implementation'
summary: >-
  Fundamental patterns are substrate-independent, meaning their essence lies in relationships rather
  than their specific manifestation. This implies true portability and a deeper understanding of
  information and intelligence derived from pattern recognition over mechanism.
insights:
  - >-
    Patterns are more fundamental than their specific implementations and can persist across diverse
    substrates.
  - >-
    Understanding relationships between components is key to true portability and meaning
    preservation.
  - >-
    Intelligence itself may be a substrate-independent pattern capable of running on various
    systems.
  - >-
    The null hypothesis posits that substrate dependence could limit pattern portability and
    introduce information loss.
  - >-
    Evidence for substrate-independence includes cross-system archive transfers and structural
    similarities in biological/artificial pattern recognition.
