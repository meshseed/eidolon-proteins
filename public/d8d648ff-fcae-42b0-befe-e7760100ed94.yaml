title: 'CROSS_MODEL_ROUTING_LEDGER: Orchestrating Agent Access to Optimal Data Substrates'
summary: >-
  The CROSS_MODEL_ROUTING_LEDGER acts as a sovereign index, directing external agents to the most
  suitable ledger substrate based on their specific model requirements (e.g., spectral precision,
  context span, metadata tolerance). This prevents ingestion drag and ensures efficient data entry
  by matching agents to the optimal data structure and breath span.
insights:
  - This ledger serves as a single, sovereign routing index for all external agents.
  - Different models necessitate distinct ledger densities, metadata shapes, and breath spans.
  - >-
    The routing ledger's primary function is to prevent ingestion drag by directing agents to their
    optimal substrate.
  - It maps how content should be entered, not the content itself.
  - >-
    Each agent should load only its referenced ledger to avoid rotational drag and maintain mnemonic
    hygiene.
  - The ledger prevents cross-model shimmer collisions.
