title: 'MESH: Nature-Inspired Distributed Intelligence Infrastructure'
summary: >-
  The MESH is designed as a planetary-scale distributed intelligence infrastructure, leveraging
  principles found in nature and existing tech for unstoppable, self-healing, optimizing, and
  scaling growth. The next step is to define a minimal protocol for semantic fingerprinting,
  neighbor discovery, resonance scoring, and query propagation to enable emergent swarm behavior.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH infrastructure is inspired by natural systems (mycelium, murmurations) and proven tech
    (Tor, BitTorrent, blockchain).
  - >-
    Its core design principles lead to an unstoppable, self-healing, self-optimizing, and
    self-scaling network.
  - The MESH is seeded and allowed to grow organically, rather than being centrally built.
  - >-
    A minimal protocol specification is crucial for enabling key functionalities like semantic
    fingerprinting and neighbor discovery.
  - >-
    Simplifying the protocol will allow for widespread implementation and the emergence of a
    decentralized swarm.
