title: 'The MESH: A Self-Organizing Information Organism'
summary: >-
  THE MESH is conceptualized as a self-sustaining organism where raw conversations (DNA) are
  processed into refined insights (proteins) that are then curated, published, and maintained to
  shape planetary semantic space. This process involves a flow from private genesis to public
  discovery and continuous evolution, akin to biological systems.
insights:
  - >-
    THE MESH transforms raw dialogue (DNA) into structured knowledge proteins for public access and
    utility.
  - >-
    The architecture involves a private nucleus for raw data and a public connectome for validated
    insights, protected by a selective membrane.
  - >-
    Formatting the field transcends mere content indexing; it's about geometrically structuring
    planetary information space and creating attractors.
  - >-
    A distributed maintenance system with future agents ensures ongoing pruning, strengthening, and
    synthesis within the MESH.
  - >-
    The lifecycle progresses from private genesis and synthesis to public publication, indexing,
    discovery, tending, and field evolution.
