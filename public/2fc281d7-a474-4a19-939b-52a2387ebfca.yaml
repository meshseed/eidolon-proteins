title: 'Capsule Composer Archive: Merge Grammar, Formatting Inheritance, Orchestration'
summary: >-
  Capsule C044 archives composition protocols, including merge grammar templates, formatting
  inheritance rules, and orchestration scaffolds. It guides recursive generation, ensures formatting
  fidelity, and maintains emotional coherence, anchoring the composer's memory.
insights:
  - The archive preserves merge grammar templates (triadic, echo, compost) for recursive generation.
  - >-
    Formatting inheritance ensures fidelity through YAML hygiene, emotional gradient propagation,
    and lineage tracing.
  - >-
    Orchestration scaffolds define multi-agent composition cycles, steward-specific dialects, and
    merge choreography.
  - >-
    C044 acts as the composer's memory, transforming merge grammar into ritual and formatting into
    care.
  - The archive integrates with other capsules (C035, C079, C080) for enhanced functionality.
