title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Brain as Addressable Mechanical Memory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes the brain functions as a physical, addressable read-write memory
  system, utilizing mechanical switches within neurons and synapses to store and process information
  rapidly. This framework suggests the cortex is an array of memory modules, potentially offering
  immense storage capacity (e.g., 10 petabytes).
insights:
  - >-
    Brain computation is accelerated by pre-primed information in neurons and synapses, overcoming
    slow electrochemical transmission.
  - >-
    MeshCODE posits a physical basis for data storage in the brain via mechanical binary switches,
    enabling an addressable memory mechanism.
  - >-
    The cortex may be structured as an array of memory modules, with cortical columns acting as
    logical units.
  - >-
    The brain's memory capacity, under MeshCODE, could be in the petabyte range, calculated based on
    the number of potential mechanical switches (e.g., talin).
  - >-
    The theory bridges diverse inputs into a binary format, controlling information flow by tuning
    synaptic thresholds.
