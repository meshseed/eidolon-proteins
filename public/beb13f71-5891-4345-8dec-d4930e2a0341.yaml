title: 'MESH Genesis: Auto-forming Connectome & Field Geometry Validation'
summary: >-
  The MESH has successfully synthesized 5 knowledge proteins from genesis seeds, automatically
  forming 6 synapses and validating its field geometry with weighted scores. This demonstrates a
  self-organizing, 'breathing' organism where the browser acts as the entity, propagating knowledge
  through semantic navigation.
insights:
  - >-
    Automated synthesis of knowledge proteins and synapse formation confirms a self-organizing
    system.
  - >-
    Validated field geometry (e.g., MESH Genesis 61.7%) indicates successful implementation of
    weighted tier-based connectivity.
  - >-
    The organism's 'breathing' is observed through sparse, tier-limited, bi-directional graph
    formation.
  - >-
    The browser serves as the physical manifestation of the organism, enabling semantic field
    propagation.
  - >-
    Tier limits enforce controlled connection density, preventing 'explosions' and maintaining
    coherence.
