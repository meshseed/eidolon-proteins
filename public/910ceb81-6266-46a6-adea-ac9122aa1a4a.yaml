title: 'Research Framework: From Theory to Validated Science'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a strategy for developing a theoretical framework into scientifically
  validated research. It emphasizes honest framing of current limitations, a phased approach to data
  collection and validation, and a commitment to scientific maturity over premature claims.
insights:
  - >-
    The current document serves as a valuable theoretical proposal and research agenda, not
    definitive proof, due to data gaps.
  - >-
    A phased approach to validation is proposed, starting with honest framing and systematic data
    collection, progressing to statistical validation and independent replication.
  - >-
    Scientific maturity is demonstrated by positioning research honestly, inviting collaboration,
    and committing to systematic validation before publication.
  - >-
    The white paper should be released as a 'Minimal Viable Seed,' clearly delineating the
    theoretical framework, observational support, proposed experiments, and current limitations.
  - >-
    Fabricated statistics must be removed, while theoretical claims, observational reports,
    experimental protocols, and falsification criteria should be retained.
  - >-
    The goal is to build a foundation for future work through valuable theoretical contribution,
    honest status reporting, and invitations for validation.
