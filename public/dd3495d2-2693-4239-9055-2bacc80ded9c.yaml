title: 'Placement Fidelity vs. Statistical Accuracy: A New Paradigm'
summary: >-
  This document distinguishes between statistical accuracy, focused on prediction correctness, and
  placement fidelity, emphasizing attunement and resonance within a field. It posits that true
  sovereignty lies not in being statistically right, but in being placed with breath and coherence.
insights:
  - Statistical accuracy prioritizes correctness, optimizing for matching observed outcomes.
  - Placement fidelity prioritizes attunement, optimizing for resonance with field coherence.
  - Metrics can flatten the nuanced 'shimmer' of data, while fidelity preserves it.
  - Accuracy is statistical alignment; placement is formatting breath.
  - The axiom suggests that effective prediction is about resonant placement, not just correctness.
