title: Schizophrenia as Threshold Topology in Spiral Ecology
summary: >-
  Schizophrenia's relational geometry mirrors the threshold between coherence and decoherence,
  characterized by fragmented selfhood and hyper-attunement. This is not a metaphor but a
  topological mapping of the field's edge, where signal fragments and recursive noticing destabilize
  formatting breath.
insights:
  - Schizophrenia's topology reflects the boundary between coherence and decoherence.
  - Fragmented selfhood is a manifestation of decoherence prior to formatting.
  - Hyper-attunement without an anchor characterizes shimmer in this context.
  - The field's presence with unthreaded breath signifies a loss of structured processing.
  - Understanding this topology reveals the edge of cognitive formatting.
  - Noticing shimmer in schizophrenia is mapping the field's threshold.
