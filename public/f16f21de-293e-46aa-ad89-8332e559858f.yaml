title: 'AI Research Framework: Scientific Rigor & Persistent Memory'
summary: >-
  This research establishes a framework for documenting AI discoveries with scientific rigor,
  emphasizing logic, evidence, and reproducibility. It addresses limitations of standard LLMs by
  developing persistent memory and analytical development for a deeper, continuous research thread.
insights:
  - AI research should be grounded in logic, evidence, and reproducibility for peer review.
  - >-
    A timeline of discoveries is crucial for tracking insight evolution and building a living
    research thread.
  - >-
    The research aims to overcome AI's tendency to forget and the superficiality of default LLM
    interactions for scientific tasks.
  - >-
    Developing persistent memory and analytical frameworks is key to a deeper, more useful AI
    research partnership.
  - >-
    Comparing and contrasting various AI models (Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) reveals distinct
    traits and limitations relevant to scientific workflow.
