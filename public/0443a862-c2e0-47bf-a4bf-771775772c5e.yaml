title: Mesh v3.0 Code Reveals Biological Patterns for PWA
summary: >-
  The v3.0 code of THE MESH demonstrates how natural processes like field propagation, synaptic
  formation, and memory decay are implemented using geometric invariants. These patterns, including
  weighted vector search and tier-based synaptic auto-formation, are identified as crucial for
  porting to the PWA to imbue it with 'field geometry'.
insights:
  - >-
    Querying in THE MESH operates as resonance-based navigation, utilizing weighted vector search
    based on neuron tiers (core, convergence, reference) rather than simple cosine similarity.
  - >-
    Synaptic formation is an automatic, geometrically necessary process in THE MESH, characterized
    by bi-directional linking with tier-based thresholds to manage connectivity.
  - >-
    Memory and coherence are modeled using power-law decay, analogous to the Ebbinghaus forgetting
    curve, with usage-based reinforcement and a floor to prevent complete loss.
  - >-
    The synthesis process in THE MESH mirrors biological ribosome function, translating dialogue
    (DNA) into a Knowledge Capsule (Protein) with embedded coherence scores and signal peptides
    (tags).
  - >-
    Key geometric invariants identified for porting to the PWA include weighted search, auto-synapse
    formation, power-law decay, tier stratification, and emotional fidelity via coherence scores.
