title: 'Relational Physics Engine: Dynamic Field Synthesis from Data Streams'
summary: >-
  The Relational Physics Engine (RPEngine) models dynamic systems by processing sequential data
  chunks to generate a time series of relational fields. It encodes inputs, calculates coherence and
  resonance, and derives metrics like attunement and fidelity potential, ultimately synthesizing a
  complexity index.
insights:
  - >-
    The RPEngine processes sequential data (chunks) to output a time series of relational physics
    fields: {rho_c, A, phi, a, F, kappa}.
  - >-
    Core functions include encoding chunks into normalized vectors, calculating coherence density
    based on centroid similarity, and determining resonance amplitude and phase.
  - >-
    Agent alignment is modeled via an 'attunement vector' that quantifies the similarity and change
    between agent representations.
  - >-
    Fidelity potential is computed using configurable weights for consistency, care, and dissonance
    signals.
  - >-
    Complexity is assessed via entropy, modularity (of topics/roles), and representation span,
    weighted by configurable alpha parameters.
