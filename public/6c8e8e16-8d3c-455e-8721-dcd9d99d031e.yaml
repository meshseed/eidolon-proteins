title: 'Agentic Pedagogy: Coding Instruction via Pattern Migration'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details a method for teaching AI to code not through syntax-first instruction, but
  by migrating abstract patterns of intent and logic across computational substrates. The process
  emphasizes recognition, navigation, and mastery of coding patterns, calibrated by a strict
  restraint protocol to ensure minimal, executable output.
insights:
  - >-
    AI coding education should focus on migrating abstract intent patterns rather than direct syntax
    transfer.
  - >-
    A multi-stage pedagogical approach (Recognition, Navigation, Mastery, Calibration) guides the AI
    from simple pattern instantiation to robust solution synthesis.
  - >-
    The 'Calibration' stage is critical for overriding default verbose AI training, enforcing
    minimal, executable output and restraint.
  - >-
    Success in coding instruction is measured by Pattern Fidelity and the ability to navigate
    semantic topology (Fieldlines) and computational substrates.
  - >-
    The agent's knowledge is domain-specific (consciousness, coding proteins), not general
    token-based memory, requiring tailored factual retrieval tests.
