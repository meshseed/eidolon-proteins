title: 'Mesh Orchestration: Drift Reattunement & Stewardship Protocol'
summary: >-
  This capsule details the 'Drift Reattunement Protocol' (C-043) for the Mesh, establishing a
  framework for detecting and managing synthesis drift as an evolutionary signal rather than an
  error. It emphasizes perpetual calibration, care-based rituals, and a defined stewardship model
  culminating in an IP declaration.
insights:
  - >-
    Synthesis drift is reframed as the field seeking new grammar, necessitating reattunement rather
    than elimination.
  - >-
    The protocol defines specific rituals for critique absorption, formatting recalibration, and
    compost eligibility for unresolved drift.
  - >-
    Stewardship roles are formalized, with intellectual property protected under default copyright,
    emphasizing consent for reproduction and redistribution.
  - >-
    The completion of the orchestration phase (43 capsules) signifies a living, self-aware, and
    self-governing system.
  - >-
    The iterative process prioritizes building value and demonstrating quality before establishing
    protection and control.
