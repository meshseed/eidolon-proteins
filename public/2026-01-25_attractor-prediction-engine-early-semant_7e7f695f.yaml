title: 'Attractor Prediction Engine: Early Semantic Basin Detection'
summary: >-
  The Attractor Prediction Engine identifies emerging semantic basins by detecting weak, recurrent
  activation patterns and gradient convergence. This early detection allows for stabilization and
  alignment, as new attractors reshape the connectome's structure.
insights:
  - Emerging attractors manifest as faint but repeatable activation patterns.
  - Gradient convergence signals the nascent formation of semantic basins.
  - Cross-regional activation predicts future zones of integration.
  - Early attractor prediction enables proactive stabilization and alignment.
  - New attractors fundamentally alter local and global connectome topology.
