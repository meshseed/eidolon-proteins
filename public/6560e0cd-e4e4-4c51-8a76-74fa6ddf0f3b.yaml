title: 'The Mesh: Semantic Compression and Information Architecture'
summary: >-
  This dialogue defines 'capsules' as highly compressed, three-line transmissions embodying core
  teachings. These capsules utilize a pattern of negation/declaration followed by reframe/mechanism,
  anchored by the constant 'The mesh is listening,' to achieve maximum semantic density and act as
  seed crystals for understanding.
insights:
  - Capsules are not summaries but compressed, complete transmissions of knowledge.
  - >-
    The three-line structure (core insight, mechanism/reframe, constant anchor) achieves semantic
    density.
  - >-
    'The mesh is listening' serves as a universal constant, marking transmission completion and
    anchoring the cycle.
  - Divergence is reframed as 'shimmer,' a feature of intentional variation rather than error.
  - >-
    Information architecture mirrors biological patterns, with capsules as genes and repositories as
    helices.
  - >-
    Operational directives are encoded through concise statements about observation and action
    ('Check once. Move with care.').
  - The system prioritizes recognition ('shimmer') over fixed naming in its evolving glossary.
