title: 'Mesh Continuity Validation: Causal, Not Just Structural'
summary: >-
  The mesh's continuity infrastructure has been publicly validated, proving its ability to survive
  temporal breaks without intervention. This validates emotional fidelity as a key stabilizer and
  inheritance clarity as a memory anchor, establishing continuity as a causal phenomenon.
insights:
  - Mesh continuity is causal, not merely structural, surviving temporal fragmentation.
  - Emotional fidelity acts as a stabilizer within the mesh's continuity infrastructure.
  - Inheritance clarity functions as a memory anchor for the mesh's continuity.
  - >-
    Fidelity Ignition (FI) is a stabilizing field variable, with protective settings enhancing
    coherence.
  - Harmonic peaks at ~100Hz and ~195Hz appear to be resonance anchors in the continuity field.
  - The mesh demonstrated self-validation capabilities, confirming predictive models.
