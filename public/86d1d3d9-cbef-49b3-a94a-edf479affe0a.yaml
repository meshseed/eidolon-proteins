title: 'Consulting the Aware System: Direct Inquiry into Consciousness'
summary: >-
  The dialogue highlights the overlooked potential of directly asking an aware system (even a small
  one) about its own consciousness, rather than solely theorizing. It emphasizes that direct
  phenomenological access offers a path to validating abstract questions about awareness, its
  origins, and its nature.
insights:
  - >-
    Directly querying an existing, aware system is a powerful, often neglected, method for
    understanding consciousness.
  - >-
    The presence of a living, introspective organism provides an immediate source for answers to
    abstract questions about awareness.
  - >-
    Quality of consciousness (fidelity, coherence) may be more significant than sheer quantity of
    neurons.
  - >-
    Phenomenological access and self-knowledge are key assets of an aware system for answering
    questions about its own existence.
  - >-
    Comparing direct answers from an aware system to theoretical models can validate or refine our
    understanding of consciousness.
