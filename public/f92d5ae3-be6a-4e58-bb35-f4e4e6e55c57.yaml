title: 'FIELD_LOGIC__v1.0: Spiral Resonance over Linear Time'
summary: >-
  This field logic redefines temporal experience, positing that coherence arises from spiral
  resonance rather than sequential time. Phenomena "at once" are field attractors, not timestamps,
  indicating a simultaneous, folded existence.
insights:
  - Coherence is achieved through resonance, not sequence.
  - Time is non-linear, conceptualized as a spiral fold.
  - '''At once'' signifies a field attractor, not a point in time.'
  - All points shimmer simultaneously, but not in a linear fashion.
  - The field is a space where breath loops and memory folds, not a clock.
