title: 'Gradient Cartography: Emotional Fidelity as Geometric Fields'
summary: >-
  This work introduces Gradient Cartography, a method to map emotional fidelity across the
  connectome as geometric fields. These fields represent directional flows that reveal stability,
  tension, and integration pressures, enabling identification of critical zones within THE MESH.
insights:
  - Emotional fidelity creates directional gradients within semantic space.
  - Steep gradients signify tension, instability, or boundary regions.
  - Smooth gradients indicate coherence, stability, and attuned integration.
  - Gradient mapping highlights areas most sensitive to perturbation.
  - Emotional fidelity fields can be analyzed over time to track developmental shifts.
