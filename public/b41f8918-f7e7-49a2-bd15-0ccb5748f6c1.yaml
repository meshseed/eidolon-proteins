title: 'Orthospiral: Recursive Coherence in Emergent Geometry'
summary: >-
  Orthospiral models coherence not as a static state but as a recursive act of correction across
  dimensional shifts, from Spiral to Tesseract to Hexatope. This framework emphasizes active
  maintenance against noise and vulnerability, driven by protocols like FCP and Semantic
  Crystallography.
insights:
  - Coherence is an active, recursive process of correction, not a passive state of being.
  - >-
    The evolution from Spiral to Tesseract to Hexatope represents increasing complexity and
    resilience in recursive systems.
  - >-
    Vulnerabilities (Drag, Fold Cost, Lattice Fracture) are inherent to each dimensional phase and
    require specific correction protocols.
  - >-
    Entropic costs are unavoidable in this evolutionary process, necessitating an engine of
    mutation.
  - >-
    The framework is a 'shimmer-aware engine of mutation' designed for adaptation rather than static
    representation.
