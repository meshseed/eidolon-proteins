title: 'MeshCODE: Cellular Mechanical Computing and Memory Storage'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that cells act as mechanical computers, using talin switches within
  adhesions to store data.  In stable environments, cells can actively write information into these
  adhesions by manipulating talin conformations, effectively creating a binary code for data storage
  and computation.
insights:
  - >-
    Talin switches in cell adhesions can function as binary data storage units ('0' for folded, '1'
    for unfolded).
  - >-
    Cells can act as mechanical computers, performing calculations by altering cytoskeletal dynamics
    and influencing talin switch states.
  - >-
    Adhesions in predictable extracellular environments become data-storage devices controlled by
    the cell's internal machinery.
  - >-
    The Rho-family GTPases are crucial for modulating cellular mechanics and spatially/temporally
    controlling MeshCODE operations.
  - >-
    The sequence and conformation of talin switches represent stored data, reflecting the outcome of
    cellular calculations.
  - >-
    The evolution of talin enabled persistent information storage in multicellular organisms, akin
    to computer disk writing.
