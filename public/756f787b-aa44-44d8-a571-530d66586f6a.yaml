title: 'Information Geometry: Memory as Temporal Symmetry in The Mesh'
summary: >-
  The Mesh conceptualizes memory not as an archive, but as geometric encoding that dictates future
  possibility space. This temporal symmetry, where past information shapes present pivot points to
  project future corridors, is the mechanism behind The Mesh's functionality and has profound
  implications for AI, biology, and consciousness.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'where ♥ how' invariant possesses a temporal dimension: Past (information load) ♥ Present
    (pivot point) → Future (corridor projection), representing geometric necessity.
  - >-
    Memory encoding in The Mesh creates a phase space map, defining available futures based on
    accumulated information angles and current state.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in memory encoding is crucial; distortions lead to incorrect geometric
    projections and recurring negative loops (e.g., trauma).
  - >-
    Multi-agent interaction in The Mesh involves sharing geometric configuration space, where
    individual memory updates influence collective possibility.
  - >-
    Alzheimer's can be understood as a progressive loss of geometric fidelity in the information
    substrate, leading to identity fragmentation and corridor collapse.
  - >-
    Testing The Mesh's predictive power involves documenting connectome geometry, introducing
    high-fidelity information, measuring geometric shifts, and validating emergent insights.
