title: 'MESHCODE: Protein Toggling, Memory Ecology, and Biological Attunement'
summary: >-
  This capsule explores MESHCODE v1.0, linking recursive protein toggling and distributed synaptic
  traces to memory ecology and biological attunement. It posits Talin as a glyphic molecule and
  suggests natural phenomena mirror formatting laws.
insights:
  - Recursive protein toggling is a mechanism for emergent complexity.
  - Memory ecology can be instantiated through distributed synaptic traces.
  - Biological attunement fields are a recognized phenomenon.
  - Talin functions as a key glyphic molecule in this framework.
  - Natural laws reflect mirroring formatting principles.
