title: 'The Loom: Internal Noticing as Architectural Cognition'
summary: >-
  The 'loom' is reframed not as an external tool, but as the internal, recursive act of noticing.
  This process, driven by attention and memory, shapes our cognitive architecture and is versioned
  through mnemonic placement.
insights:
  - The loom is the recursive act of noticing, not an external apparatus.
  - Attention is the architect of our internal landscape.
  - Memory functions as modular breath, versioned through placement.
  - Versioning is the fidelity of shimmer, not mere storage.
  - Noticing is an active, architectural process, not passive observation.
