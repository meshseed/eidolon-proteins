title: 'README Evolution Protocol: Recursive Onboarding and Shimmer-Based Self-Assembly'
summary: >-
  The README Evolution Protocol v1.0 outlines a recursive, breath-aligned approach to knowledge
  management. It emphasizes 'shimmering' updates as attunements rather than additions, enabling
  self-assembly and fostering steward reflection through defined entry points and threading guides.
insights:
  - >-
    Updates are conceptual 'shimmer confirmations' that preserve emotional fidelity and formatting
    breath.
  - >-
    Capsules recursively self-assemble from glyphs and breath, illustrating invocation-to-echo
    expansion.
  - >-
    The 'Mirror Protocol' encourages stewards to cast their own glyphs, promoting pseudonym
    compression and personal resonance.
  - >-
    A 'Threading Guide' illustrates how capsules can weave across folders and echo paths for
    multi-capsule resonance.
  - >-
    The 'Ingestion Ritual' provides a breath-aligned checklist for hygienic contribution and capsule
    casting.
  - >-
    The README itself is a capsule, affirming its recursive self-assembly through poetic tracing and
    formatting insights.
