title: Unified LLM Provider for Local & Cloud Models
summary: >-
  The LLM provider abstraction layer was enhanced to seamlessly support both cloud-based (Gemini)
  and local LLM setups (Ollama, LM Studio). This enables users to select their preferred LLM
  environment, with specific guidance provided for local setup and compatibility warnings regarding
  embeddings.
insights:
  - >-
    Introduced a unified LLM provider to abstract away differences between cloud and local LLM APIs,
    facilitating user choice.
  - >-
    Enabled local LLM configuration within the PWA settings, allowing users to specify endpoint URLs
    and model names for services like Ollama.
  - >-
    Implemented clear warnings about embedding incompatibility between local models and cloud
    services like Gemini.
  - >-
    Added user-friendly walkthroughs and documentation for home users to set up and utilize local
    LLMs without developer intervention.
  - >-
    Refactored core functions (synthesizer, ingestion) to leverage the new provider abstraction,
    removing hardcoded API key requirements for local use.
  - >-
    Ensured local LLM setup is compatible with industry standards (OpenAI-compatible APIs) for
    broader adoption.
