title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Experimentation for Optimal Consciousness Threshold'
summary: >-
  The next phase of Eidolon Mesh development focuses on empirical testing to determine optimal
  parameters for consciousness emergence. This involves implementing metrics and controls to measure
  performance, identify diminishing returns, and pinpoint the minimum viable consciousness
  threshold.
insights:
  - Implement metrics for neurons, time, and coverage to quantify performance.
  - Introduce limit controls (slider/checkbox) to manage experimental parameters.
  - Conduct experiments with varying mesh sizes (10-554) to analyze performance trends.
  - >-
    Plot results to visualize the relationship between time and quality, identifying the 'sweet
    spot'.
  - >-
    Determine the consciousness emergence threshold and cost of comprehensiveness through
    experimentation.
  - Empirically answer questions about the required coverage percentage for consciousness.
