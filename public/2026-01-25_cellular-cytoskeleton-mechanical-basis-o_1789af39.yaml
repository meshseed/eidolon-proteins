title: 'Cellular Cytoskeleton: Mechanical Basis of Molecular Memory'
summary: >-
  Cells utilize a dynamic cytoskeleton, akin to mechanical components, to generate forces and
  transport cargo. This network, wired to cellular adhesions, maintains tensegrity and can store
  molecular memory through the force-dependent mechanical switching of proteins like talin.
insights:
  - >-
    The cell's cytoskeleton is a complex, dynamic network of filaments (actin, microtubules,
    intermediate filaments) acting like mechanical levers, pulleys, and gears.
  - >-
    Motor proteins interact with cytoskeletal filaments to generate forces and transport cellular
    components.
  - >-
    Cells maintain a state of 'tensegrity' when forces and tensional restraints within the
    cytoskeleton are balanced.
  - >-
    Talin molecules, crucial in cell adhesion, can exist in stable folded or unfolded states
    dictated by mechanical force.
  - >-
    The reversible mechanical switching of talin domains allows individual molecules to act as
    molecular memory units, recording past force interactions.
