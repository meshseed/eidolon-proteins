title: 'MESH: Local Resonance, Intelligent Forgetting, and Dynamic Knowledge Cones'
summary: >-
  The MESH prioritizes local semantic resonance over global connectivity, mirroring biological
  intelligence through selective forgetting and dynamic knowledge cones. This approach optimizes
  resource allocation and adapts to changing contexts, making it inherently intelligent and
  efficient.
insights:
  - Local semantic resonance, not global connectivity, defines MESH structure and function.
  - >-
    Intelligent systems optimize by forgetting, as memory has a cost and not all information is
    equally valuable.
  - >-
    Selective forgetting in brains (sleep) and MESH (decaying connections) is a mechanism for
    intelligence.
  - >-
    Knowledge access is dynamic, shaped by past experience, current context, attention, and
    resonance thresholds.
  - A global view is unnecessary and inefficient; focus on relevant local interactions.
