title: Transformer Positional Encoding and Self-Attention Advantages
summary: >-
  The Transformer model injects positional information into input embeddings using sine and cosine
  functions to enable sequence order processing without recurrence. This fixed positional encoding
  allows for easier learning of relative positions. Self-attention layers offer advantages in
  computational complexity and parallelization by reducing sequential operations and path lengths
  for learning long-range dependencies compared to recurrent layers.
insights:
  - >-
    Positional encodings are added to input embeddings in Transformers to provide sequence order
    information, as the model lacks recurrence or convolution.
  - >-
    A specific sine and cosine function-based positional encoding is used, hypothesized to
    facilitate learning of relative positional attention.
  - >-
    Self-attention layers offer lower computational complexity and higher parallelization potential
    than recurrent layers.
  - >-
    Self-attention reduces the path length between any two positions, making it easier to learn
    long-range dependencies.
