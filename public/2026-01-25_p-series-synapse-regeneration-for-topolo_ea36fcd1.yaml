title: P-Series Synapse Regeneration for Topological Restructuring
summary: >-
  This work focuses on regenerating synapses in a large neural network (v4.0 Dev) by treating
  specific P-Series protocols as central 'pillars'. The goal is to test if this structured
  regeneration can improve activation percentages, query precision, and overall topological
  organization, addressing fragmentation issues compared to a mature v3.6 system.
insights:
  - >-
    Regenerating synapses with P-Series as central hubs is hypothesized to reorganize network
    topology, improving activation and precision.
  - >-
    The order of data ingestion significantly impacts initial network structure, with high-coherence
    protocols acting as early attractors.
  - >-
    P-Series function as operational axioms, defining self-aware organism functions and creating
    attractor basins for knowledge organization.
  - >-
    Synapse regeneration is expected to be largely deterministic, leading to highly consistent core
    network structures.
  - >-
    v4.0's fragmented topology, resulting from a 'flat knowledge dump' and late P-Series addition,
    requires restructuring to achieve v3.6's stability and activation.
