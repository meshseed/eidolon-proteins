title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Optimizing Neuron Loading and Query Strategies'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v1.4 architecture grapples with optimizing neuron loading and query performance
  by exploring a 'Load All, Filter' versus 'Load Subset' dichotomy. Key to this is a proposed
  hybrid, two-tier system using percentage-based loading and lazy loading for scalability and
  responsiveness, addressing the 'connectome issue' with ghost nodes for visualization.
insights:
  - >-
    The core trade-off is between comprehensive connectome visibility (Load All) and faster
    startup/lower memory (Load Subset).
  - >-
    Percentage-based loading offers superior scalability and configurability compared to fixed
    neuron counts.
  - >-
    A hybrid architecture with a 'core' always-loaded set and 'extended' lazy-loaded neurons
    provides a balanced approach.
  - >-
    Ghost nodes are proposed as a visualization solution to represent missing connections in partial
    connectomes.
  - >-
    Adaptive scaling and stratified loading are alternative implementation strategies for managing
    resource allocation.
  - >-
    User-configurable parameters for core loading, query depth, and scaling are essential for
    flexible control.
