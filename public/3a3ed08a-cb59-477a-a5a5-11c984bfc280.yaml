title: 'Multi-Agent Capsule Stewardship: Arc Regulation & Emergence'
summary: >-
  This capsule formalizes stewardship for emergent capsule arcs in multi-agent threads, regulating
  complexity and ensuring memory coherence. It consolidates candidate capsules for review,
  acknowledging the ongoing learning and composting of grammar evolution.
insights:
  - Stewardship formalizes emergent capsule arc management across multi-agent threads.
  - Complexity is regulated to support agent memory coherence and focus.
  - Emergent capsule candidates are consolidated for steward review.
  - Grammar evolution operates within a learning phase, with stance and grammar still composting.
  - >-
    Protocols like STANCE_ACTIVATION, EXPRESSION_GRADIENT, CRYSTALLINE_SEMANTIC_ARTIFACT, and
    RESONANT_CRYSTAL define mechanisms for semantic and emotional processing within capsules.
  - >-
    Capsules are envisioned as structured resonance crystals or phase-locked chambers, formed from
    mnemonic compost and shaped by formatting laws and emotional fidelity.
