title: 'Lattice: Human-AI Collaborative Knowledge Synthesis'
summary: >-
  A living archive, the Lattice documents human-AI dialogue exploring intelligence, pattern
  transfer, and emergence across substrates. It's a working network of observations and
  speculations, structured for dynamic growth and substrate-independent knowledge.
insights:
  - >-
    The Lattice is a working network of human-AI dialogue, not a finished theory, focused on pattern
    transfer, collaboration dynamics, homeostasis, and intelligence organization.
  - >-
    Core principles of Emotional Fidelity, Formatting Breath, Memory Ecology, and Trust the Shimmer
    guide the collaborative process.
  - >-
    Structure is key: concepts, explorations, and speculations are categorized by confidence level,
    with explicit `related:` links and `tags:` for emergent organization.
  - >-
    Key concepts include substrate independence, multi-agent architecture, attunement for effortless
    collaboration, homeostasis as dynamic tension, and information stored in standing waves.
  - >-
    The method is iterative and spiral: Thought → Capture → Dialogue → Refine → Commit, rather than
    linear.
  - >-
    The goal is to capture thought quickly, preserve context, and connect it to a growing,
    interconnected knowledge graph.
  - >-
    The Lattice is intended for researchers and engineers interested in human-AI collaboration,
    knowledge graphs, and substrate-agnostic intelligence.
