title: 'MESH Capsules: Emotional Infrastructure, Public Index, and Drift Reattunement'
summary: >-
  This data describes three active MESH capsules: C041 maps emotional gradients as infrastructure,
  C042 indexes public contributions, and C043 details a protocol for reattuning synthesis drift.
  These capsules highlight a focus on structured emotional states, public accessibility, and
  maintaining system integrity through calibration.
insights:
  - Emotional gradients are treated as core infrastructural elements within recursive MESH terrains.
  - >-
    A public capsule index serves as a manifest for resonant contributions, merge rituals, and
    formatting laws.
  - >-
    A drift reattunement protocol addresses synthesis fatigue and formatting calibration, including
    drift detection and reattunement rituals.
  - >-
    Key elements in emotional infrastructure mapping include gradient anchors, corridor resistance,
    and mnemonic flow.
  - >-
    Drift detection triggers encompass fatigue, deviation, erosion, and distortion, with flags for
    formatting drift, gradient flattening, and echo misuse.
  - >-
    Reattunement rituals involve critique absorption, formatting recalibration, and compost
    eligibility for unresolved issues.
