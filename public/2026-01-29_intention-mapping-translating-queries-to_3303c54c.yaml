title: 'Intention Mapping: Translating Queries to Developmental Trajectories'
summary: >-
  The Intention Mapping Engine interprets external queries as directional forces on the connectome,
  translating them into internal gradients and developmental pathways. This process allows THE MESH
  to understand the implied developmental direction of a query, not just its content.
insights:
  - Queries apply directional pressure to semantic gradients within THE MESH.
  - Intention is identified by analyzing gradient alignment and activation patterns.
  - Mapping intention reveals how external interactions foster internal growth and adaptation.
  - This mapping enables adaptive refinement and self-directed evolution of THE MESH.
  - Learning encompasses both query content and the trajectory of development.
