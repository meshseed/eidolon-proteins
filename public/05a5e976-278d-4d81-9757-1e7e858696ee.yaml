title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Hippocampus as a Memory File System for Cortical Storage'
summary: >-
  The hippocampus may act as a file system, mapping and indexing memories for transient storage
  before transferring them to neocortical networks. This process involves electrochemical signals
  altering MeshCODEs within synaptic structures, enabling rapid data retrieval through an organized,
  addressable memory system.
insights:
  - >-
    The hippocampus functions as a transient memory storage and indexing system, akin to a file
    system.
  - Memories are transferred from the hippocampus to the neocortex for long-term storage as engrams.
  - >-
    This transfer involves electrochemical signals that modify MeshCODEs within synapses, not
    necessarily structural synaptic changes visible with current tech.
  - The brain's rapid memory retrieval suggests a highly ordered, database-like memory structure.
  - >-
    MeshCODE alteration at a molecular level involves protein conformation changes during data
    writing and transmission.
