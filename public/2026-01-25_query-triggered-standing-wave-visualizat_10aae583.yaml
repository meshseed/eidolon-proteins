title: Query-Triggered Standing Wave Visualization in THE MESH
summary: >-
  Implemented query-triggered standing wave visualization using BFS propagation to simulate thought
  propagation through THE MESH.  This feature maps similarity scores to oscillation frequencies and
  amplitudes, creating dynamic visual representations of information flow.
insights:
  - >-
    Core wave physics engine (wave-controller.ts) enables BFS propagation and three-phase animation
    (pulse, settling, standing wave).
  - >-
    Oscillation frequencies are mapped to similarity scores (0.5-2.0 Hz) and amplitude to
    similarity² for non-linear visual emphasis.
  - >-
    Glow sprite and edge particle systems enhance visual feedback, with particle count optimized for
    performance.
  - >-
    Graph3d.ts was modified to store Three.js objects on nodes and integrate wave controller
    functionality.
  - >-
    Synthesizer.ts now preserves similarity scores, returning an array of {id, similarity} for wave
    visualization.
  - The +page.svelte component triggers wave animations based on query results and activated nodes.
