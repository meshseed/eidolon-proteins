title: 'Coherence as Embedding Density: Rethinking AI Synthesis Metrics'
summary: >-
  Coherence in AI synthesis, particularly in systems like THE MESH, functions as a measure of
  semantic clustering strength in embedding space, not necessarily direct quality. Artificial
  normalization of coherence scores can break natural clustering and hinder retrieval.
insights:
  - Coherence reflects semantic clustering density, not direct synthesis quality.
  - Artificial normalization of coherence scores can lead to the promotion of irrelevant content.
  - >-
    High coherence (0.95-1.00) indicates well-formed semantic clusters, a desirable feature for
    retrieval.
  - >-
    Alternative metrics like last_accessed, synapse count, and activation frequency are better for
    metabolism adaptation than relying on normalized coherence.
  - >-
    Reverting artificial normalization allows metabolism systems to work with natural embedding
    quality signals.
