title: 'MeshCODE: Talin Switches as Cellular Data Storage and Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that talin mechanical switches within cell adhesions act as a binary
  code (0s and 1s) for data storage and computation. In stable environments, cells can actively
  manipulate these switches to record information, transforming adhesions into data-storage devices
  and the cell into a mechanical computer.
insights:
  - >-
    Talin mechanical switches, in a folded ('0') or unfolded ('1') state, enable binary data storage
    within cell adhesions.
  - >-
    Cells can actively use their force-generating machinery to write data into talin switches in
    predictable extracellular environments.
  - >-
    Cell adhesions, governed by MeshCODE, function as data-storage devices and perform calculations,
    with results stored in switch conformations.
  - >-
    Changes in cellular cytoskeleton and contractility, modulated by Rho-family GTPases, trigger
    calculations and alter switch states.
  - >-
    The appearance of talin facilitated persistent information storage in multicellular organisms,
    akin to computer disk writing.
