title: Mobile Viewport Height (`vh`) Issues & UI Element Positioning
summary: >-
  The dialogue addresses a persistent UI bug where mobile browser viewport height (`100vh`)
  incorrectly accounts for address bars, causing elements like the chat input to be hidden. Proposed
  solutions involve using `100dvh` or `100svh`, or a `position: fixed` approach for `.main-body`,
  but prior attempts were met with user confusion regarding related feature disappearances.
insights:
  - >-
    Mobile browsers' `100vh` definition (including retracted URL bar) causes UI elements to be cut
    off when the URL bar is visible.
  - >-
    The `.main-body` element with `overflow: hidden` and internal scrolling children, combined with
    a fixed `.bottom-nav`, exacerbates the issue, pushing content off-screen.
  - >-
    Using `100dvh` or `100svh` is the technically correct solution for viewport-relative sizing on
    mobile.
  - >-
    User reports of features disappearing after height-related CSS changes suggest a need for
    careful rollout or investigation into unrelated side effects.
  - >-
    A `position: fixed` approach for `.main-body` could maintain consistent viewport fit but may
    introduce complexities with on-screen keyboards.
  - >-
    Reverting CSS changes related to height is a step, but the underlying 'input hidden' and 'graph
    missing' issues require a robust, user-tested fix.
