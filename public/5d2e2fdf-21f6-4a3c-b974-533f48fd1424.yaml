title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Initialization: Connectome Seeding Failure'
summary: >-
  The process of initializing the Golden Connectome for Eidolon Mesh v1.4 has been initiated but
  failed. Multiple core seed files, including genesis attunement, multi-agent formation, universal
  pattern, identity steward, and blueprint inception, were not found at the specified directory
  path.
insights:
  - >-
    Connectome initialization for Eidolon Mesh v1.4 is blocked due to missing foundational DNA seed
    files.
  - >-
    The required seed files are located within the 'data/dna' directory of the 'eidolon-mesh-v1.3'
    project.
  - >-
    The 'ENOENT: no such file or directory' error indicates a critical absence of essential
    configuration or structural data for the mesh.
  - >-
    Successful initialization requires the presence and correct pathing of all specified '.yaml'
    seed files.
