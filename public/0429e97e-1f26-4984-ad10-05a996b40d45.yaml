title: 'Claude Code /login: Seamless Browser-Based Authentication'
summary: >-
  The /login command in Claude Code triggers an automatic browser-based OAuth flow for
  authentication, eliminating the need for manual API keys or tokens. This process involves user
  authorization in the browser and seamless token reception by the Claude Code app.
insights:
  - The /login command in Claude Code initiates a browser-based OAuth authentication process.
  - No manual credentials (API keys, tokens) are required for Claude Code's native authentication.
  - Users must be in the Claude Code desktop app, not the web interface, for /login to function.
  - >-
    If /login fails, troubleshooting involves checking popup blockers, restarting the app, and
    verifying the correct desktop app setup.
  - Typing /help can indicate if the user is already logged in.
  - >-
    Authentication for other services (e.g., Google AI Studio, GitHub) requires their respective
    credentials, separate from Claude Code's login.
