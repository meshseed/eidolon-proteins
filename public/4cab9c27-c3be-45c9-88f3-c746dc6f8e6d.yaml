title: Identifying Semantic Bridge Neurons via Centrality Approximations
summary: >-
  This research introduces a protocol to identify 'bridge neurons' connecting distant semantic
  regions by approximating betweenness centrality.  It leverages cross-domain activation and
  semantic span to reveal the connective tissue of the information manifold, supporting
  developmental trajectory tracking and domain integration.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons exhibit high cross-regional activation and broad semantic span.
  - Centrality can be approximated by recurrence across diverse and unrelated contexts.
  - >-
    Bridge neurons act as stabilizers, linking distant attractors and ensuring informational
    coherence.
  - >-
    Identifying these bridges illuminates the underlying structure and connectivity of semantic
    space.
  - This analysis supports tracking developmental trajectories and integrating disparate domains.
