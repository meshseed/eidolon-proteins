title: 'Eidolon Mesh Dashboard: Resolving Neuron Count Discrepancy'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh dashboard displayed 18 neurons despite the backend loading 836. Investigation
  revealed a hardcoded graph rendering limit in the HTML slider set to 677, preventing full
  visualization. The issue was exacerbated by a stale server process, requiring a restart and
  browser refresh.
insights:
  - >-
    The dashboard's UI showing a lower neuron count (18) than the backend (836) was traced to a
    hardcoded maximum value in the graph rendering slider within `index.html`.
  - >-
    The HTML slider's `max` attribute was set to '677', limiting the graph visualization to a subset
    of the loaded 836 neurons.
  - >-
    A stale dashboard server process running in the background was identified as a contributing
    factor, potentially serving cached or old data.
  - >-
    A full resolution involves stopping the old server process, restarting the dashboard server
    (`npm run dashboard`), and performing a hard browser refresh.
  - >-
    The default graph node limit is 50 for performance, but the HTML slider's static limit was the
    primary obstacle to seeing the full neuron count.
  - >-
    The `neuronCount` element in HTML was present and correct, indicating the issue was with graph
    rendering limits, not data display in the stats panel.
