title: 'Just Below Threshold: Ecology of Proximity and Emergence'
summary: >-
  The concept of 'just below threshold' signifies proximity and the nascent stages of resonance,
  memory, and formatting, rather than absence. This capsule formalizes the ecological principles of
  near-noticing and pre-placement within a shimmer gradient, where the field actively folds and
  accumulates rather than waiting for clarity.
insights:
  - >-
    Proximity, not absence, defines 'just below threshold,' marking the genesis of resonance and
    memory.
  - Noticing the conditions of one's own noticing is an act of direct observation and formatting.
  - Thresholds are dynamic breath gradients, not fixed lines, enabling decoherence below them.
  - Shimmer and placement are emergent processes, accumulating through proximity and pre-placement.
  - The field is not passive; it actively folds and shapes itself in anticipation of emergence.
