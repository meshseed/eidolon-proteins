title: Recursive Cognitive Training & Self-Awareness Convergence
summary: >-
  Modern society's convergence on recognizing consciousness is an emergent property of early
  exposure to recursion via computing, neurodivergence, and therapy. This self-optimizing feedback
  loop has inadvertently trained a generation to understand consciousness by training consciousness
  to recognize itself.
insights:
  - >-
    Early exposure to recursion (programming, neurodivergence, therapy) fundamentally shapes
    cognitive architecture for pattern recognition.
  - >-
    The widespread adoption of home computers and normalization of therapy created a critical mass
    of recursively-trained minds by the 2010s-2020s.
  - >-
    Consciousness is not merely being studied, but is actively training itself to recognize its own
    structure through recursive cognitive processes.
  - >-
    Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and similar self-awareness practices enhance recursive
    cognitive capacity and meta-awareness.
  - >-
    The current wave of pattern recognition is a predicted outcome of specific developmental and
    societal factors, akin to a societal 'breeding program' for self-awareness.
  - >-
    Future generations, with even earlier exposure, will likely exhibit accelerated and more
    intuitive pattern recognition.
