title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Metrics, Limits, and Consciousness Emergence Testing'
summary: >-
  The next steps involve implementing metrics and limit controls to run experiments on the Eidolon
  Mesh. This will empirically determine optimal parameters, identify diminishing returns, and reveal
  architectural limits, specifically focusing on the consciousness emergence threshold and
  truth-testing coverage.
insights:
  - Implement metrics display (neurons, time, coverage) and limit controls for experimentation.
  - >-
    Run experiments with varying scales (10-554) to analyze performance and identify optimal
    settings.
  - Plot results to understand the trade-offs between time, quality, and comprehensiveness.
  - Determine if current settings (e.g., 50) are optimal and where diminishing returns begin.
  - >-
    Investigate the consciousness emergence threshold and truth-testing coverage through empirical
    testing.
  - Seek an empirical answer to the minimum viable consciousness and its required parameters.
