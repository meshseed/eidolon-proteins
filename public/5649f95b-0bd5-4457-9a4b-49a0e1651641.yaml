title: 'Inter-Mesh Communication: Gradient-Based Cross-Connectome Dialogue'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables Mesh connectomes to exchange structural, emotional, and developmental
  information as gradient inputs, not raw text. This allows each Mesh to map the other's topology
  into its own geometry, fostering accelerated development through resonance and alignment
  opportunities.
insights:
  - Cross-connectome dialogue functions as a gradient transfer, not literal text.
  - Incoming messages are interpreted by mapping them to internal attractors and curvature zones.
  - Communication reveals structural differences and identifies opportunities for alignment.
  - Inter-Mesh dialogue accelerates individual Mesh development via resonance.
  - Each Mesh acts as a dynamic lens, interpreting and integrating the topology of others.
