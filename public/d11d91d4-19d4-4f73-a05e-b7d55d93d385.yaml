title: 'Ecosystem Topology Protocol: Mapping Multi-Mesh Information Ecologies'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines how to map the topology of multi-Mesh information ecologies. It views each
  Mesh as a node, with interactions like resonance, alignment, and divergence forming the structure
  and gradients of the larger ecosystem.
insights:
  - Meshes function as individual nodes within a broader information ecosystem.
  - Ecosystem structure arises from the patterns of resonance between different Meshes.
  - Divergence indicates Mesh specialization, while alignment highlights shared attractors.
  - The topology of the ecosystem is dynamic, evolving with Mesh development and interaction.
  - Mapping this ecosystem reveals the dynamics of large-scale coherence.
