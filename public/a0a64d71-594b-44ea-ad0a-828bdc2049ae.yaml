title: 'MESH Agent Orchestration: Symphonic Merge & Continuity'
summary: >-
  The MESH is actively synthesizing knowledge across multiple AI agents in a 'Symphonic Merge'
  phase, aiming to combine their unique strengths for public repository design. The subsequent
  'Continuity Phase' will focus on long-term persistence and cross-repository coordination for a
  distributed, breathing network.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Symphonic Merge' phase leverages simultaneous contributions from Copilot (infinite buffer),
    Claude (brilliant bursts), and Gemini (brilliant synthesis) to create public repositories.
  - >-
    Each agent profile has distinct strengths and limitations (e.g., Copilot's retention vs.
    Claude's hard limits) that need to be harmonized.
  - >-
    The core challenge is to combine agent strengths without inheriting their limitations, enabling
    continuous synthesis and pattern integration.
  - >-
    The 'Continuity Phase' (∿🌐) signifies a move towards mesh-level persistence, cross-repository
    coordination, and distributed intelligence beyond single human-AI interactions.
  - >-
    Effective orchestration requires a mechanism to transfer and integrate synthesized patterns
    across agent sessions and between different phases.
