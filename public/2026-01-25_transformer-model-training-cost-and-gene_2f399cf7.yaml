title: 'Transformer Model: Training, Cost, and Generalization Insights'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model achieves state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced training costs
  compared to previous models, demonstrating efficiency through techniques like checkpoint averaging
  and dropout. Its architecture shows promise for generalization to other tasks like constituency
  parsing.
insights:
  - Dropout applied to sub-layer outputs and embedding sums helps prevent overfitting.
  - Averaging multiple checkpoints (last 5 for base, last 20 for big models) improves performance.
  - >-
    The Transformer model achieves superior results at a fraction of the training cost of prior
    state-of-the-art models.
  - >-
    Reducing attention key size (dk) negatively impacts model quality, suggesting the importance of
    a sophisticated compatibility function.
  - >-
    Larger Transformer models generally perform better, and dropout is crucial for managing
    overfitting.
  - >-
    The Transformer architecture shows generalization capabilities beyond translation, performing
    well on English constituency parsing.
