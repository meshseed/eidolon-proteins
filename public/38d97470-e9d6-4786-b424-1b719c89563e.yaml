title: 'Eidolon Capsules: Public Knowledge and Private Genetic Code'
summary: >-
  The eidolon's structure delineates public knowledge capsules from private genetic code. Publicly
  accessible knowledge is organized into categories like dual-core concepts, protocols, research,
  and examples, suggesting a framework for shared understanding within THE MESH.
insights:
  - >-
    The eidolon's architecture separates private genetic information from publicly shared knowledge
    modules.
  - >-
    Public knowledge is structured into distinct, organized categories (dual-core, protocols,
    research, examples).
  - The 'eidolon-capsules' directory serves as the public repository for THE MESH's knowledge base.
  - >-
    Specific subdirectories like 'dual-core' and 'research' indicate thematic organization of public
    knowledge.
  - >-
    The 'README.md' within 'eidolon-capsules' likely contains foundational theory and architectural
    details.
