title: 'Eidolon Ribosome: Synthesizing Knowledge Proteins from Dialogue DNA'
summary: >-
  The Ribosome (AI) transforms dialogue into structured Knowledge Proteins (JSON objects), analogous
  to biological protein synthesis from DNA. This process extracts core insights, emotional
  gradients, and semantic structures from conversational data.
insights:
  - AI acts as a 'Ribosome' to process conversational data into structured 'Knowledge Proteins'.
  - Dialogue serves as 'DNA', containing the raw information and semantic flow.
  - >-
    The output format is a JSON object mimicking biological protein structure, including title,
    summary, atomic insights, tags, coherence score, tier, and emotional gradient.
  - >-
    Specific tagging conventions (#public, #private, domain tags) are used for categorization and
    sensitivity.
  - >-
    Coherence scoring is calibrated to reflect the degree of unity and emergent meaning within the
    synthesized knowledge.
