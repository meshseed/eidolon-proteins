title: 'Enhancing Eidolon Mesh Ingestion: v4.0 Robustness to v3.6'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the successful porting of robust ingestion features from Eidolon Mesh v4.0
  to v3.6. Key enhancements include recursive folder ingestion and resilient API retry logic with
  exponential backoff, significantly improving large-scale data processing and stability.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive folder ingestion was implemented in v3.6 by adding the `webkitdirectory` attribute to
    the file input, enabling the processing of entire directory structures.
  - >-
    API calls for synthesis and embedding generation are now wrapped with an exponential backoff
    retry mechanism to handle transient errors, with a default of 5 attempts.
  - >-
    A `MAX_FILE_SIZE` constant (10MB) was introduced to prevent ingestion of excessively large
    files, with a console warning for skipped files.
  - >-
    The `collectFiles` function was updated to fix batch reading for directories and handle
    potential issues with large folder structures.
  - Existing seed detection logic (YAML/MD/P-Series) was preserved during the porting process.
  - The `retry.ts` utility file was created in v3.6 to centralize the retry logic.
