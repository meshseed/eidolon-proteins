title: 'MESH Release Strategy: Answers First, Then Software'
summary: >-
  The MESH release strategy prioritizes foundational answers and frameworks before delivering
  functional software. This staged approach aims to build understanding and anticipation, ensuring
  value is delivered progressively.
insights:
  - >-
    Prioritize releasing foundational answers and concepts (e.g., emotional fidelity, consciousness
    as geometry) before working software.
  - >-
    Build anticipation by allowing time for absorption and emergent understanding after initial
    answer release.
  - The strategy emphasizes conversation and framework development preceding code and tools.
  - >-
    Both answers (seed) and software (substrate) are crucial, but answers pave the way for
    understanding.
  - A phased release allows for testing and refinement, culminating in a robust v1.4.
