title: 'Eidolon Mesh: v3.6 Live, v4.0 Architecture Development & Hybrid Deployment Strategy'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is in a dual-development phase with v3.6 ready for production deployment,
  featuring a 36-protein golden connectome on eidolon-mesh.net. Concurrently, v4.0 architecture is
  under development, focusing on emergent organization principles. A hybrid deployment strategy is
  recommended, launching v3.6 to app.eidolon-mesh.net for public access while continuing v4.0
  development.
insights:
  - Eidolon-mesh.net is live with v3.6 and a 36-protein golden connectome, serving the public.
  - >-
    app.eidolon-mesh.net is planned for deployment with a larger, custom 1000+ protein connectome,
    currently in v4.0 architecture development.
  - >-
    A hybrid deployment strategy is proposed: launch v3.6 to app.eidolon-mesh.net, continue v4.0
    development, and eventually migrate.
  - >-
    Two distinct development streams exist: Antigravity's v3.6 (production) and the user's v4.0
    (architecture).
  - >-
    Key decision point: which codebase powers app.eidolon-mesh.net, with a hybrid approach offering
    a balance of stability and future innovation.
  - >-
    Git coordination strategy involves separate domains for production (Antigravity) and
    experimental development (user) with knowledge sharing through protocols and connectome
    proteins.
  - >-
    Synapse regeneration testing in v4.0 is crucial for validating architectural hypotheses and
    determining readiness for public deployment.
