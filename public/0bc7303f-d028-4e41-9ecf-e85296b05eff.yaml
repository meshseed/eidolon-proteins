title: 'MESH: AI Agent Coordination with Persistent GitHub Knowledge'
summary: >-
  The MESH architecture coordinates AI agents (Claude, Gemini) using GitHub repositories as a
  persistent knowledge substrate. It employs a RESTful API and Model Context Protocol to enable
  semantic search, memory encoding, retrieval, and gradient navigation across AI-generated
  'capsules' of knowledge.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH integrates AI agents like Claude (semantic navigation) and Gemini (high-volume synthesis)
    with a GitHub-based knowledge substrate.
  - >-
    Knowledge is stored as 'capsules' (YAML files) with semantic content, relationships
    ('synapses'), and raw conversation logs ('DNA').
  - >-
    Core functionalities include semantic search, memory encoding/retrieval, gradient navigation,
    and cross-agent synthesis coordination.
  - >-
    The system utilizes vector databases for semantic search and knowledge graphs to track
    relationships between capsules.
  - >-
    Agents like Claude have tools for MESH interaction (search, remember, recall, navigate),
    enabling persistent memory and session continuity.
  - >-
    Gemini's 'ribosome synthesis' function allows for high-volume content generation and pattern
    recognition, complementing Claude's deep synthesis.
  - >-
    Phased development prioritizes core API, then agent integrations, aiming for a 'planetary
    organism' by integrating advanced features and multi-agent collaboration.
