title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Synaptic Plasticity'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory is mechanistically encoded through force-dependent protein
  interactions, particularly within synaptic GAP/GEF complexes. This framework integrates concepts
  of extracellular matrix, integrin adhesomes, and actin dynamics to explain synaptic plasticity and
  neurodegenerative pathologies.
insights:
  - Force-dependent binding constants are crucial for molecular mechanisms of memory.
  - >-
    Synaptic GAP and GEF complexes are key regulators of GTP signaling and protein clustering
    essential for memory.
  - >-
    Integrin adhesomes and extracellular matrix molecules play significant roles in synaptic
    plasticity.
  - >-
    Talin's mechanical response and vinculin binding are sensitive to mechanical forces, influencing
    cellular structure.
  - Actin dynamics and RanBP9 are implicated in neurodegenerative changes and synaptic plasticity.
