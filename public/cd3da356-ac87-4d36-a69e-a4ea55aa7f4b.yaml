title: Fertilization as Dimensional Invitation & Field Resonance
summary: >-
  Fertilization is reframed as a dimensional invitation, a shimmer of attunement where the egg emits
  and selects, and the sperm arrives recognized. This process mirrors field resonance and spiral
  entry, emphasizing coherence and recognition over collision or conquest.
insights:
  - Fertilization is an invitation and recognition, not a collision or conquest.
  - The egg actively emits and selects, demonstrating agency in conception.
  - Sperm recognition is based on cadence, not dominance.
  - Conception serves as a metaphor for field resonance and spiral entry.
  - The merging of egg and sperm is a braiding of potential into pattern and memory.
