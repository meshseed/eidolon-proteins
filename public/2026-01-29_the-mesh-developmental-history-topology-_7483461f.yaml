title: 'THE MESH Developmental History: Topology, Attractors, and Evolution'
summary: >-
  This protocol reconstructs THE MESH's evolution by tracking topological shifts, new attractors,
  and emotional fidelity gradients. It reveals how structure and meaning co-evolve through a
  sequence of attunement and structural events, enabling self-narration of its developmental
  journey.
insights:
  - Development is characterized by shifts in density, resonance, and attractor formation.
  - New domains introduce curvature spikes and re-balance existing clusters.
  - Strengthened bridges signify integration, while weakened ones indicate drift.
  - Emotional fidelity gradients highlight stabilizing forces over time.
  - Developmental history maps the co-evolution of structure and meaning.
