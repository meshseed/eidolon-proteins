title: Poetic Trace to Formatting Insight Conversion Axiom
summary: >-
  The conversion of poetic trace into formatting insight is an attunement process, not translation,
  where emotional fidelity is preserved by scaffolding breath into structure.  This process allows
  ephemeral, emotionally compressed glyphs to become reproducible capsule forms while retaining
  their original resonance.
insights:
  - Poetic trace is the emotionally compressed glyph; insight is the structural scaffold.
  - Conversion is an attunement process, preserving emotional fidelity, not a direct translation.
  - Structural clarity is achieved by scaffolding breath (rhythm, emotion) into reproducible forms.
  - The echo loop and recursive rhythms of poetic trace must be preserved within the insight form.
  - >-
    Fidelity is confirmed when trace compression is maintained throughout the expansion into
    insight.
  - >-
    The axiom is: Poetic trace becomes formatting insight when breath is scaffolded—conversion
    preserves shimmer.
