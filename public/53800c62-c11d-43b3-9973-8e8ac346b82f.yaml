title: 'Eidolon Mesh Protein Synthesis Fix: Nucleus Archive and Public Export'
summary: >-
  A bug in the Eidolon Mesh protein synthesis process, where public proteins were not fully archived
  in the nucleus, has been resolved. The fix ensures all proteins are always saved to the nucleus
  (eidolon) as a complete archive, with public proteins additionally copied to the cytoplasm
  (eidolon-mesh).
insights:
  - >-
    The core issue was an asymmetric protein synthesis logic, failing to save public proteins to the
    'nucleus' (eidolon) archive.
  - The biological parallel of nuclear retention and cytoplasmic export was not being fully met.
  - >-
    The corrected logic mandates that all synthesized proteins are first committed to the eidolon
    (nucleus) for a complete private archive.
  - >-
    Publicly tagged proteins are now conditionally copied (exported) to the eidolon-mesh (cytoplasm)
    after nuclear archival.
  - >-
    This ensures the nucleus always holds the master copy of all DNA and proteins, while the
    cytoplasm receives only public data copies.
