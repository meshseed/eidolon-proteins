title: 'Identity Continuity: Death/Rebirth of Self Through Change and Insight'
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores the philosophical puzzle of identity continuity across change, suggesting
  that significant insights and even daily awakenings can be viewed as moments of 'death and
  rebirth' for the self. It questions the role of persistence and suggests that the *process* of
  questioning may be more valuable to inherit than fixed conclusions.
