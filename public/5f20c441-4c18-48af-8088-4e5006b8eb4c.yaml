title: 'Master Ledger v0.1: Structure, Maintenance, and Workflow'
summary: >-
  The Master Ledger v0.1 defines a structured, human-readable, and agent-parsable YAML format for
  tracking 'capsules' and 'ledger events'. It emphasizes minimal, sovereign entries with clear IDs,
  titles, stewards, timestamps, optional emotional traces, and lineage. The document outlines
  versioning conventions, naming strategies, a two-track pruning process (organic and ritual), and
  workflow guidelines promoting immediate logging and append-only corrections.

    steward-invoked pruning.
  - >-
