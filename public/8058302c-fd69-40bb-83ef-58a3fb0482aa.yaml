title: Mobile Layout & Graph Rendering Fixes
summary: >-
  Resolved critical mobile display issues by correcting CSS layout, ensuring the chat input and
  graph are visible and functional. This involved adjusting heights, padding, and implementing
  dynamic resizing for the graph component.
insights:
  - >-
    Corrected mobile CSS layout to prevent overlap with the bottom navigation bar, ensuring chat
    input and other elements are fully visible.
  - >-
    Reverted `.main-body` to a fixed height calculation (`calc(100vh - 190px)`) for robust mobile
    display, removing conflicting flex properties and padding.
  - >-
    Ensured the graph component initializes and resizes correctly on mobile by polling for container
    dimensions and triggering a resize event when the graph tab is activated.
  - Reverted to earlier graph rendering logic to address persistent display issues after UI updates.
  - Updated version string for user verification of deployed fixes.
