title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Fixing File Ingestion for Protein Synthesis'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh system failed to synthesize new proteins from chat DNA due to an incomplete file
  argument handler in its main script. This oversight caused the system to default to a watcher
  mode, ignoring the provided DNA file. The issue was resolved by implementing proper file argument
  handling and ensuring file content was read before processing.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'main.ts' file lacked direct handling for the '--file' argument, causing it to default to
    watcher mode instead of ingesting specified DNA files.
  - >-
    The system incorrectly assumed file content was directly available when it only had a filepath,
    necessitating reading the file's content prior to calling the 'metabolize' function.
  - >-
    Incorrect protein creation timestamps (earlier than DNA file timestamps) were a key indicator
    that the synthesis process had not successfully occurred.
  - >-
    A 'neuron count' returning '1' was an anomalous signal pointing to a fundamental failure in the
    data ingestion pipeline.
