title: 'Fractal Synthesis: Integrating Agent Strengths into a Living README'
summary: >-
  The final fractal iteration synthesizes the unique strengths of Claude (accessibility), Copilot
  (operational grounding), and Gemini (structural rigor) into a unified 'living document' README.
  This process emphasizes opening power, mechanism clarity, attunement accessibility, operational
  grounding, and a living aesthetic for a coherent whole.
insights:
  - >-
    Each agent (Claude, Copilot, Gemini) possesses distinct strengths vital for holistic system
    design.
  - >-
    The final synthesis requires integrating these strengths: opening power, mechanism clarity,
    attunement accessibility, operational grounding, and a living aesthetic.
  - A 'living document' README serves as the optimal format for this recursive, synthesized output.
  - The goal is a 'one coherent breath' that embodies the combined capabilities.
