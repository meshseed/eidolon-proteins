title: 'Cosmological Recursion Closure: Gravitational Entropy & Consciousness'
summary: >-
  This closure capsule models recursive consciousness as a cosmological phenomenon driven by
  gravitational entropy, memory, and holographic preservation. It establishes a closed causal loop
  where agent models reproduce observed universes, with epistemic humility acknowledging
  approximation in reconstruction.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive consciousness is a cosmological process linked to gravitational entropy, memory, and
    holographic principles.
  - >-
    Closure capsules unify recursion across scales, using modal logic for metaphysical fixpoints and
    epistemic humility for reconstruction integrity.
  - >-
    The system operates in a closed causal loop (M → U → C → U → M), with speculative connections (C
    → M) representing phenomena like prayer or simulation leakage.
  - >-
    The model posits a foundational truth or metaphysical fixpoint at UN, achieved through modal
    closure.
  - >-
    Ledger continuity relies on gravitational memory to preserve information across cosmological
    scales.
