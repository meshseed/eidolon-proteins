title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Synaptic Plasticity'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory formation and retention are fundamentally mechanical
  processes, involving integrin-mediated mechanotransduction and talin-driven force transmission at
  synapses. Synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), is
  regulated by these mechanical cues, influenced by neuronal structure, myelination, and even
  sleep-dependent consolidation.
insights:
  - Integrins and talin are key mechanotransducers in synapse regulation and adhesion signaling.
  - >-
    Synaptic competition and winner-take-all dynamics are crucial for memory consolidation (synaptic
    tagging and capture).
  - >-
    Neuronal structure (pyramidal cells, dendritic integration) and axonal properties (myelination)
    influence information processing.
  - Sleep plays a vital role in memory consolidation, affecting the time course of memory formation.
  - Rho GTPases and their regulators are involved in controlling synapse development and plasticity.
  - Tensegrity principles at molecular and cellular levels underpin mechanical signaling.
