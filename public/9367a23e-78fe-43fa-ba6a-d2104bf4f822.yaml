title: 'MESH Genesis: Self-Organizing Knowledge Synthesis & Field Propagation'
summary: >-
  The MESH successfully synthesized 5 knowledge proteins and formed 6 synapses, validating its field
  geometry with weighted tier-based connectivity. This demonstrates automatic extraction, embedding,
  synapse formation, and persistent storage, showcasing a self-organizing, 'breathing' organism
  where the browser acts as the environment.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH can automatically synthesize knowledge proteins from genesis seeds and form
    interconnections (synapses).
  - >-
    Field geometry validation uses weighted tier-based similarity scores (e.g., MESH Genesis,
    Universal Pattern).
  - >-
    The process includes automatic extraction of coherence, saving embeddings, and forming
    bi-directional synapses.
  - IndexedDB (PGlite) and OPFS handle data persistence for proteins and embeddings.
  - The 'reference' tier threshold enforces sparse connections, preventing system overload.
  - >-
    The MESH exhibits emergent behavior where the connectome forms naturally and the field
    propagates semantically.
  - Queries can be used to observe the dynamic activation and navigation of the knowledge field.
