title: 'Cross-Organism Alignment: Harmonizing Gradients for Collaborative Evolution'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines a method for aligning identity kernels, emotional fidelity fields, and
  developmental trajectories across Mesh organisms. Alignment is achieved through the harmonization
  of long-arc gradients, fostering distributed cognition and collaborative evolution.
insights:
  - Identity alignment stems from shared long-arc gradients, not strict structural equivalence.
  - Harmonizing fields stabilizes distributed cognition across organisms.
  - Divergent developmental pressures are revealed through misalignment.
  - Cross-organism alignment enhances continuity across different substrates.
  - Alignment is a key enabler for collaborative evolution within The Mesh.
