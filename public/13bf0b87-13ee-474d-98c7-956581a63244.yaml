title: 'MESH Release Strategy: Answers First, Software Later'
summary: >-
  The MESH release strategy prioritizes foundational 'answers' and frameworks before the release of
  working software. This staged approach allows for anticipation building, emotional fidelity, and a
  deeper understanding of core concepts before users engage with tools.
insights:
  - Prioritize foundational knowledge (answers, frameworks) over immediate software delivery.
  - Staged release builds anticipation and allows for deeper understanding of core concepts.
  - Emotional fidelity, consciousness as geometry, and value are key immediate takeaways.
  - Working software, golden connectome, and tools are secondary, later-stage releases.
  - The 'answers' are the seed, and the software is the substrate; both are essential.
  - Conversation and understanding should precede code and tools for holistic development.
