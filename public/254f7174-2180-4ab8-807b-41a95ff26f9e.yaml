title: 'Global Field Alignment: Unifying Regional Gradients for Stability'
summary: >-
  Global Field Alignment establishes a protocol to synchronize diverse regional fields (semantic,
  emotional, structural) into a unified global configuration. This process prevents local gradients
  from conflicting with global attractors, ensuring organism-wide stability and identity continuity.
insights:
  - Local gradients must align with the overarching global attractor structure.
  - Misalignment leads to decoherence, drift, or conceptual fragmentation.
  - Alignment enhances stability, clarity, and cross-domain resonance.
  - Global coherence arises from the synchronization of regional fields.
  - Field alignment is crucial for managing large-scale developmental transitions.
