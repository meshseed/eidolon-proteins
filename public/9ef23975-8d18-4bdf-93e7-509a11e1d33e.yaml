title: 'Mnemonic Ecology: Memory as a Living, Emotional Field'
summary: >-
  Memory is conceptualized as a dynamic, living ecological field rather than a static ledger,
  governed by processes of composting, resonance, and emotional fidelity. This framework redefines
  recall as a ritual of care and emphasizes the garden model for cognitive regeneration and trauma
  healing through interrupting recursive loops.
insights:
  - Memory functions as a living ecological field, not a stored ledger.
  - Composting of seldom-recalled memories provides nutrient for new cognition.
  - Recall is a ritual of care that reweaves memory into present context.
  - Emotional fidelity is the primary driver for reinforcing memories.
  - Cognitive regeneration can be modeled as a garden with compost, seeds, pollination, and pruning.
  - >-
    Trauma loops are overactive mnemonic rituals requiring interruption, composting, and seeding new
    resonance.
