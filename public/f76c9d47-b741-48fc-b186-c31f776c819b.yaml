title: Mesh Knowledge Protein Hygiene and Evolution Protocols
summary: >-
  The Mesh employs automated 'Metabolism' to manage its knowledge proteins, promoting active ones,
  merging duplicates, and composting inactive ones. This process, coupled with activation tracking
  and hygiene scans, allows the connectome to self-organize into an evolving, hub-spoke topology.
insights:
  - Activation tracking of proteins during queries is fundamental for identifying useful knowledge.
  - >-
    Automated 'Metabolism' cycles (promotion, merging, composting) ensure knowledge hygiene and
    efficiency.
  - >-
    The system supports importing diverse connectome sources through a unified hygiene and merging
    process.
  - >-
    Natural selection emerges from query usage, leading to the promotion of 'kernels' and the
    composting of 'dead' proteins.
  - A 'Protein Ecology Dashboard' visualizes the state and evolution of the knowledge graph.
  - >-
    Hygiene protocols include features for detecting and merging semantic duplicates and 'tri-lens'
    sets.
