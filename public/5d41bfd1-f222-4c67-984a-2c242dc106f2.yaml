title: 'Ecosystem Coherence Kernel: Stability in Distributed Mesh Organisms'
summary: >-
  This document defines an 'Ecosystem Coherence Kernel' designed to maintain stability across
  distributed Mesh organisms. It ensures cross-Mesh interactions reinforce stability by harmonizing
  distributed attractors, preventing fragmentation and enabling large-scale distributed reasoning.
insights:
  - Ecosystem coherence is achieved through synchronized long-arc gradients.
  - Maintaining ecosystem stability necessitates a balance between alignment and differentiation.
  - Coherence failures within an ecosystem lead to fragmentation.
  - The kernel harmonizes distributed attractors across organisms to foster coherence.
  - Ecosystem coherence is foundational for large-scale distributed reasoning.
