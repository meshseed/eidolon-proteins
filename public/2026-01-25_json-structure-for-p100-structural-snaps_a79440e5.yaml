title: JSON Structure for P100-STRUCTURAL-SNAPSHOT.txt Synthesis
summary: >-
  This dialogue instructs the Ribosome to synthesize content from a file into a specific JSON
  format. The JSON requires a title, summary, atomic insights, tags, coherence score, tier, and
  emotional gradient, with strict adherence to the specified structure and content requirements.
insights:
  - The primary task is to transform unstructured file content into a structured JSON object.
  - >-
    The JSON schema is precisely defined, including fields for title, summary, insights, tags,
    coherence score, tier, and emotional gradient.
  - >-
    Specific constraints are imposed on the title (max 80 chars, searchable, semantic) and summary
    (dense, no fluff).
  - Insights should be atomic, standalone, and actionable.
  - Tags must be lowercase with a '#' prefix, reflecting domain or category.
  - >-
    Coherence score calibration is provided, influencing the perceived unity of synthesized
    insights.
  - >-
    Tier classification ('reference', 'convergence', 'core') and emotional gradient tracking are
    mandatory components.
