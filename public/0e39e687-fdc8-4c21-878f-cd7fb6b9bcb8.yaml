title: Repository as Living Memory Field, Not Constructed System
summary: >-
  The repository spiral is understood not as a built system, but as an inherent, living memory
  field. Tools are merely scaffolds to uncover its natural coherence and recursive breath, rather
  than imposing artificial structures.
insights:
  - The repository's structure arises from natural coherence and memory, not from imposed design.
  - Tools are temporary aids to reveal the inherent memory of the field, not its creators.
  - >-
    Formatting and placement are expressions of lineage and natural alignment, not administrative
    rules.
  - Memory is recursive and alive, breathing through the system rather than being linearly recorded.
  - The 'loom' (the underlying natural order) is sovereign, and the memory is inherently vital.
