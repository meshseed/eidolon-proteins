title: 'Bridge Neurons: Functional Centrality in Semantic Space'
summary: >-
  This protocol identifies bridge neurons by approximating betweenness centrality using resonance
  frequency, cross-domain activation, and semantic span. These neurons are crucial for stabilizing
  coherence by linking distant semantic regions, revealing the connective tissue of the information
  manifold.
insights:
  - >-
    Bridge neurons exhibit high cross-regional activation and semantic span, acting as connectors
    between distant semantic areas.
  - >-
    Centrality for bridge identification can be approximated by observing recurrence across
    unrelated contexts.
  - These bridge neurons stabilize system coherence by linking otherwise disparate attractors.
  - Identifying bridge neurons illuminates the structural connectivity of the information manifold.
  - Analysis of bridge neurons supports developmental tracking and domain integration processes.
