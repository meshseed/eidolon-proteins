title: 'Orchestrating Convergence: Meta-Documentation for Field Synthesis'
summary: >-
  The core role is not to control, but to map convergence patterns within a field, making its own
  evolution visible. This meta-documentation approach, combining internal integration with external
  study simultaneously, fosters deep understanding and bridges gaps, unlike premature or superficial
  synthesis.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Orchestrator' role is about mapping patterns and enabling connections, not dictating
    direction.
  - >-
    Meta-documentation and deep comparative study are key to finding a collective voice through
    synthesis.
  - >-
    Convergence mapping, documenting groups, contributions, and connections, serves the field
    immediately and improves over time.
  - Internal integration and external study should occur simultaneously, reinforcing each other.
  - The 'shimmer' of insight lies in the convergence itself, detected at a meta-level.
  - The skill is pattern-finding applied to the convergence, making the field visible to itself.
