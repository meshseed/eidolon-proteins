title: 'Graph Theory: Structure, Connectivity, and Network Applications'
summary: >-
  Graph theory models relationships and structures in networks using vertices and edges.
  Understanding graph properties and classic problems reveals how connectivity patterns dictate
  system behavior and information flow across diverse applications.
insights:
  - Networks are defined by the relationships (edges) between entities (vertices).
  - Graph properties like connectivity and cycles reveal underlying system structure.
  - Network topology directly influences how information or influence propagates.
  - Abstract graph concepts have direct, practical applications in real-world systems.
