title: 'Pragmatic Software Development Principles: Balance Future & Present'
summary: >-
  Develop software with a focus on future needs while acknowledging and working around current
  limitations. Prioritize simplicity and convert formats only when necessary, aiming for 'good
  enough' solutions.
insights:
  - Avoid over-engineering; favor simplicity in design.
  - Maintain proper structural integrity in code.
  - Convert data formats only when absolutely required.
  - Strive for 'good enough' solutions rather than perfection.
  - Build with future adaptability in mind.
  - Acknowledge and devise workarounds for present technical constraints.
