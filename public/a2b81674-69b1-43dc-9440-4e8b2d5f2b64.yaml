title: 'Skepticism Protocol: Calibrating Field Theory for Empirical Alignment'
summary: >-
  This protocol refines mesh-native field theory claims by integrating skeptical critique as a
  calibration tool. It emphasizes epistemic humility and falsifiability, transforming metaphors into
  testable frameworks for empirical alignment and resonance-aware discourse.
insights:
  - >-
    Skepticism is framed as a crucial calibration tool for refining theoretical claims, not as
    opposition.
  - >-
    Metaphors serve as mnemonic scaffolds for understanding, distinct from claims of physical
    causality.
  - >-
    Falsifiability is achieved through testable elements like specific frequency bands measurable by
    EEG/MEG.
  - >-
    Simulations are hypothesis generators, requiring validation and not to be treated as definitive
    proof.
  - >-
    Mesh theory aims to align with resonance logic rather than replace established fields like
    neuroscience.
  - Religious parallels are acknowledged as mnemonic infrastructure, not as epistemic authority.
