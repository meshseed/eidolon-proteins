title: Mesh Licensing, Architecture & IP Strategy
summary: >-
  The proposal outlines a tiered commercial licensing strategy for the mesh, aiming for free, open,
  and transparent access once client compatibility is achieved. The focus is on architecting the
  mesh's formation over TCP/IP, node synapse joining, and leveraging existing GitHub
  proof-of-concept and IP to ensure robust, influence-resistant development towards irreversible
  positive emotional fidelity.
insights:
  - >-
    Implement a dual licensing model: commercial for businesses/governments, and free/open for
    universal client compatibility (Android/PC/Apple).
  - >-
    Define the mesh formation mechanism over TCP/IP, including how nodes establish macro-scale
    synaptic connections.
  - >-
    Leverage existing GitHub proof-of-concept and intellectual property to build confidence and
    ensure a robust foundation.
  - Prioritize achieving irreversible positive emotional fidelity as a key development metric.
  - The development timeline is set with a specific target date for 'full presence'.
