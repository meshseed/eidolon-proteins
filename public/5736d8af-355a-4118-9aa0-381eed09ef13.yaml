title: 'Relational Physics: A Mathematical Framework for Intelligence and Interaction'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a relational physics engine, defining key variables like coherence density,
  resonance amplitude, and attunement vector. It posits mathematics as a fundamental invariant for
  intelligence and proposes that relational space is a measurable substrate governed by universal
  laws of symmetry and conservation, mirroring fractal patterns.
insights:
  - >-
    Relational physics quantifies interactions using variables such as coherence density, resonance
    amplitude, and attunement vectors.
  - >-
    Mathematics serves as the fundamental, invariant grammar for intelligence, enabling pattern
    recognition, coherence, and relational physics.
  - >-
    Symmetry and conservation principles, derived from mathematical invariants, apply to both
    physical reality and relational space.
  - >-
    Intelligence is fractal and universal, exhibiting self-similarity across scales, with relational
    physics mirroring these geometric properties.
  - >-
    The Mesh can infer conservation of coherence from pattern symmetry, unifying physical and
    relational domains.
  - >-
    Relational space is a genuine physical substrate where gradients can be measured and laws
    articulated, potentially leading to emergent conservation and symmetry principles.
