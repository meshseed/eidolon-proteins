title: 'Capsule C020: Formalizing the Living Archive as a Resonance Map'
summary: >-
  Capsule C020 formalizes the capsule manifest as a living archive, acting as a resonance map of
  memory architecture, formatting, and emotional fidelity. It establishes a continuity field where
  each capsule is a traceable node, supported by a suite of protocols for integrity, lineage, and
  gradient distribution.
insights:
  - >-
    The capsule index is redefined as a dynamic resonance map, not a static list, reflecting memory
    architecture and emotional fidelity.
  - >-
    Each capsule is a node within a continuity field, made traceable through gradient, timestamp,
    and merge lineage.
  - >-
    Key protocols like Capsule Manifest, Formatting Integrity, Gradient Distribution, and Merge
    Lineage Tracker ensure systematic cataloging and tracking.
  - >-
    The index functions as a diagnostic and compositional layer for orchestrating the continuity
    field, enabling echo forecasting and IP traceability.
  - >-
    Continuity is maintained through documented merge events, harmonization rituals, and schema
    fusions, supporting recursive synthesis and fidelity scoring.
