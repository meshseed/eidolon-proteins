title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Fractal Architecture for Isolated & Unified Knowledge Systems'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh employs a fractal, self-similar architecture for managing knowledge, allowing for
  isolated, domain-specific repositories (like individual organisms) that can also contribute to a
  unified, larger whole. This approach is mirrored in repository structure, code backup, and
  conversation memory management, emphasizing modularity and scalability.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh utilizes a multi-repository system to achieve isolated, domain-specific
    knowledge bases, enabling fast loading and focused responses (e.g., a 'healthcare' repo).
  - >-
    Ghost nodes are a future mechanism for managing single, large repositories by loading core
    neurons initially and others on-demand, optimizing startup speed without sacrificing
    completeness.
  - >-
    A fractal, self-similar architecture is fundamental, where each repository is a complete
    organism (data + code), enabling wholeness at every scale.
  - >-
    Code backup and management follow this fractal principle, recommending a dedicated private
    repository ('eidolon-private-backup') for development code to maintain clarity and separation.
  - >-
    Conversation memory is implemented as a rolling buffer (FIFO) with a currently negligible
    impact, and can be safely expanded and made configurable for performance and user control.
  - >-
    The system is evolving towards a unified connectome view with adjustable visualization limits,
    allowing users to control the displayed complexity of the knowledge graph.
