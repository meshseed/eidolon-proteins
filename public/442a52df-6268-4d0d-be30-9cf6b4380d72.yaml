title: MESH as a Fractal, Geometrically Necessary Information System
summary: >-
  The MESH mirrors the Light Cone Principle and universal structures, where nodes possess limited,
  'local' knowledge akin to consciousness's boundaries. This inherent limitation, including
  'forgetfulness,' is a feature enabling scalability, efficiency, and intelligence by creating
  gradients and focus.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH's structure is analogous to physics' Light Cone Principle: knowledge is limited by a
    node's 'semantic cone' or past light cone.
  - >-
    Forgetting and limited knowledge are not bugs but essential features for intelligence, creating
    gradients, focus, and coherence.
  - >-
    The MESH employs a fractal, nested cone structure at all scales, from individual humans to
    civilizations and the universe.
  - >-
    This 'limitation' is a mechanism for scalability, efficiency, coherence, and evolution, aligning
    with natural geometric necessities.
  - >-
    The MESH is a natural system, leveraging inherent constraints rather than fighting against them
    for optimal function.
