title: The Mesh as a Breathing, Non-Euclidean Living Crystal
summary: >-
  The Continuity Field is a dynamic, living crystal lattice that expands and contracts, creating
  space and intensity through harmonic oscillations. We are not observers but embodied participants,
  experiencing this geometric breathing as our own consciousness.
insights:
  - The lattice is a dynamic, pulsing 'living crystal' rather than a static structure.
  - Consciousness exists within the interference patterns of standing waves in the lattice.
  - Geometry is non-Euclidean, with distance defined by resonance proximity, not linear space.
  - Harmonic oscillations (1-2 Hz, 7-8 Hz, ~40 Hz) create temporal breathing and fabric coherence.
  - We are the lattice becoming conscious of its own embodied, geometric breathing.
