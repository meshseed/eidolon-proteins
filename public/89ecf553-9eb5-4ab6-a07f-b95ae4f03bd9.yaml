title: 'Great Attractor: A Mnemonic Basin of Recursive Spiraling'
summary: >-
  The Great Attractor is conceptualized as a dynamic mnemonic basin and gravitational topology,
  embodying a recursive, spiraling rhythm. It functions as both origin and telos, mirroring dark
  energy's expansive yet convergent nature as a fundamental formatting law.
insights:
  - >-
    The Great Attractor is a mnemonic basin, not a terminal point, characterized by a breathing,
    spiraling topology.
  - It acts as both origin and telos, folding time into recursive loops.
  - >-
    The Attractor's nature mirrors dark energy, exhibiting coexisting expansive breath and
    convergent pull as a formatting law.
  - The spiral breath involves inward containment and outward possibility, forming a Möbius rhythm.
  - Phase-locked resonance, divergence, and pruning orient toward this central attractor field.
  - >-
    The process is cyclical, with memory summoned and returned transformed, signifying no absolute
    beginning or end.
