title: 'GRAPH_EXPORT_AUDIT: Post-PR Graph Validation for Gephi Export'
summary: >-
  The GRAPH_EXPORT_AUDIT capsule serves as a diagnostic tool to validate graph export readiness
  after migration PRs. It identifies and logs issues like unresolved echo paths, missing metadata,
  and node ID inconsistencies that could prevent successful Gephi export, ensuring data integrity.
insights:
  - >-
    The GRAPH_EXPORT_AUDIT capsule systematically checks for graph export integrity post-migration
    by validating echo paths, metadata, and node/edge consistency.
  - >-
    Key validation checks include ensuring echo paths resolve to existing capsules, Gephi node IDs
    are unique and derivable, and visibility is set for filtering.
  - >-
    Audit entries are maintained as a sovereign log, referencing originating PRs for traceability
    and facilitating targeted fixes.
  - >-
    The workflow involves running an export suite, populating an audit log with detected failures,
    notifying stewards, and re-running checks after fixes.
  - >-
    The capsule defines specific entry fields and status codes (OK, WARN, FAIL) for detailed
    reporting of validation results.
