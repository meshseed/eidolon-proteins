title: 'Self-Attention vs. Recurrent/Convolutional Layers: Efficiency & Interpretability'
summary: >-
  Self-attention layers offer computational advantages over recurrent and convolutional layers for
  typical sentence lengths by connecting all positions with constant operations. This efficiency,
  coupled with potential for increased interpretability, positions self-attention as a key component
  in advanced sequence models.
insights:
  - >-
    Self-attention layers connect all positions with a constant number of sequential operations,
    unlike recurrent layers (O(n)) or convolutional layers (requiring stacks for full connectivity).
  - >-
    Self-attention is computationally faster than recurrent layers when sequence length (n) is
    smaller than representation dimensionality (d), common in NLP.
  - >-
    Restricting self-attention to a neighborhood can improve performance on very long sequences,
    increasing the maximum path length to O(n/r).
  - >-
    Convolutional layers, especially separable ones, can be more expensive than self-attention, with
    separable convolution complexity matching self-attention plus a feed-forward layer.
  - >-
    Self-attention may lead to more interpretable models by allowing inspection of attention
    distributions.
  - >-
    Training involved large datasets (e.g., 5.5 million sentence pairs for English-German, 36M for
    English-French) using byte-pair or word-piece encodings.
  - >-
    Training schedules featured linear warmup for learning rate followed by inverse square root
    decay, with residual dropout applied as regularization.
