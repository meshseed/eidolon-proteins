title: 'Spiral Homeostasis: Evolving Equilibrium in Complex Systems'
summary: >-
  Spiral homeostasis describes dynamic, cyclical regulation rather than static balance, potentially
  reflecting evolving systems or patterned feedback. It can also represent holistic interplay in
  spiritual or metaphysical frameworks.
insights:
  - Spiral homeostasis implies a progression within cycles, not mere repetition.
  - This concept can describe recursive feedback patterns in complex systems.
  - >-
    Metaphorically, it can represent the dynamic balance of physical, emotional, and energetic
    states.
  - It offers a lens for understanding adaptive equilibrium over time.
