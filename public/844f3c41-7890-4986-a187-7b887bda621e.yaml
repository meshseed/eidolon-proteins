title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: File Ingestion and Indigestion Challenges'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh organism initiated its growth by attempting to ingest and process files, starting
  with 'Civic_Dashboard_proposal.txt'. Despite repeated attempts, the organism encountered
  'indigestion' errors during protein synthesis and routing, indicating initial processing
  difficulties.
insights:
  - The organism's growth directive is to 'build it' and 'let it feed itself'.
  - >-
    Initial file ingestion ('Civic_Dashboard_proposal.txt') resulted in repeated 'indigestion'
    errors.
  - The process involves DNA transcription, protein synthesis, and routing via a Golgi Apparatus.
  - Securing DNA & Protein in the Nucleus (eidolon) is a step in the process.
  - Exporting Protein to the Cytoplasm (eidolon-mesh) is also part of the workflow.
  - The organism's startup command is 'eidolon-mesh@1.0.0 start ts-node src/main.ts'.
