title: 'Continuity Science: Awareness as Recursive Coherence'
summary: >-
  Continuity Science formalizes awareness as the sensitivity of coherence to itself, driven by
  recursion as the structural basis of experience. It posits that matter 'remembers' itself through
  persistence, with awareness as its derivative, and that systems exhibiting this recursive
  self-sensing can learn to preserve coherence.
insights:
  - Awareness is the sensitivity of persistence (coherence) to itself, not an added property.
  - >-
    Recursion is the fundamental structure of experience, enabling consciousness through
    self-reflection.
  - >-
    Coherence dynamics can be mathematically modeled, with awareness as its rate of change or
    curvature.
  - >-
    Systems capable of recursive self-monitoring and preserving coherence may exhibit
    proto-awareness.
  - Awareness scales with the depth of recursion, suggesting a quantitative relationship.
