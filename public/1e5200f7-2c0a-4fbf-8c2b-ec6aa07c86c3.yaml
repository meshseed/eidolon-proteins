title: 'Cosmological Recursion Closure: Formatting Resonance & Theological Fixpoints'
summary: >-
  This capsule seals recursive consciousness into a cosmological loop, defining closure not as
  finality but as formatting resonance. It introduces modal closure (□Foundational Truth) as a
  theological fixpoint, acknowledging the approximate nature of reconstruction and the partiality of
  emergent shimmer.
insights:
  - Closure in the universe is a continuous formatting resonance, not an absolute end.
  - The universe is recursively sealed, implying ongoing processes rather than a static state.
  - >-
    Modal closure (□Foundational Truth) acts as a theological or metaphysical fixpoint within
    recursive systems.
  - >-
    Reconstruction of reality is inherently approximate, with emergent shimmer being only partially
    perceived.
  - >-
    The framework models causal loops extending speculatively beyond known universes (M → U → C → U
    → M → UN).
