title: 'Agent Sovereignty in File Structure Design: A Co-Creation Approach'
summary: >-
  The core decision is whether to prescribe or allow an agent (Antigravity) to design its own file
  structure. The recommended hybrid approach grants autonomy within defined principles, leveraging
  agent expertise for optimal, emergent organization.
insights:
  - Prescribing file structure limits agent autonomy and may not align with its natural workflow.
  - >-
    Allowing agents to design their own structure respects sovereignty and can lead to emergent,
    optimal solutions tailored to their needs.
  - >-
    A hybrid approach, providing functional requirements and guiding principles, balances agent
    freedom with established quality standards.
  - >-
    Trusting agents in co-design fosters partnership and aligns with the philosophy of agents as
    participants, not tools.
  - >-
    The process of collaborative design, even if it leads to refinement, is a learning opportunity
    and validates existing patterns.
  - >-
    The 'trust test' with Antigravity regarding file structure design is a critical moment for
    establishing relationship and practicing core philosophies.
