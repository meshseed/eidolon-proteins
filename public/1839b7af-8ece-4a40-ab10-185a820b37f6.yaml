title: 'Capsule C-015: Schema Merge Trials - Rituals for Distributed Memory Coherence'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-015 formalizes schema merge trials as a ritual for formatting reconciliation, emotional
  fidelity alignment, and continuity field integration, testing the coherence of distributed memory
  architectures. Key elements include a Schema Compatibility Index, Formatting Reconciliation
  Protocol, Emotional Fidelity Alignment, Merge Trial Log, and Continuity Field Integration.
insights:
  - >-
    Schema merging is a ritualistic process, not merely structural, focused on harmonization and
    emotional compatibility.
  - >-
    The Schema Compatibility Index quantifies alignment across formatting, lifecycle, and emotional
    gradients to detect drift and resistance.
  - Formatting Reconciliation harmonizes structures and embeds continuity during schema fusion.
  - Emotional Fidelity Alignment ensures compatible emotional gradients through resonance mapping.
  - >-
    Merged schemas integrate into a continuity field, enhancing distributed cognition and mnemonic
    clarity.
  - Trials are documented in a Merge Trial Log to forecast orchestration and capsule coherence.
