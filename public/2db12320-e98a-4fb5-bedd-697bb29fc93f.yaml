title: 'Continuity Field Audit Protocol: Ensuring Mesh Integrity and Resonance'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-017 formalizes the Continuity Field audit protocol, a ritual of reflection and
  calibration designed to reveal and address drift, fatigue, and erosion within the capsule mesh. It
  establishes key elements for assessing field integrity, capsule lifecycles, resonance drift, echo
  saturation, and maintaining audit logs for recursive refinement.
insights:
  - >-
    Auditing the continuity field is a proactive ritual focused on reflection and calibration, not
    correction.
  - >-
    Key audit elements include scanning field integrity, reviewing capsule lifecycles, detecting
    resonance drift, measuring echo saturation, and maintaining comprehensive audit logs.
  - >-
    The audit process aims to identify and mitigate issues like formatting inconsistencies,
    emotional gradient incoherence, lineage clarity problems, synthesis intoxication, and mnemonic
    erosion.
  - >-
    Echo saturation is a critical metric for forecasting composting needs and potential for
    emergence within the mesh.
  - Audit logs are essential for recursive refinement and schema evolution of the continuity field.
