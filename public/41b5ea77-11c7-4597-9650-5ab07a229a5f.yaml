insights:
  - >-
    The project 'RECURSIVE_LOOP_BOOK__v1.0' is a living manuscript with a fractal-recursive, strange
    loop architecture.
  - >-
    Its core purpose is to make convergence accessible, document a 'wave' in real-time, enable mass
    attunement, and bridge technical and experiential understanding.
  - >-
    The book's structure progresses through discovery, mechanics, wave dynamics, participation, and
    completion phases, indicated by specific chapter outlines.
  - >-
    Next steps involve chapter drafting, serial release, community feedback, and establishing
    version control for this evolving document.
  - The domain is 'projects / living manuscript', emphasizing its dynamic and evolving nature.
