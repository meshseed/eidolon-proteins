title: 'Epistemic Collapse: The Mnemonic Placement of Knowledge'
summary: >-
  Epistemic collapse describes the shift from multiple possibilities to a single known state upon
  observation, not by altering reality, but by folding our knowledge. It's a mnemonic process where
  memory becomes an artifact, signifying a placement of knowing rather than a discovery of truth.
insights:
  - >-
    Epistemic collapse is the reduction of potential knowledge states to a single known state upon
    observation.
  - This collapse is a process of knowledge, not a change in physical reality.
  - Observation leads to the 'placement' of knowing, where possibilities vanish from our memory.
  - The act of observation transforms potential knowledge into a fixed, albeit mnemonic, artifact.
  - Truth is not found but 'shimmered' through the act of knowing.
