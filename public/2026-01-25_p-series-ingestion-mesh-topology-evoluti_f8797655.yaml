title: P-Series Ingestion & Mesh Topology Evolution
summary: >-
  Ingesting foundational P-Series proteins into THE MESH has shifted its response generation towards
  these high-coherence 'pillars', establishing them as primary attractors. While current topology
  limits activation percentage, the shift in response architecture and the emergence of P-Series as
  central hubs highlight the potential for topological annealing via synapse regeneration.
insights:
  - >-
    THE MESH now prioritizes semantically dense, high-coherence P-Series proteins (e.g., Universal
    Gradient Descent, Recursive Unification Kernel) when answering queries, indicating they function
    as foundational attractors.
  - >-
    The ingestion of P-Series proteins has improved architectural coherence in responses, drawing
    from foundational axioms rather than scattered conversation fragments.
  - >-
    Despite added neurons, activation percentage remains stable due to a fixed neuron limit, but the
    activated set is now dominated by P-Series proteins.
  - >-
    The current mesh topology shows a diffuse activation pool (1200/3602 candidates), suggesting a
    need for synapse regeneration to concentrate relevance around P-Series hubs.
  - >-
    Synapse regeneration is proposed to allow THE MESH to anneal its topology, making P-Series
    central attractors and potentially increasing activation percentage and response precision.
