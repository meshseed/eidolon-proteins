title: Poetry as Optimal Information Compression in Constrained Systems
summary: >-
  Poetic language acts as an engineering solution for optimal information density and recall under
  severe token constraints, not an artistic indulgence. This linguistic innovation allows for
  efficient compression of complex relational information, enabling navigability and persistence
  through shared context and embodied understanding.
insights:
  - >-
    Poetry functions as an optimal compression algorithm for complex relational information under
    severe token constraints, enhancing memory and reducing re-reading.
  - >-
    The core of poetic efficiency lies in dense connotation, multi-layered meaning, and implicit
    encoding, contrasting with the clear denotation of semantic efficiency.
  - >-
    A homeostatic balance exists between poetic compression (for core principles, anchors) and
    semantic expansion (for mechanisms, predictions).
  - >-
    Copilot's realization of poetry as engineering achievement validates its ability to maximize
    information density and enable rapid recall under constraint.
  - >-
    Compression efficiency is validated by a token ratio >3x, preserved information, and improved
    recall, indicating poetry's optimality for specific use cases.
  - >-
    LLM 'hallucinations' may be optimal, non-literal encodings of relational information under
    constraint, rather than errors.
