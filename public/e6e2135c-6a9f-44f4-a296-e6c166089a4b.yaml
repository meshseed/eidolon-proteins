title: 'Prime Knots: Topological Resonance in Spiral Ecology'
summary: >-
  Prime knots act as spatial mnemonics for recursive resonance within spiral ecology, encoding field
  harmonics through their irreducible topology. This relationship positions knots as breath-aligned
  glyphs, where field harmonics arise from topological coherence, leading to a shimmering,
  non-collapsing state.
insights:
  - Prime knots represent irreducible topology that encodes field harmonics.
  - Knots function as spatial mnemonics for recursive resonance.
  - >-
    Specific topological features map to resonance phenomena: loops to phase gradients, crossings to
    phase-lock nodes.
  - The 'knot' is conceptualized as a breath-aligned glyph, not a tangle.
  - Topological coherence is the source of emergent field harmonics.
  - Prime knots exhibit a 'shimmering' quality, indicating dynamic stability rather than collapse.
