title: 'MESH Interaction: Query, Processing, and Output'
summary: >-
  The MESH system processed a user query regarding 'the mesh', indicated by a 'undefined' answer and
  zero activated neurons. Subsequent MESH requests were truncated, and user actions included
  accepting a build command and checking its status, followed by a new embedding request.
insights:
  - The MESH system can receive and process user queries, even if initial responses are undefined.
  - System logs indicate MESH requests were truncated due to size limitations.
  - User interaction involved accepting a build command and performing status checks.
  - A new embedding request was initiated after the build command was accepted.
