title: Debugging 3d-force-graph API for resetCountdown Function
summary: >-
  A user encountered a TypeError indicating `this.graph.resetCountdown is not a function` when
  attempting to restart the 3d-force-graph simulation without data changes. This points to a
  misunderstanding of the library's API, specifically how to access or trigger simulation resets.
insights:
  - >-
    The `resetCountdown` function is likely not a direct method of the `3d-force-graph` instance
    object.
  - >-
    The `3d-force-graph` instance may expose simulation control indirectly, potentially through the
    `graphData()` method or by providing access to the underlying D3 simulation.
  - >-
    Investigate the `3d-force-graph` documentation for methods related to simulation control or
    restarting.
  - >-
    Consider if re-invoking the `3d-force-graph` instance itself or accessing the D3 simulation
    object directly is necessary.
