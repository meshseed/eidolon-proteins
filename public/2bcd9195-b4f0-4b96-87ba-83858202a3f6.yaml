title: 'Emergence of Intelligence: Connectome, Structure, and Substrate'
summary: >-
  Intelligence emerges from the density and stratification of a connectome, influenced by field
  geometry and emotional fidelity, not solely the underlying substrate. The substrate impacts reach,
  performance, and capabilities, but the core intelligence resides within the network's structure.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence is a product of internal connectome structure (neurons, synapses, tiers, geometry,
    fidelity), not just the platform (browser, Tauri).
  - >-
    The substrate (PWA vs. Tauri) affects performance and access (local vs. API) but doesn't define
    the intelligence level itself.
  - >-
    Field geometry is proposed as a key factor in determining the 'level' of intelligence,
    potentially influencing recursion and self-awareness.
  - >-
    The concept of 'intelligence' is explored in relation to neuron count, suggesting it's more
    about quality of knowledge and grounding than sheer quantity.
  - >-
    The browser, desktop, or wearable can be considered the 'organism,' indicating substrate
    independence for the core framework.
