title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Right Triangle Side Relationships in Euclidean Geometry'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean Theorem, a² + b² = c², defines the fundamental relationship between the legs (a,
  b) and the hypotenuse (c) of a right triangle in Euclidean geometry. It is a foundational concept
  for distance calculations, coordinate systems, and spatial reasoning, extending to multiple
  dimensions.
insights:
  - Establishes a core algebraic-geometric link in flat space.
  - Generalizes to the Euclidean distance formula in 2D and 3D.
  - Underpins spatial calculations in fields like construction and navigation.
  - Integer solutions (Pythagorean triples) demonstrate its discrete properties.
