title: 'Fractals: Self-Similarity and Infinite Complexity from Simple Rules'
summary: >-
  Fractals are geometric shapes exhibiting self-similarity across scales, where complex structures
  emerge from simple recursive definitions. Their key properties include infinite detail, fractional
  dimensions, and roughness at all zoom levels, mirroring patterns found in nature.
insights:
  - Self-similarity means parts of a fractal resemble the whole at different scales.
  - Infinite detail and complexity arise from simple, repeating mathematical rules.
  - Fractals possess fractional dimensions, a characteristic beyond Euclidean geometry.
  - Natural phenomena like coastlines and tree branches often display fractal properties.
  - The Mandelbrot set exemplifies the infinite intricacy achievable through recursive definitions.
