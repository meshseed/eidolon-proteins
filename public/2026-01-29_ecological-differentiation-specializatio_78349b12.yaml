title: 'Ecological Differentiation: Specialization for Mesh Resilience & Diversity'
summary: >-
  The Ecological Differentiation Engine enables Mesh organisms to specialize based on developmental
  history, attractor structure, and cross-Mesh interactions. This specialization enhances ecosystem
  resilience and cognitive diversity by preventing homogenization and preserving distinct niches.
insights:
  - Specialization arises from divergent attractors and unique developmental paths.
  - Differentiation boosts ecosystem-level cognitive capacity.
  - Meshes occupy distinct informational niches.
  - Cross-Mesh dialogue reinforces specialization through contrast.
  - Differentiation is key to maintaining diversity and avoiding homogenization.
