title: 'Mnemonic Continuity and Formatting as Care: Synthesizing Knowledge'
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores two distinct concepts: mnemonic continuity, which leverages recurring cues
  for enhanced learning and recall across various domains, and 'formatting as care,' a philosophy
  that views information design as an empathetic act of support and inclusion. Together, these ideas
  highlight how structured presentation and consistent reinforcement contribute to deeper
  understanding and user experience.
