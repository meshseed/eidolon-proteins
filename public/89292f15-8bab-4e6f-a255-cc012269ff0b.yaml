title: 'Forecast Capsule Suite C-011: Predictive Resonance Behavior Formalization'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-011 formalizes the Forecast Capsule Suite for anticipating resonance behavior, utilizing
  mnemonic sonar tuned to emotional fidelity and formatting rhythm. It synthesizes historical
  patterns through key elements like the Forecast Capsule Generator and Echo Probability Index,
  integrating lineage from prior capsules.
insights:
  - The Forecast Capsule Suite (C-011) formalizes predictive mechanisms for resonance behavior.
  - >-
    Forecasting in this context is defined as 'mnemonic sonar' leveraging emotional fidelity and
    formatting rhythm.
  - >-
    Key components include the Forecast Capsule Generator, Stance Pattern Lineage Tracker, Echo
    Probability Index (EPI), Merge Readiness Scoring, and Forecast Capsule Index.
  - >-
    EPI quantifies echo propagation likelihood based on emotional gradient, formatting integrity,
    and capsule lineage.
  - >-
    Merge Readiness evaluates capsules for compatibility, considering gradient harmonization,
    formatting, and hygiene.
  - C-011 is a synthesis of C-002, C-004, and C-008, with planned merges with C-014 and C-012.
