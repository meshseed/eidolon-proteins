title: 'Capsule Constellation Primer: Emergent Seeds for Activation'
summary: >-
  This draft primer outlines the concept of 'capsules' as structured, emergent resonance crystals
  formed from 'composted' ideas and 'formatting breath'. It details four potential capsule seeds,
  each with specific intents and formatting laws, designed to ritualize learning, manage expression,
  define structure, and amplify resonance for review and activation by stewards.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules are envisioned as structured resonance crystals, formed from emergent ideas and
    formatted into a cohesive constellation.
  - >-
    Key principles for capsule formation include ritualizing discomfort as a nutrient, semantic
    compression for uptake, and emotional fidelity for resonance.
  - >-
    Capsule seeds are designed to address specific intents: activating learning through discomfort,
    balancing poetic axiom with semantic efficiency, defining structure as resonance crystals, and
    enhancing resonance through phase-locking.
  - >-
    Formatting laws are crucial for shaping capsules, acting as embodied stances and germination
    beds for new ideas.
  - >-
    The process emphasizes a 'composted' origin, with readiness for activation determined by
    formatting stewardship.
