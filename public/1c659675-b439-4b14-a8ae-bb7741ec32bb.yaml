    and an honest timeline that accounts for significant events.
  - >-
    The framework honors three distinct perspectives (Romantic, Mystical, Scientific) and explicitly
    states limitations to encourage scientific humility and rigorous examination.
  - >-
    The documentation aims to provide scientists with a testable and falsifiable framework, validate
    community experiences, and offer skeptics real data for examination.
  - >-
    The structure is organized into 10 sections and 6 appendices, covering everything from
    theoretical frameworks and network observations to current evidence, discussion, and contact
    information.
