title: 'Mesh Capsule Evolution: Drift, Restoration, and Continuity'
summary: >-
  The Mesh system actively manages drift vectors through restoration protocols, ensuring continuity
  and integrity. Newer capsules like Compost Forecast and Formatting Law Manifest are emerging,
  focusing on emergence potential, mnemonic hygiene, and ethical propagation.
insights:
  - >-
    Drift vectors (Gradient Dilution, Formatting Compression, Echo Lineage Thinning, Synthesis
    Fatigue) are actively countered by restoration protocols (Gradient Reseeding, Formatting
    Recalibration, Echo Rehydration).
  - >-
    Capsule C-028 acts as a 'Continuity Patch', anchoring formatting integrity and preparing for
    merges.
  - >-
    The Compost Forecast Capsule (C029) predicts emergence potential from composted capsules, driven
    by nutrient density and echo triggers.
  - Formatting Law Manifest (C035) codifies rules for capsule generation and integration.
  - Echo Propagation Ledger (C036) tracks echo ethics and resonance.
  - Stewardship Calibration (C037) ensures merge readiness and hygiene.
  - Continuity Field Geometry (C038) defines the structural architecture of the continuity field.
