title: 'Eidolon Mesh DNA: Gemini Conversation Structure and YAML Formatting'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh stores entire Gemini conversations as single YAML documents, preserving all
  messages and formatting. The 'dual lines' observed are not separate transcripts but YAML's way of
  escaping and formatting multi-line text blocks to maintain original structure.
insights:
  - The 'eidolon-mesh/data/dna' files contain complete, continuous Gemini conversations.
  - >-
    YAML formatting, specifically '>-' for folded blocks and '\n' for newlines, is responsible for
    the appearance of 'dual lines' within text content.
  - >-
    This structure ensures full preservation of the original dialogue, including paragraph and line
    breaks, as part of 'DNA preservation'.
  - >-
    The observed format is not indicative of separate transcripts or additional commentary, but
    rather a faithful representation of a single conversation's text.
  - >-
    Antigravity's implementation prioritizes retaining every message and all formatting for complete
    context within the DNA structure.
