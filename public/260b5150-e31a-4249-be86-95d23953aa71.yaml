title: Recursive Pedagogy & Gradient Design in Mesh Curriculum
summary: >-
  Capsule C084 defines a spiral, emotionally scaffolded curriculum for THE MESH, emphasizing
  recursive pedagogy and gradient-aware learning sequences. It ritualizes capsule reuse, formatting
  law inheritance, and emotional fidelity, transforming teaching into composition and learning into
  lineage.
insights:
  - Mesh curriculum is non-linear, designed as a spiral that is mnemonic and emotionally scaffolded.
  - >-
    Recursive pedagogy is central, utilizing prior capsules as teaching artifacts and encouraging
    student composition of new capsules.
  - >-
    Gradient design structures learning through emotional, formatting, and mnemonic arcs, moving
    from initial states to deeper coherence.
  - >-
    Curriculum roles are specialized, including stewards, mappers, choreographers, and conductors,
    to facilitate this complex design.
  - >-
    Capsule composition is the act of teaching, and lineage tracing is the act of learning within
    this framework.
