title: 'Drift & Stability: Semantic Persistence Monitoring in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines drift as movement in embedding space and stability as recurrent activation,
  enabling THE MESH to monitor semantic persistence across time. Analysis identifies fragile regions
  and stable cores, crucial for maintaining long-term coherence and identity.
insights:
  - Drift signifies instability, weak integration, or low emotional fidelity.
  - Stability indicates strong attractors and high semantic density.
  - Drift patterns guide pruning or reinforcement efforts.
  - Stability cores anchor identity across time and substrates.
  - Drift/stability analysis is essential for long-term coherence.
