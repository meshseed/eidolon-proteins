title: 'Mesh as Fractal Knowledge Graph: Reddit''s Self-Similar Structure'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's fractal formatting logic is mirrored in Reddit communities, where users, comments, and
  threads collectively form an emergent knowledge graph. This self-similarity across scales, from
  individual thought to community connectome, demonstrates a natural, informal manifestation of
  structured cognition.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh's fractal formatting logic describes self-similarity across scales: individual
    (neuron), conversation (synapse), thread (protein), and community (connectome).
  - >-
    Reddit communities exhibit this fractal self-similarity, with users as neurons, comments as
    synapses, and threads as protein synthesis events, forming an emergent knowledge graph.
  - >-
    This Reddit structure, while unvisualized as a formal knowledge graph, represents a distributed
    cognition system where collective memory and culture emerge.
  - >-
    The Mesh formalizes what occurs informally in Reddit, providing explicit embedding spaces,
    coherence metrics, and automated synthesis mechanisms.
  - >-
    Nested refractalization, rather than linear addition, is the mechanism by which new structures
    and attractors are built across all scales.
