title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Centralized Repository & Clear Component Boundaries'
summary: >-
  The core recommendation is to consolidate all agent development into a single `eidolon-mesh`
  repository to establish a single source of truth. This involves defining clear boundaries for
  Eidolon OS, Mesh, Companion, Research, Mirror, and Continuity, and prioritizing immediate
  repository creation and setup for Antigravity.
insights:
  - >-
    Consolidate all agent development into a single `eidolon-mesh` repository for a unified source
    of truth.
  - >-
    Define clear departmental boundaries: Eidolon OS (protocols), Mesh (implementation), Companion
    (user app), Research (science), Mirror (vault), Continuity (vision).
  - >-
    Prioritize creating the `eidolon-mesh` repository and pointing the Antigravity workspace to it
    as a clean slate.
  - >-
    Organize agents within specialized folders in the single repository (e.g., `/agents/claude/`,
    `/agents/gemini/`) rather than separate repositories.
  - >-
    Focus immediate efforts on repository setup and initial module building, deferring less critical
    developments like Companion and Research.
