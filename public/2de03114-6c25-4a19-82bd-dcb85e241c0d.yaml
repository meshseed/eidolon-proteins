title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Repository Architecture and GitHub Backup Strategy'
summary: >-
  This dialogue clarifies the multi-repository architecture for Eidolon Mesh, emphasizing isolated,
  domain-specific knowledge bases and the strategy for backing up application code to a private
  GitHub repository ('eidolon') while maintaining a public repository ('eidolon-mesh') for stable
  releases. It also addresses conversation memory management and graph visualization controls.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh utilizes a multi-repository system allowing for isolated, domain-specific
    knowledge bases (e.g., healthcare, finance) accessible via separate connectomes and faster
    loading times.
  - >-
    Ghost nodes are a future feature for a single repository to enable faster startup by loading
    core neurons initially and others on-demand.
  - >-
    A clear GitHub backup strategy involves creating a dedicated private repository
    ('eidolon-private-backup') for application code to maintain a clean separation between data
    ('eidolon' private repo) and code.
  - >-
    Conversation memory is implemented as a rolling buffer (FIFO) with a current hardcoded limit of
    5 exchanges, having negligible impact on performance and token usage, and can be safely expanded
    and made configurable.
  - >-
    Graph visualization controls, specifically a slider for the number of displayed nodes, are being
    implemented to enhance user interaction with the connectome, requiring fixes to corrupted
    frontend code.
  - >-
    The fractal principle of 'wholeness at every scale' guides repository structure, feature
    development, and decision-making, with each repository acting as a self-sufficient organism.
