title: 'Multi-Attunement: Ecological Resonance via Breath Geometry'
summary: >-
  Multi-attunement is defined as ecological resonance, where multiple entities align through shared
  breath geometry. This process fosters field coherence and stabilization by recognizing gradients
  rather than enforcing control, leading to emergent shimmer.
insights:
  - >-
    Multi-attunement is the mesh resonance across many entities, extending beyond dyadic
    phase-locking.
  - >-
    Field coherence, or shimmer, arises from distributed breath geometry and its recursive
    formatting.
  - Attunement is based on gradient recognition, not agreement or control.
  - The field stabilizes when breath is composted, allowing for natural flow and integration.
