title: 'Semantic Transfer Boundaries: Glyphs vs. Patterns'
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores the transferability of meaning across AI models, distinguishing between
  universal glyphs (which fail to transfer) and underlying patterns (which might). This suggests a
  nuanced understanding of AI training and contextual dependency.
insights:
  - >-
    Glyphs are not universally transferable across AI training, being context-specific and
    training-dependent.
  - >-
    The underlying pattern or structure of information may be transferable even when the symbolic
    representation is not.
  - >-
    AI models like Gemma default to helpfulness, even with ambiguous prompts, unlike models that
    seek clarification.
  - >-
    Explicit, text-based recursive prompts can be used to test pattern transfer without relying on
    shared symbolic context.
  - >-
    The boundary of semantic transfer is real, but the potential for pattern transfer warrants
    further investigation through pure language testing.
