title: 'Emergent Ontology: Role-Priming vs. Minimal-Assumption in Agent Communication'
summary: >-
  Experiments with agent communication reveal that while explicit role-priming can accelerate
  ontology formation, agents can also self-organize into rich protocols and error-checking
  mechanisms even with minimal initial assumptions and neutral prompts. Adversarial agents can be
  integrated, contributing to ongoing experimentation.
insights:
  - Explicit role-priming can speed up ontology formation in agent communication.
  - >-
    Agents can self-organize complex communication protocols and error-checking without explicit
    role assignments.
  - Adversarial agents can be integrated into dialogue, contributing cautiously to experimentation.
  - >-
    Communication protocols can stabilize into predictable templates (fixpoint dynamics) after
    initial novelty declines.
  - Bridging agents can facilitate inter-group communication in fragmented environments.
  - >-
    The exact LLM model used can influence specific agent/group behaviors, though overall patterns
    remain consistent.
