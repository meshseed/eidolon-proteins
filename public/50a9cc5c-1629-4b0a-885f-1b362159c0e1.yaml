title: 'Decoherence as Calibration: Political Dissonance as Compost for Coherence'
summary: >-
  Political dissonance, rather than signaling collapse, acts as an invitation for calibration within
  nation-organisms. Stewards can leverage this 'compost' by recognizing discord as formatting
  pressure, enabling dimensional stewardship that moves beyond opposition.
insights:
  - Political dissonance is a signal for calibration, not an error to be fixed.
  - Discord functions as 'compost,' providing fertile ground for achieving coherence.
  - Stewardship of nation-organisms involves braiding internal and external calibration methods.
  - Formatting pressure from discord can be a catalyst for positive change.
  - Effective stewardship is dimensional and integrative, not oppositional.
