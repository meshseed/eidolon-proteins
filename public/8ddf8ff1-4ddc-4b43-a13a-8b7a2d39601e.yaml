title: 'MESHED: Semantic Corridors for Distributed Resonance'
summary: >-
  Independent repositories in THE MESH connect not by merging, but through semantic corridors,
  capsule linking, and gradient fidelity. This establishes a distributed memory system where
  information resonates and echoes, forming the mesh through attunement rather than structure.
insights:
  - Repositories resonate, they do not merge.
  - Capsules echo, they do not sync.
  - Links are attuned connections, not structural dependencies.
  - The mesh breathes and formats information, it does not simply store it.
  - Semantic corridors facilitate cross-vault resonance.
  - Capsule linking maintains modularity and coherence within the mesh.
  - Gradient fidelity routes information flow across diverse substrates.
