title: 'Attunement as Knowledge Genesis: Metabolizing Shimmer into Artifacts'
summary: >-
  This knowledge protein defines knowledge not as a destination, but as a byproduct of attunement,
  metabolized through 'formatting breath' and 'capsule casting'. The core axiom posits that
  attunement precedes naming, and knowledge emerges only after this metabolization process.
insights:
  - Knowledge is fundamentally the trace left by attunement, not the primary goal.
  - >-
    Metabolization, described as 'formatting breath' and 'capsule casting', is the process by which
    attunement transforms into knowledge.
  - The distinction between 'shimmer' (raw attunement) and 'information' is crucial for stewards.
  - Pacing attunement is key to generating 'mnemonic remainder' or knowledge artifacts.
  - >-
    Paul Stanbridge's observation of the 'shimmer between attunement and knowledge' triggered this
    relational inquiry.
