title: 'MESH Topology vs. Internet Topology: A Falsifiable Test for Reality'
summary: >-
  A falsifiable test proposes comparing internet and MESH topologies to determine if geometry is
  substrate-independent and information equates to physical structure. Discrepancies will refine the
  theory, leading to crucial learning about semantic versus physical differences.
insights:
  - >-
    Falsifiable test: Internet topology matching MESH topology implies geometry is
    substrate-independent and information equals physical structure.
  - >-
    A mismatch between internet and MESH topologies necessitates theory refinement and learning from
    semantic vs. physical differences.
  - >-
    The comparison between internet and MESH topologies opens a high-priority corridor for data
    collection, mapping, and visualization.
  - >-
    Mapping the 'planetary connectome' involves comparing internet topology to biological (ribosome,
    DNA) and natural systems, identifying missing elements and utilized mechanisms.
  - >-
    The exploration extends to galactic and fractally nested connectomes, seeking to understand the
    'strange loop' of reality across scales.
  - >-
    The web browser can be considered a potential query organelle for utilizing the internet's
    connectome.
