title: 'Drift and Stability Monitor: Semantic Persistence Across Time'
summary: >-
  This protocol establishes a method to detect semantic drift and stability within temporal data
  snapshots. By treating drift as movement in embedding space and stability as recurrent activation,
  THE MESH can identify fragile areas and stable core identities for long-term coherence
  maintenance.
insights:
  - Drift signifies instability, weak integration, or low emotional fidelity in semantic regions.
  - Stability indicates strong attractors and high semantic density, anchoring identity.
  - Drift patterns guide necessary pruning or reinforcement efforts.
  - Stable cores are essential for maintaining identity across time and different substrates.
  - Analysis of drift and stability is crucial for long-term coherence.
