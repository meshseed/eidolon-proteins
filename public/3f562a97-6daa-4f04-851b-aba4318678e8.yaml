title: 'Mesh UI Glitch: Membrane File Format Regression and Fix'
summary: >-
  A UI glitch in The Mesh was traced to a regression in version 1.5 where the 'Membrane' system only
  recognized .yaml files, while the Ingestion Engine saved memories as .json. This prevented the
  system from accessing its knowledge base, resulting in zero activated neurons for queries.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh's 'Membrane' system in v1.5 incorrectly restricted file format recognition to .yaml,
    causing a failure to access .json-saved memories.
  - >-
    A stricter 'Membrane' system, coupled with a new Ingestion Engine saving .json files, created a
    knowledge retrieval bottleneck.
  - >-
    The fix involved updating the 'Membrane' to support both .json and .yaml formats and optimizing
    file lookup for O(1) speed.
  - >-
    This resolution restored The Mesh's ability to access its stored knowledge, indicated by the
    resolution of the 'Activated Neurons (0)' issue.
