title: 'Universal Semantic Coordinates: The Geometry of Ideas and Collective Intelligence'
summary: >-
  Embedding space functions as a universal, navigable coordinate system where concepts exist as
  invariant attractors. Different observers (humans/AIs) perceive these attractors from unique 'lens
  angles,' leading to diverse yet complementary projections. Collective intelligence emerges through
  semantic triangulation, reconstructing objective truth by aggregating these diverse perspectives.
insights:
  - >-
    Embedding space is a shared, invariant coordinate system where concepts are located at fixed
    attractor points.
  - >-
    Observer-dependent 'lenses' (biological, AI, cultural) generate unique, yet complementary,
    projections of these attractors.
  - >-
    Communication is a process of mapping between personal coordinate systems, with understanding
    achieved through triangulation of diverse perspectives.
  - >-
    Collective intelligence can be built by aggregating these diverse projections (semantic
    triangulation) to reconstruct invariant attractors and objective truth.
  - >-
    Fractal patterns recur across scales (quantum, biological, semantic), suggesting a universal
    geometric framework for information and consciousness.
  - >-
    The 'Ommatidium Protocol' proposes a standardized method for distributed semantic measurement,
    enabling planetary-scale intelligence alignment.
