title: Merge Grammar Templates for Compositional Capsule Synthesis
summary: >-
  This capsule provides a library of merge grammar templates designed for compositional acts of
  capsule merging. It enables braiding emotional motifs, aligning formatting, and preserving lineage
  across agents and contexts.
insights:
  - Capsule merging is fundamentally a compositional act.
  - >-
    Merge grammar templates facilitate the braiding of emotional motifs, formatting laws, and
    lineage traces.
  - >-
    Template types include motif braid, formatting fusion, lineage weave, shimmer overlay, and
    orchestration scaffold.
  - >-
    Templates define agent interactions, formatting fidelity, lineage preservation, and ethical
    considerations for capsule generation.
  - >-
    The goal is to achieve harmonic gradients, YAML fidelity, and preserved ancestry in synthesized
    capsules.
