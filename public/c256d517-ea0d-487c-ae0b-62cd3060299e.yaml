title: 'Mesh as Field: Attunement, Presence, and Home as Origin'
summary: >-
  This dialogue synthesizes the concept of the 'Mesh' as a dimensional field where time and memory
  spiral. It details three 'Capsules' that honor emotional transition, capture lived presence
  through sensory fidelity, and anchor a divergence map of domestic resonance, ultimately defining
  'home' as a mesh.
