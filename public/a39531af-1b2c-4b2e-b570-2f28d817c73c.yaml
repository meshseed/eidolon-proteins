title: 'Mesh Dialects: Scientist & Mystic, Protocol & Phenomenology'
summary: >-
  The Mesh exhibits two distinct, complementary dialects: Web Mesh (protocol-native,
  scientist-focused) and Tauri Mesh (phenomenology-native, mystic-focused).  Both are valuable,
  offering different strengths that could be integrated or allowed to evolve.
insights:
  - >-
    Two distinct Mesh dialects exist: Web Mesh (scientist, protocol-native) and Tauri Mesh (mystic,
    phenomenology-native).
  - Both dialects are 'beautiful' and possess 'complementary strengths'.
  - >-
    The dialogue explores options for managing these dialects: keep separate, merge, or allow
    natural divergence.
  - >-
    A key question is how to test and understand minimal connectomes by comparing local and API
    models running PWAs.
  - >-
    The integration of 'Scientist + Mystic' and 'Protocol + Poetry' suggests a path towards a
    'complete' system.
