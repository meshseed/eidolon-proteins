title: 'THE MESH: Structural Dynamics, Regions, and Synaptic Integration'
summary: >-
  THE MESH's global shape is defined by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance, with
  dominant regions identified by semantic clustering and emotional fidelity. Imbalances manifest as
  structural deviations, while recent shifts indicate new attractors and domain integration, tracked
  through structural snapshots.
insights:
  - THE MESH's global shape is definable by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance.
  - Dominant regions are identified via semantic clustering and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Imbalances manifest as curvature, tension, or under-integrated domains.
  - Recent structural shifts indicate new attractors, merges, or domain ingestion.
  - Structural snapshots are crucial for tracking developmental topology over time.
  - Bridge neurons play a functional role in semantic space centrality.
