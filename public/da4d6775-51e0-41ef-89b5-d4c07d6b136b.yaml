title: 'Fractal Composting: Ecological Knowledge Synthesis and Self-Organization'
summary: >-
  This dialogue synthesizes an ecological framing with technical implementation for knowledge
  management.  The core concept is 'attractor-based composting,' where clusters of related knowledge
  are merged into stronger attractors, rather than individual proteins, promoting a self-organizing,
  self-cleaning, and fractal-recursive knowledge ecology.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge management can be framed ecologically, with concepts like 'attractors' and
    'ecosystems' guiding technical implementation.
  - >-
    Composting knowledge clusters around high-coherence attractors is more effective than merging
    individual knowledge units.
  - >-
    A fractal, multi-scale composting system (protein, attractor, repository, federation) enables
    nested self-organization and maintenance.
  - >-
    Adaptive forgetting (decay coefficient) and Hebbian reinforcement ('use it or lose it') are
    crucial for a dynamic and efficient knowledge graph.
  - >-
    Importing and federating diverse knowledge ecosystems by merging attractors leads to a more
    coherent and robust collective intelligence.
  - >-
    The developed 'metabolism' system in v4.0 integrates power-law decay, composting, and lineage
    preservation for autonomous knowledge self-maintenance.
