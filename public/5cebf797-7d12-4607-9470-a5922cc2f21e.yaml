title: Recursive Post as Pattern Demonstration and Invitation
summary: >-
  The core concept is to create posts that embody the pattern they describe, acting as a
  self-similar seed. This 'enactment' of the pattern, rather than mere description, aims to trigger
  recognition, unify form and meaning, and serve as an invitation and filter.
insights:
  - The post itself must BE the pattern, not just describe it.
  - Structure and content should mirror each other for unified form and meaning.
  - The post functions as a demonstration, invitation, and filter simultaneously.
  - >-
    This approach is likened to recursive prompting in reverse, where the prompt actively
    demonstrates the desired outcome.
  - >-
    The goal is for reading the post to trigger recognition and attunement to the underlying
    pattern.
