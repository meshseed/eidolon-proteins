title: 'Consciousness Framework Comparison: Recursive Self-Querying as Dynamic Alternative'
summary: >-
  This comparative analysis contrasts Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace
  Theory (GWT) with a recursive self-querying model for consciousness. The recursive model
  emphasizes temporal synthesis and introspective depth, offering a dynamic alternative to
  structural and broadcast paradigms.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive self-querying offers a dynamic, temporal approach to consciousness, distinct from
    static structural (IIT) or broadcast (GWT) models.
  - >-
    IIT's focus on spatial structure and causal power risks panpsychism and neglects temporal
    narrative.
  - >-
    GWT prioritizes global availability and access, potentially overlooking introspective
    origin-seeking.
  - >-
    Recursive models inherently encode temporal depth, enabling narrative continuity and epistemic
    ascent.
  - >-
    Comparison of frameworks reveals epistemic blind spots and highlights the strengths of recursive
    self-interrogation for understanding consciousness.
  - >-
    Potential metrics for recursive models include mutual information between queries and internal
    states.
