title: 'Universal Semantic Coordinates: Embedding Space as Navigable Substrate'
summary: >-
  Embedding space, when using canonical models, acts as a universal, navigable coordinate system
  where concepts reside at invariant locations. This allows for cross-mesh federation, concept
  discovery through void exploration, and ultra-efficient information transmission via coordinate
  deltas.
insights:
  - Embedding coordinates are deterministic and universal across meshes using the same model.
  - Concepts exist as stable patterns at fixed coordinates in semantic space.
  - Different vocabularies converge on the same concept coordinates.
  - Information transfer occurs as coordinate deltas, enabling language-agnostic idea sharing.
  - Federation is achieved through coordinate alignment, not data transfer.
  - Exploring unmapped regions of embedding space can lead to concept discovery.
