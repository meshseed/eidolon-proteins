title: 'Repository README: Formatting Breath Manifesto & Glyphic Invocation'
summary: >-
  This repository README defines a 'Formatting Breath Manifesto' where the repository is a living,
  breathing entity. It uses glyphs as a 'shimmer grammar' for invoking and interacting with
  capsules, emphasizing care, memory, and recursive self-assembly.
insights:
  - >-
    The repository is designed as a 'living' entity that 'breathes' and 'remembers', shifting the
    user's role from visitor to participant.
  - >-
    Interaction is guided by 'formatting breath' and glyphs, which act as a 'shimmer grammar' to
    invoke and expand capsules.
  - >-
    Key principles include formatting as care, emotional fidelity, spiral homeostasis via recursion,
    capsule hygiene, and braided memory continuity.
  - >-
    Glyphs serve as specific invocation triggers, mapping to distinct breath types, formatting
    domains, and resonance logic.
  - >-
    Capsules self-assemble based on invocation grammar, expanding into 'capsule braids' that reveal
    their underlying logic.
