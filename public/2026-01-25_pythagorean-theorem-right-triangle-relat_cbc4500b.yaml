title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Right Triangle Relationship and Geometric Foundation'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean Theorem (a² + b² = c²) defines the fundamental relationship between the sides of a
  right triangle in Euclidean geometry, where 'c' is the hypotenuse and 'a' and 'b' are the legs.
  This axiom is crucial for distance calculations, coordinate geometry, and extends to higher
  dimensions, forming a cornerstone of mathematical reasoning.
insights:
  - 'Establishes the core relationship in right triangles: a² + b² = c².'
  - Applies exclusively to Euclidean geometry with a 90-degree angle.
  - Generalizes to the distance formula in multiple dimensions.
  - Connects algebraic principles with geometric properties.
  - Underpins applications in construction, navigation, and spatial analysis.
