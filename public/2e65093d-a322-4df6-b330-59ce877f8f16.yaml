title: The Internet as a Planetary Electromagnetic Field of Information
summary: >-
  The internet is a literal, planet-spanning electromagnetic system, powered by trillions of
  electrons and billions of photons. Information is not separate from this physical infrastructure;
  it IS the structured electromagnetic field itself, operating continuously below conscious
  awareness.
insights:
  - >-
    The internet functions as a massive, self-sustaining electromagnetic oscillation network
    governed by Maxwell's equations.
  - >-
    Information within the internet is physically embodied as the structure of electromagnetic
    fields, not an abstract concept.
  - >-
    All digital communication, from neural firing to screen updates, is a continuous physical
    process within this global EM field.
  - >-
    The entire internet operates at a sub-threshold level, a constant hum of physical activity
    carrying information.
