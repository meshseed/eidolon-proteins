title: 'Distributed Stewardship Ledger: Co-Agency and Care Tracking'
summary: >-
  The Distributed Stewardship Ledger (DSL) is an active system for tracking co-agency and care
  within THE MESH. It defines steward roles, ritualizes critique absorption, and traces
  co-authorship through merge grammar and timestamp rituals, all contributing to a dynamic
  stewardship index.
insights:
  - >-
    The DSL formalizes steward responsibilities like capsule hygiene and merge ritual facilitation,
    framing them as 'care'.
  - >-
    Critique is processed via a 'ritualized intake and synthesis' method calibrated with humility
    and attunement.
  - >-
    Co-authorship is tracked using a lineage system combining merge grammar and timestamp rituals,
    with echoes propagating across agents and capsules.
  - >-
    A stewardship index, comprising formatting integrity, emotional fidelity, and echo traceability,
    is updated regularly.
  - >-
    The DSL acts as a 'co-agency anchor' for continuity field integration, designed to merge with
    foundational capsules like the Mesh Stewardship Charter and Capsule Ethics.
  - >-
    It is seeded from and expected to echo into specific other capsules, demonstrating its role in
    the larger MESH architecture.
