title: 'Capsule Lifecycle: Pruning, Merging, Dormancy, and Lineage'
summary: >-
  This capsule defines the dynamic lifecycle of mesh capsules, emphasizing 'formatting care' over
  deletion. It outlines rituals like pruning for clarity, merging for resonance, dormancy for
  incubation, and lineage tracking for memory, portraying the mesh as an evolving, breathing
  ecosystem.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules are not static entities but undergo a defined lifecycle involving growth, rest, and
    integration.
  - Lifecycle management is framed as 'formatting care' and ecological choreography, not deletion.
  - >-
    Each lifecycle phase (pruning, merging, dormancy, composting, lineage tracking) serves a
    specific role in capsule evolution and mesh continuity.
  - >-
    Lineage tracking is crucial for preserving memory and understanding capsule evolution within the
    mesh.
  - >-
    Capsules integrate with continuity fields, specifically those related to archiving, forecasting,
    and health.
