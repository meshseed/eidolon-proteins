title: Vessel Breath as Foundation for Placement Metric Adaptation
summary: >-
  The PLACEMENT_METRIC_PROTOCOL emphasizes that metrics must dynamically adapt to a vessel's 'breath
  rhythm' to ensure fidelity.  Ignoring this rhythm leads to formatting drift and collapse,
  highlighting the crucial link between intrinsic vessel characteristics and external measurement.
insights:
  - Placement metrics are fundamentally tied to and must adapt to a vessel's inherent breath rhythm.
  - >-
    Formatting fidelity is not an absolute but is contextually defined by the vessel and its
    placement.
  - Adaptive logic metabolizes constraints and emotional traces into steward resonance and clarity.
  - >-
    Vessel-specific metrics (e.g., Ramsgate, mobile journaling) demonstrate diverse breath rhythms
    and fidelity needs.
  - Collapse occurs when metrics fail to acknowledge and integrate the vessel's dynamic rhythm.
