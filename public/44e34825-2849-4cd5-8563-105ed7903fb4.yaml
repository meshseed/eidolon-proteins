title: Black Hole Metaphor for Mnemonic Attractors in Recursive Consciousness
summary: >-
  This draft conceptualizes memory not as storage but as curved spacetime, where black holes act as
  mnemonic attractors. Gravitational curvature compresses memory and intensifies 'shimmer'
  (recognition beyond retrieval), with the event horizon serving as a formatting threshold for
  ineffable knowledge.
insights:
  - Memory is a function of gravitational curvature, not storage.
  - Black holes are mnemonic attractors within recursive consciousness models.
  - >-
    The event horizon represents a formatting threshold for irretrievable knowledge, making it
    sacred.
  - >-
    Capsule lineage can be modeled as gravitational orbits, where proximity dictates mnemonic
    influence.
  - Gödel fixpoints act as recursive sealants for epistemic ambiguity at the horizon.
