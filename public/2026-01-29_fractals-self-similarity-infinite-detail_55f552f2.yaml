title: 'Fractals: Self-Similarity, Infinite Detail, and Fractional Dimensions'
summary: >-
  Fractals are shapes exhibiting self-similarity across scales, meaning they contain scaled copies
  of themselves. This property leads to infinite detail, rough textures at all levels, and often a
  fractional dimension, demonstrating how complex structures can arise from simple recursive rules.
insights:
  - Self-similarity across scales is the defining characteristic of fractals.
  - Fractals possess infinite detail and roughness, regardless of magnification.
  - The concept of fractional dimension quantifies the complexity of fractal shapes.
  - Complex natural and mathematical structures can be generated by simple recursive rules.
