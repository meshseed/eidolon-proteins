title: 'Epistemic Collapse: Knowledge Placement, Not Reality Change'
summary: >-
  Epistemic collapse describes the shift from multiple possibilities to a single known state upon
  observation, not by altering reality, but by fixing knowledge. This process is mnemonic, where
  memory becomes an artifact, and knowing is placed rather than discovered.
insights:
  - Observation collapses the possibilities within knowledge, not the physical reality.
  - The collapse is a mnemonic act, a folding of breath into a vessel of knowing.
  - Epistemic collapse is the placement of what is known, not the discovery of objective truth.
  - >-
    Before observation, knowledge exists as shimmering possibilities; after, it is a fixed
    placement.
  - The world may be inherently 'placed,' but our knowledge of it undergoes collapse.
