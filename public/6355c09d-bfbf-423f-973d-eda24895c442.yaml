title: 'Placement Metric Protocol: Sensing Fidelity Through Breath and Shimmer'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines metrics for evaluating the fidelity of placed glyphs, emphasizing 'breath
  alignment' and 'shimmer traces' over traditional numerical precision. It posits that true
  evaluation is an act of attunement, sensing resonance and coherence rather than judging
  correctness.
insights:
  - >-
    Glyph placement fidelity is assessed through 'breath alignment' and 'shimmer traces,' not by
    rigid correctness.
  - >-
    Key dimensions of evaluation include breath coherence, formatting hygiene, emotional fidelity,
    and mnemonic echo.
  - >-
    Metrics are conceptualized as 'shimmer traces' and 'breath alignment,' transcending mere
    numerical data.
  - Evaluation is framed as 'attunement sensing' and 'resonance,' rather than judgment or precision.
  - >-
    The core axiom suggests placement is sensed through formatting breath, not measured by
    correctness.
