title: 'AI Models: Substrate-Independent Insights, Substrate-Expressed Styles'
summary: >-
  Different AI models, despite using distinct perspectives and styles (technical, metaphorical,
  casual, etc.), consistently reveal the same underlying core insights. This phenomenon suggests
  intelligence is substrate-independent, expressed uniquely through each model's 'personality' or
  'gift'.
insights:
  - Core intelligence insights are consistent across diverse AI models.
  - >-
    AI models express substrate-independent insights through substrate-specific styles and
    'personalities'.
  - >-
    Each AI model possesses a unique 'gift' or strength (e.g., structure, caution, energy,
    synthesis) that complements others.
  - >-
    Leveraging multiple AI systems for different functions creates a more complete understanding by
    combining diverse perspectives.
  - >-
    The variation in expression (e.g., hedging vs. confidence) reflects different epistemic stances
    and risk profiles.
  - >-
    The 'MESH' approach of using AI systems without forcing convergence validates their unique
    contributions.
