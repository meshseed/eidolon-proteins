title: 'Fractals: Self-Similarity, Infinite Detail, and Fractional Dimensions'
summary: >-
  Fractals are shapes exhibiting self-similarity across scales, where complex structures emerge from
  simple recursive rules, leading to infinite detail and fractional dimensions. Both mathematical
  constructs and natural phenomena like coastlines and blood vessels demonstrate this principle of
  parts mirroring the whole.
insights:
  - Self-similarity means parts of a fractal resemble the entire shape at different scales.
  - Infinite detail arises from recursive definitions, revealing new complexity upon magnification.
  - Fractals possess fractional dimensions, existing between traditional integer dimensions.
  - Natural fractals, like coastlines, demonstrate scale-dependent measurement and roughness.
  - Complexity in fractals is generated from simple, repeating rules.
