title: 'Symmetry Groups: Transformations, Axioms, and Geometric Essence'
summary: >-
  Symmetry describes transformations that preserve an object's form, forming groups under
  composition with four defining axioms. These groups, exemplified by geometric shapes and their
  symmetries, reveal fundamental structures across science and art.
insights:
  - Symmetry is invariance under transformation.
  - Symmetries form mathematical groups governed by closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.
  - Basic transformations include reflection, rotation, and translation.
  - Group structure encapsulates all possible symmetries of an object.
  - Symmetry is a fundamental concept with broad applications in science, art, and design.
