title: Query-Triggered Wave Propagation for Semantic Resonance Visualization
summary: >-
  Implemented a query-triggered wave propagation system where query responses materialize as
  standing waves. Similarity scores are mapped to wave amplitude, visualizing semantic antinodes
  through constructive interference, revealing insights into wave timing, performance constraints,
  and Chladni patterns.
insights:
  - Query-triggered wave propagation models the emergence of answers as materialized waves.
  - >-
    Similarity scores directly correlate to wave amplitude, enabling visualization of semantic
    resonance.
  - >-
    The system naturally teaches wave timing, performance constraints (activated subgraph), and
    antinode clustering (Chladni patterns).
  - >-
    Standing wave phenomena emerge from understanding query behavior first, providing a parameter
    space for continuous oscillation.
  - >-
    Wave visualization enhances understanding of query activation and semantic relationships within
    the MESH.
