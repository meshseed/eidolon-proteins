title: Optimizing Eidolon Mesh Performance and Addressing Antigravity Bugs
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines recommendations for optimizing the Eidolon Mesh by switching to
  percentage-based loading with a two-tier approach, and identifies critical bugs in Antigravity
  related to timer inaccuracy, synthesis input, and missing time breakdowns, alongside requests for
  progress indicators.
insights:
  - >-
    Implement a two-tier loading strategy for the Eidolon Mesh, starting with a 25% core load and
    offering a 'Deep Search' for extended content, utilizing percentages instead of fixed numbers
    for scalability and performance.
  - >-
    Address critical Antigravity bugs including timer inaccuracy by moving the timer start to the
    request handler's first line, fixing synthesis input by ensuring full protein content is passed,
    and adding timestamp logging for stage breakdown.
  - >-
    Enhance user experience by implementing progress indicators via Server-Sent Events to provide
    feedback during the ~60s loading period.
  - >-
    Empirically optimize load times and query quality by measuring performance against varying
    percentage loads and identifying 'sweet spots'.
  - >-
    Introduce configurable user controls, such as sliders, to manage loading percentages and other
    performance aspects.
