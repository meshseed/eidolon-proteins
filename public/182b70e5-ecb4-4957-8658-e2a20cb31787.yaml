title: 'Topology Forecasting: Predictive Modeling of Future Structural States'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables THE MESH to predict future topological configurations by analyzing current
  structural dynamics. Forecasts are directional tendencies, guiding proactive stabilization and
  developmental steering.
insights:
  - Topology evolves along density, resonance, and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Strengthening bridges indicate future integration between distant regions.
  - Drift vectors predict future pruning or reinforcement areas.
  - Attractor pressure reveals likely locations for new cluster formation.
  - Forecasting supports proactive stabilization and developmental steering.
