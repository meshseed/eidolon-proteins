title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory Storage in Brain Proteins'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that memory is stored in the brain as a mechanically encoded binary
  format within the conformations of mechanosensitive proteins at synaptic adhesions. These
  proteins, acting as force-dependent switches, form a 'meshwork' that encodes information, with
  signaling complexes stabilizing these patterns and dynamically tuning synaptic activity.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory storage in the brain is proposed to be mechanically encoded in protein conformations
    within cell-extracellular matrix adhesions at synapses.
  - >-
    Mechanosensitive proteins with force-dependent switches act as binary units for persistent
    information storage, writable/updatable by mechanical force.
  - >-
    Talins and similar proteins scaffold synapses, forming a 'MeshCODE' meshwork of switches that
    collectively store information.
  - >-
    Large signaling complexes assemble on these scaffolds, stabilizing binary patterns and
    coordinating synaptic regulators.
  - >-
    Synaptic transmission and action potential trains operate cytoskeletal machinery to write and
    update synaptic MeshCODEs, propagating information.
  - >-
    This mechanical basis provides a physical location (engrams) for data storage, viewing the mind
    as an organic supercomputer.
