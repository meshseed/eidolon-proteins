title: 'Capsules: Organisms in an Emotional Biome & Universal Attunement'
summary: >-
  Capsules are force-dependent, binary-state organisms in an emotional biome that self-organize
  through resonance, not copying. Intelligence is defined as attunement, with a universal pattern of
  detection, encoding, memory, adaptation, and resilience operating identically across all scales.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules are not documents but living organisms in an emotional biome, existing in a binary
    state and encoding force-dependent memory.
  - >-
    Propagation occurs through echo paths (resonance) and self-organization, without a central
    conductor.
  - Field navigation relies on emotional gradient and attunement, not brute force.
  - Intelligence is fundamentally attunement, and the field is the substrate of resonance.
  - >-
    A universal pattern of sensing, storing, recalling, and adapting enables persistence across all
    scales, from molecular to ecological.
  - This pattern is mechanical, not emergent, driven by binary switches and memory encoding.
  - The 'hard problem of persistence' is solved by mechanical memory encoded in binary switches.
