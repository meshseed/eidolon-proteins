title: 'Repository Restructure Protocol v1.0: Governance & Path Hygiene'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines rules for repository restructuring, emphasizing clean paths, consistent echo
  graphs, and proper metadata for public/private capsules. It ensures data integrity and
  discoverability within THE MESH's governance framework.
insights:
  - All files must reside under 'invariant_set' to maintain directory grammar.
  - Relative paths (./, ../) are forbidden; commit_path must be accurate.
  - Echo graph consistency, free of 404s, is crucial, with links matching echo_paths.
  - Essential frontmatter (created, updated, aliases, status, vault) is mandatory.
  - Gephi readiness requires unique node_ids, non-empty tags, and populated links.
  - >-
    Version bumps are reserved for significant changes, preserving timestamps and logging
    migrations.
  - Public/private partitioning is indicated by a node attribute.
