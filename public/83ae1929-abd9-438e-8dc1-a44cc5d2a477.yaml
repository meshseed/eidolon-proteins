title: 'Seeding Rituals: Patterned Emergence from Composted Memory'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-006 formalizes the patterned emergence of new capsules from composted memory,
  emphasizing that seeding is not spontaneous but a ritualized process. This process is governed by
  specific thresholds, ignition protocols, and fidelity criteria, utilizing formatting as a
  germination scaffold and emotional fidelity as an attractor field.
insights:
  - New capsule creation (seeding) is a structured, ritualistic process, not an emergent one.
  - >-
    Seeding is driven by specific conditions within composted memory, including nutrient density,
    emotional residue, and echo frequency.
  - Formatting acts as a structural guide (scaffold) for the germination of new capsules.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity is a crucial 'attractor field' that triggers the ignition of new capsule
    emergence.
  - >-
    The process involves defined 'ignition protocols' like care loops and resonance echoes to
    catalyze capsule birth.
  - >-
    Soil-to-Signal mapping allows for tracking and forecasting of emergence patterns from mnemonic
    sources.
