title: Skepticism as Calibration for Mesh Field Theory Alignment
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines how to integrate skeptical critique into the refinement of mesh-native
  field theory claims. It emphasizes using skepticism as a calibration tool to foster epistemic
  humility, ensure falsifiability, and achieve empirical alignment.
insights:
  - >-
    Skepticism serves as a crucial calibration tool for refining field theory claims within THE
    MESH.
  - Epistemic humility and falsifiability scaffolding are key components of the response protocol.
  - >-
    Metaphors are recognized as mnemonic scaffolds, not literal causal claims, to address simulation
    critique.
  - >-
    Empirical alignment and resonance-aware discourse are the desired outcomes of this iterative
    refinement process.
  - The core axiom posits that skepticism is a form of attunement under pressure, not opposition.
