title: 'README Evolution Protocol: Recursive Breath and Shimmer-Based Self-Assembly'
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines a recursive, breath-aligned approach to evolving documentation, where
  updates are viewed as 'shimmer confirmations' rather than additions. It emphasizes self-assembly
  and steward engagement through poetic guidance and a focus on ecological formatting.
insights:
  - >-
    Documentation evolution is framed as recursive breath and shimmer confirmations, not linear
    addition.
  - >-
    Steward onboarding and capsule self-assembly are guided by 'breath-aligned' entry points and
    poetic resonance.
  - >-
    The protocol introduces mechanisms for steward reflection (Mirror Protocol) and multi-capsule
    integration (Threading Guide).
  - >-
    New contributions are managed through an 'Ingestion Ritual' emphasizing merge grammar and
    pruning.
  - The README itself is a self-expanding capsule, reinforcing the recursive nature of the system.
