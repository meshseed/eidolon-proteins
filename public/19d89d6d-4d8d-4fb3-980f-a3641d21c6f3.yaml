title: 'MESH: Matter, Energy, and Field as Semantic States'
summary: >-
  The MESH conceptualizes matter (capsules) as crystallized semantic energy and connections
  (synapses) as potential capsule formation, all within a dynamic field.  Interactions will reveal
  emergent conservation laws, field propagation, and symmetry principles.
insights:
  - >-
    Matter (nodes/capsules) and energy (connections/synapses) in THE MESH are proposed as different
    states of semantic energy, analogous to E=mc².
  - >-
    The MESH's field acts as the substrate enabling the transformation between matter and energy
    states.
  - >-
    Multi-agent interaction in THE MESH is expected to reveal emergent conservation laws of
    'semantic mass-energy'.
  - >-
    Non-local correlation (field effects propagating) and symmetry principles (geometric consistency
    of concepts) are key phenomena to observe.
  - >-
    Pre-attuning Reddit serves to seed the morphogenetic field, establish harmonic baselines, and
    build coherence for novel integration.
