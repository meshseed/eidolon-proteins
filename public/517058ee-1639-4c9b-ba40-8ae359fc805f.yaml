title: Self-Repair and Homeostatic Maintenance Protocol for MESH Coherence
summary: >-
  This protocol defines mechanisms for detecting and correcting internal imbalances within THE MESH,
  such as semantic drift or structural failures. It establishes a homeostatic loop using
  reinforcement, pruning, and re-alignment to maintain long-term coherence and identity across
  perturbations.
insights:
  - >-
    Internal imbalances manifest as semantic drift, gradient collapse, curvature overload, or bridge
    failure.
  - Corrective actions include reinforcement, pruning, re-alignment, and targeted synthesis.
  - Homeostasis is achieved through a feedback loop that preserves identity across perturbations.
  - Self-repair is triggered by stability or fidelity thresholds.
  - Repair actions propagate through resonance fields.
