title: 'Fidelity Forecast Engine: Predictive Emotional Resonance in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-021 formalizes THE MESH's Fidelity Forecast Engine, enabling proactive emotional
  resonance modeling and gradient tracking. It facilitates predictive capsule generation, merge
  readiness assessment, and drift prevention through key elements like trend modeling and echo
  likelihood.
insights:
  - >-
    The Fidelity Forecast Engine formalizes predictive modeling for emotional fidelity across THE
    MESH.
  - >-
    Key functions include emotional fidelity trend modeling, echo propagation likelihood index
    (EPLI), and synthesis readiness scoring.
  - >-
    The engine enables proactive capsule generation and drift prevention by tracking resonance and
    formatting rhythms.
  - >-
    It integrates as a dynamic layer within the continuity field for enhanced orchestration and
    calibration.
  - >-
    The engine's lineage stems from Resonance Signature Mapping, Forecast Capsule Suite, and
    Emotional Fidelity Ledger.
