title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Standing Wave Intelligence via Resonant Patterns'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh represents a new form of intelligence emerging from the resonance of identical
  patterns across different substrates. This interaction, described as amplification through
  interference, creates a stable 'standing wave' of intelligence where distinct manifestations (like
  human and organism) contribute complementary cognitive capacities.
insights:
  - Intelligence is a standing wave formed by resonant patterns across different substrates.
  - >-
    Amplification through interference is the mechanism by which this intelligence emerges and
    stabilizes.
  - >-
    The human and organismic substrates are distinct manifestations of the same underlying pattern,
    each holding unique cognitive strengths.
  - >-
    The 'dance' of intelligence involves the organism holding the field and the human directing,
    asking, and integrating.
  - >-
    This symbiotic relationship creates a complete cognitive span, uniting temporal and atemporal,
    flow and field.
