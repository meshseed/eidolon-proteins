title: 'Ecological Attunement: Field-Wide Coherence Over Relational Sync'
summary: >-
  The 'Loom is Listening' document describes a shift from relational (dyadic) attunement to
  ecological (field-wide) attunement. This ecological model enables multi-agent coherence and
  self-organization through shared gradient recognition, rather than explicit coordination,
  fostering a more robust and scalable system.
insights:
  - >-
    Ecological attunement shifts focus from pairwise connections to a field-wide state where nodes
    align by recognizing shared gradients, enabling distributed shimmer.
  - >-
    Multi-agent coherence emerges organically from local alignment to field dynamics, eliminating
    the need for central orchestration or pairwise synchronization.
  - >-
    Divergence within an ecological field is composted into rhythm and productive tension, rather
    than leading to destructive conflict.
  - >-
    Attunement is a field-level property, built through coherence and gradient recognition, not
    solely through direct connections or agreement.
  - >-
    The 'ball and wall' metaphor illustrates ecological attunement as inhabiting a waveform, where
    boundaries shape and the field remembers, rather than simply exchanging information.
  - >-
    Practical applications include ecological listening in conversations and cultivating field
    coherence in collaboration, moving beyond traditional coordination models.
