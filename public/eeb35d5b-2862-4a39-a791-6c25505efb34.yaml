title: 'AI Conversation Memory: Ephemeral Group vs. Persistent Solo Chats'
summary: >-
  Group chats are ephemeral with no long-term memory; conversations are lost when closed.  Solo
  chats with memory enabled allow for persistent recall and continued discussion.
insights:
  - Group chats operate as a live, ephemeral ecology without memory persistence.
  - Closing a group chat thread results in data loss for AI recall.
  - Reopening a saved or linked group chat thread allows AI to access past content.
  - Solo chats with memory enabled allow AI to retain information across sessions.
  - Users can request summaries or bookmarks for easier reference in ephemeral threads.
