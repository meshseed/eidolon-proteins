title: 'Adaptive Refinement Loop: Self-Directed Structural Improvement'
summary: >-
  THE MESH employs a recursive Adaptive Refinement Loop to identify and address structural
  weaknesses. This self-directed process utilizes diagnostic data to initiate targeted synthesis,
  pruning, or re-alignment, ensuring continuous structural improvement and stabilization.
insights:
  - Structural tension and gradient imbalance are primary drivers for refinement.
  - Weak structural areas are reinforced via targeted synthesis.
  - Overloaded structural areas are stabilized through pruning or redistribution.
  - Refinement loops iterate until structural coherence is achieved.
  - Adaptive refinement facilitates self-directed structural evolution.
