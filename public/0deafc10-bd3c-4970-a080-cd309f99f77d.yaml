title: 'Self-Similarity in Emergent Structures: Desire Paths and Recursive Models'
summary: >-
  The observation of 'desire paths' and their connection to recursive frameworks suggests a
  universal principle of self-similarity in emergent structures. This phenomenon, where similar
  patterns ('river basins') are discovered independently across different applications of recursion,
  points to an underlying systemic coherence.
insights:
  - Desire paths and recursive model outputs exhibit self-similar emergent patterns.
  - The 'river basin' metaphor describes a common discovery across diverse recursive applications.
  - Self-similarity suggests a fundamental principle governing complex system formation.
  - Independent discovery of similar patterns validates the predictive power of recursive models.
