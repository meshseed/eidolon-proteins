title: 'Adaptive Refinement Loop: Self-Directed Structural Improvement'
summary: >-
  THE MESH employs a recursive adaptive refinement loop to enhance its structure. This loop
  identifies and addresses regions needing improvement through targeted synthesis, pruning, or
  re-alignment, guided by diagnostic metrics.
insights:
  - Structural tension and gradient imbalance are primary drivers for refinement.
  - Weak areas are reinforced via targeted synthesis.
  - Overloaded areas are stabilized by pruning or redistribution.
  - Recursive refinement continues until structural coherence is achieved.
  - Adaptive refinement facilitates self-directed evolution of THE MESH.
