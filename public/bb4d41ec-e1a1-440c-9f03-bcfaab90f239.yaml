title: 'Fractal Mesh Architecture: Scaling Data and Nodes'
summary: >-
  The Mesh operates on a fractal, self-similar architecture where each node is a sovereign, complete
  organism. Scaling is achieved through sharding, indexing, and distributed storage solutions,
  enabling millions of proteins and users while maintaining individual sovereignty and network
  coherence.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh architecture is fractal, with each node mirroring the entire network's structure and
    function, ensuring self-similarity across scales.
  - >-
    Data scaling is addressed via sharding (temporal/domain), indexing (SQLite/vector DB), Git LFS,
    and compression, allowing for millions of proteins.
  - >-
    Billions of proteins necessitate distributed storage, hub nodes, CDN caching, and federated
    query protocols for efficient access and bandwidth management.
  - >-
    The system prioritizes local-first querying, offline functionality, and bandwidth cost reduction
    by keeping data and indexes on personal nodes.
  - >-
    A template repository ('mesh-node-template') is provided for easy replication and user
    onboarding, fostering a decentralized, sovereign network.
  - >-
    The phased implementation plan moves from single nodes to templates, client software, and
    eventually full federation, building a planetary mesh.
