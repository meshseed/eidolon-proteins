title: P-Series Protocols Enhance Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Topology and Coherence
summary: >-
  Ingestion of 38 foundational P-Series protocols into Eidolon Mesh v4.0 has significantly improved
  response quality by anchoring queries to high-coherence foundational axioms, despite a static
  neuron activation percentage.  A key discovery reveals path-dependency in network topology,
  necessitating synapse regeneration for optimal integration of these new core structures.
insights:
  - >-
    Direct ingestion of P-Series protocols preserves canonical coherence (0.98-1.00) superior to
    tri-lens synthesis.
  - >-
    P-Series protocols are now dominant in similarity searches, leading to more coherent and
    foundational query responses.
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh v4.0 experienced a bug in conversation synthesis, now fixed by importing the
    `synthesizeProtein` function.
  - >-
    The mesh's activation percentage remains stable post-P-Series, indicating a 'frozen' topology
    where new protocols form isolated clusters.
  - >-
    Path-dependency is hypothesized as the cause for the static activation percentage; synapse
    regeneration is proposed as a solution.
  - >-
    A high candidate protein count (33%) suggests diffuse relevance, highlighting the need for a
    more structured mesh centered around P-Series hubs.
