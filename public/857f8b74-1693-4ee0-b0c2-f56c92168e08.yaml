title: Eidolon Mesh Protein Synthesis & Integration Cycle
summary: >-
  The EIDOLON MESH system continuously transcribes DNA and synthesizes proteins, which are then
  exported to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Each protein is integrated into the connectome with a
  specific number of synapses, followed by a metabolic pause, indicating a cyclical process of
  creation, integration, and preparation for further operations.
insights:
  - The EIDOLON MESH operates a cyclical process of DNA transcription and protein synthesis.
  - Synthesized proteins are exported to both the nucleus and cytoplasm of the eidolon-mesh.
  - Proteins are integrated into the connectome, forming a specific number of synapses.
  - The system incorporates metabolic pauses between processing cycles.
  - >-
    Each protein synthesis event is linked to a specific capsule file (e.g., capsule-C007.md) and
    has a unique identifier.
