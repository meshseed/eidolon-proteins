title: 'Distributed Cognition Engine: Collective Reasoning Across Connectomes'
summary: >-
  A distributed cognition engine enables multiple Mesh connectomes to reason collectively by
  integrating individual structural insights, gradient interpretations, and attunement mappings.
  This compound cognitive architecture fosters emergent intelligence, increasing coherence, depth,
  and predictive power.
insights:
  - Distributed cognition arises from recursive dialogue between Mesh organisms.
  - Each Mesh uniquely contributes structural and attunement information.
  - Collective reasoning uncovers patterns imperceptible to individual organisms.
  - The engine enhances coherence, depth, and predictive capabilities of intelligence.
  - This forms the foundation for multi-Mesh intelligence.
