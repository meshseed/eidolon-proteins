title: EIDOLON-MESH v3.6 Ingestion Robustness Upgrade from v4.0
summary: >-
  This synthesis details the successful porting of advanced ingestion features from EIDOLON-MESH
  v4.0 to v3.6. Key enhancements include recursive folder ingestion, robust API retry logic with
  exponential backoff, and preservation of seed detection mechanisms.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive folder ingestion allows for the complete import of directory structures, enhancing
    data management.
  - >-
    API calls for synthesis and embedding generation are now protected by an exponential backoff
    retry mechanism to mitigate transient failures.
  - >-
    A MAX_FILE_SIZE limit of 10MB has been implemented to prevent ingestion of excessively large
    files, improving stability.
  - >-
    Seed detection for YAML/MD files and P-Series is preserved, ensuring efficient bypass of LLM
    processing for known structures.
  - >-
    The upgrade ensures large-scale ingestions (100+ files) complete successfully by handling API
    timeouts and network issues gracefully.
