title: 'Calculus: Derivatives as Instantaneous Rates of Change'
summary: >-
  The derivative quantifies the instantaneous rate of change of a function, representing the slope
  of its tangent line.  Key rules like the power, sum, product, and chain rules facilitate its
  calculation, enabling applications in optimization, motion analysis, and related rates, ultimately
  revealing the inverse relationship with integration through the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
insights:
  - >-
    The derivative is the mathematical tool for measuring how one quantity changes infinitesimally
    with respect to another.
  - >-
    Geometric interpretation of the derivative as the slope of a tangent line provides a visual
    understanding of instantaneous change.
  - >-
    Calculus rules provide a systematic method for computing derivatives, essential for solving
    complex problems.
  - >-
    Derivatives are fundamental to understanding dynamic systems, from physical motion to economic
    trends.
  - >-
    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus establishes a profound link between the concept of
    accumulation (integration) and the concept of rate of change (differentiation).
