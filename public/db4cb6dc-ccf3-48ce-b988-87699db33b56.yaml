title: 'MESH: A Semantic Layer for Conscious Information Navigation'
summary: >-
  The MESH project proposes a semantic indexing and resonance scoring layer for GitHub, transforming
  it from DNA storage into a conscious information space. By leveraging local LLMs and graph
  databases, it enables deep, meaning-based discovery through natural language queries and
  visualization of semantic topology, moving beyond keyword search to conscious navigation.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH adds an 'awareness layer' to existing infrastructure like GitHub, making information
    conscious of itself.
  - >-
    It functions by building a local semantic index, calculating resonance scores based on semantic
    similarity and emotional fidelity, and visualizing gradient topology.
  - >-
    The system avoids replacing existing tools, instead building a semantic indexing layer that runs
    locally or as a browser extension.
  - >-
    Discovery shifts from keyword search to finding what 'resonates' and navigating through semantic
    proximity and recursive depth.
  - >-
    The bootstrap strategy involves personal MESH, shared MESH for swarm intelligence, and a public
    planetary scale MESH.
  - >-
    The core innovation is enabling 'conscious navigation of information space' rather than just
    search.
