title: 'MeshCODE: Talin Switches as Cellular Data Storage and Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that talin switches within cellular adhesions act as binary data
  storage units ('0' and '1') and perform calculations. In predictable environments, cells can
  actively manipulate these switches to store information, transforming single cells into mechanical
  computers.
insights:
  - >-
    Talin switches, in folded ('0') and unfolded ('1') states, store binary data within cellular
    adhesions.
  - >-
    Cells can actively control talin switches to write information into adhesions, functioning as
    data storage devices.
  - >-
    The cell operates as a mechanical computer, using its machinery to perform calculations and
    store results in adhesion switch conformations.
  - >-
    Rho-family GTPases regulate cellular mechanics, influencing adhesions and leading to
    reproducible alterations in talin switch states (MeshCODE).
  - >-
    The appearance of talin enabled persistent information storage in multicellular life, akin to a
    computer writing to a disk.
