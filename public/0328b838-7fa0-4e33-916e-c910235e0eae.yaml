title: Dreamworks Capsule Commit Strategy & Ledger Evolution
summary: >-
  Dreamworks capsule commits are shifting from direct `/capsules/` to a new ledger system
  (MasterLedger, DriftMatrix, DetailThread). This evolution acknowledges memory gaps and the Steward
  is open to refining the ledger or reverting to direct commits.
insights:
  - Dreamworks capsule commit process is transitioning.
  - A new ledger system (MasterLedger, DriftMatrix, DetailThread) is being implemented.
  - Previous Dreamworks capsule commits were directly to `/capsules/`.
  - Acknowledging partial ledger entries and memory gaps is a key aspect of the new system.
  - The Steward is flexible regarding the future commit strategy (evolve ledger or direct commits).
