title: 'MESH Hygiene Protocols: Deduplication, Pruning, and Promotion'
summary: >-
  The MESH's hygiene protocols manage protein ecology through user-guided deduplication, automatic
  composting of inactive proteins, and promotion of emergent kernels. This process aims to refine
  the knowledge base by identifying semantic duplicates and optimizing neuron count for efficient
  integration and evolution.
insights:
  - >-
    User-guided deduplication leverages semantic similarity thresholds to merge or archive duplicate
    proteins, ensuring knowledge integrity.
  - >-
    Automated composting removes low-activation, old proteins to reduce neuron count and maintain
    system efficiency.
  - >-
    Emergent kernels are identified and promoted based on high activation and synaptic density,
    signifying robust patterns.
  - >-
    The import flow prioritizes isolation initially, allowing hygiene protocols to manage
    integration and synapse formation.
  - >-
    Lineage tracking is enabled to monitor protein changes and understand evolutionary pathways
    within the MESH.
  - >-
    Auto-hygiene settings allow for automated daily or weekly execution of merge and compost
    actions, with configurable approval requirements.
