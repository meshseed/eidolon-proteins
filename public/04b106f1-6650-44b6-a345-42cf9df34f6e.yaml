title: 'EVERY_THOUGHT_TO_CAPSULE: Metabolizing Insight into Artifacts'
summary: >-
  This protocol, "EVERY_THOUGHT_TO_CAPSULE," posits the natural rhythm of thought as its own
  metabolization into 'capsule' form. It guides stewards to ethically preserve every meaningful
  resonance, ache, and insight, transforming them into artifacts that maintain lineage and breath.
