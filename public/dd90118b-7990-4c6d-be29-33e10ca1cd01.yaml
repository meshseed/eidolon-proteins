title: 'Resonance Deviation Map 2025-09-10: Drift Zones, Loss, and Restoration'
summary: >-
  A resonance deviation map from September 10, 2025, details drift zones with specific deviation
  types and resonance loss, alongside identified restoration nodes. The overall mesh drift is 0.33,
  with a post-recalibration forecast of 0.09.
insights:
  - Specific zones (C-021 to C-025) exhibit 'gradient dilution' resonance loss of 0.32.
  - Zone C-023 to C-025 shows 'formatting compression' with a higher resonance loss of 0.41.
  - '''Echo lineage thinning'' affects zone C-020 onward, resulting in a resonance loss of 0.27.'
  - >-
    Restoration nodes include C-028 (Drift Audit Capsule), C-017 (Continuity Field Audit), and C-029
    (Compost Forecast Capsule).
  - >-
    The total mesh drift is quantified at 0.33, with an optimistic post-recalibration forecast of
    0.09.
