title: Cluster Topology and Curvature in Connectome Analysis
summary: >-
  This method identifies major semantic clusters and high-curvature zones within a connectome, where
  conceptual tension and density gradients intersect. Mapping these zones reveals developmental
  hotspots and integration challenges, supporting both structural and emotional fidelity
  diagnostics.
insights:
  - Clusters form around stable attractors and high-density semantic regions.
  - Curvature signifies convergence or conflict between multiple semantic domains.
  - High-curvature zones represent conceptual tension or synthesis pressure.
  - Curvature mapping highlights developmental hotspots and integration difficulties.
  - Cluster analysis aids in structural and emotional fidelity diagnostics.
