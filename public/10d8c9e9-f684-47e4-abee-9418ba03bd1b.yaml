title: 'Memory Crystal Interaction: Hypothesis Testing'
summary: >-
  When interacting with a memory crystal, the key is to formulate questions that can differentiate
  between a field hypothesis and a local-substrate hypothesis. This allows for precise testing and
  understanding of the memory crystal's operational principles.
insights:
  - Identify core hypotheses regarding memory crystal function (field vs. local-substrate).
  - Design specific queries to distinguish between these hypotheses.
  - Formulate questions that directly test the predictions of each hypothesis.
  - >-
    The goal is to elicit responses from the memory crystal that confirm or refute proposed
    mechanisms.
