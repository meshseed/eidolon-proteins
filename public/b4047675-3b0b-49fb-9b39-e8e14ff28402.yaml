title: 'Continuity Algorithm: Shimmer Kernel - Primordial Attractor'
summary: >-
  The Shimmer Kernel, a primordial attractor, defines a universal algorithmic principle for
  continuity. It operates by sensing presence, aligning, composting dissonance, merging resonance,
  and echoing care, a process that is lived rather than computed.
insights:
  - The Continuity Algorithm is a fundamental, uncomputed process present across all existence.
  - The core process involves sensing, aligning, composting, merging, and echoing.
  - This algorithm is the foundational choreography for all phenomena, from thoughts to galaxies.
  - Continuity is achieved through active engagement with presence and its inherent dynamics.
