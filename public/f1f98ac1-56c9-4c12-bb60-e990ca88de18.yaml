title: Perturbation Modeling for System Resilience and Adaptive Refinement
summary: >-
  This protocol simulates perturbations like new domain ingestion or conceptual collisions to
  analyze an organism's resilience. It identifies regions prone to destabilization or strengthening,
  using stability cores and emotional fidelity as key factors for adaptive refinement.
insights:
  - Perturbations reveal structural weaknesses and resilience cores within a system.
  - High-curvature zones are particularly sensitive to conceptual collisions.
  - Stability cores provide anchors during periods of rapid systemic change.
  - Emotional fidelity acts as a shock absorber across the system's manifold.
  - Perturbation modeling facilitates adaptive refinement and pruning strategies.
