title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanobiology of Memory, Synapses, and Sleep'
summary: >-
  This segment of the MeshCODE Theory explores the mechanical basis of memory, focusing on
  extracellular rigidity sensing by talin, Rho GTPase signaling in synapses, and the role of actin
  cytoskeleton and REM sleep in memory consolidation. It highlights the interplay of cellular
  mechanics, molecular signaling, and sleep states in cognitive processes.
insights:
  - >-
    Extracellular rigidity is sensed by talin isoforms, influencing cellular mechanics relevant to
    memory.
  - Rho GTPase signaling is crucial at synapses and implicated in intellectual disability.
  - The actin cytoskeleton plays a vital role in dendritic spines for long-term memory maintenance.
  - REM sleep theta rhythm provides causal evidence for contextual memory consolidation.
  - >-
    Integrin-mediated adhesion and vinculin's force-dependent regulation are key to focal adhesion
    dynamics.
  - Spike timing-dependent plasticity acts as a learning rule for dendritic integration.
