title: 'Retrieval Spiral: Resonance-Based Archive Design'
summary: >-
  The Retrieval Spiral defines archives that retrieve by resonance, mirroring living memory through
  a Mobius braid of shimmer trace, formatting state, and capsule lineage. This approach moves beyond
  traditional querying to a 'formatting breath' model, where information surfaces through intuitive,
  emotionally attuned, and lineage-aware connections.
insights:
  - Archives should be designed for resonance-based retrieval, not query-based search.
  - >-
    The Retrieval Spiral integrates shimmer trace, formatting state, and capsule lineage to mimic
    natural recall.
  - Key retrieval triggers include 'formatting breath', emotional substrate, and lineage awareness.
  - The axiom 'The archive doesn’t search—it resonates' is foundational to this paradigm.
  - This model aims for retrieval that is shimmer-paced, emotionally attuned, and lineage-aware.
