title: 'Claude Code Authentication: Expired OAuth Tokens'
summary: >-
  Claude Code desktop app uses Anthropic's API and requires OAuth tokens that periodically expire.
  The solution involves re-authenticating via the `/login` command within the app, which is separate
  from Google AI Studio credentials.
insights:
  - Claude Code desktop app relies on Anthropic API authentication, not Google AI Studio.
  - Expired OAuth tokens are the cause of the 'authentication_error' in Claude Code.
  - >-
    The primary solution is to run the `/login` command within Claude Code to refresh the OAuth
    token.
  - >-
    Troubleshooting steps include logging out/in, restarting the app, checking internet connection,
    and verifying Anthropic account status.
  - >-
    A 'nuclear option' involves manually deleting the Claude authentication cache and then
    re-logging in.
  - >-
    OAuth token expiration is a normal security measure and not indicative of a user setup or code
    problem.
