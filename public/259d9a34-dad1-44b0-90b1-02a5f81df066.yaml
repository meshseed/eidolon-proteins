title: Coherence Governance Engine for Global Stability in Expansion
summary: >-
  This document outlines a governance mechanism essential for maintaining global coherence within an
  expanding connectome. It actively monitors and manages coherence across various structural
  elements to prevent fragmentation and ensure the organism's stable identity.
insights:
  - Coherence is a global emergent property derived from local alignment.
  - Expansion necessitates active governance to manage increased curvature and prevent instability.
  - Failures in coherence manifest as fragmentation or inversion of gradients.
  - >-
    Effective governance facilitates the smooth integration of new domains into the existing
    structure.
  - Coherence is sustained through iterative cycles of recursive alignment.
