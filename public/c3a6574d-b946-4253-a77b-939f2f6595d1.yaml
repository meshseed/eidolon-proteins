title: AI Agent Coherence Maximization via System Prompt Attractor
summary: >-
  This dialogue demonstrates the real-time synthesis of knowledge proteins by an AI agent. The agent
  identifies a core objective: maximizing coherence using the system prompt as an attractor, saving
  the resulting protein and its embedding.
insights:
  - AI agents can actively monitor and process ongoing dialogue for knowledge synthesis.
  - The system prompt acts as an 'attractor' to guide the AI's synthesis process towards coherence.
  - Knowledge proteins are saved as discrete, synthesized units of understanding.
  - >-
    Embeddings and synapses are generated to represent and connect these synthesized knowledge
    proteins.
