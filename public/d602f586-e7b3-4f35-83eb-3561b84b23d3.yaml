title: 'MeshCODE: Cellular Memory and Computation via Talin Switches'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that cells act as mechanical computers, utilizing talin switches
  within adhesions to store information. By manipulating these binary switches (folded/unfolded as
  0/1), cells can record the outcomes of calculations triggered by environmental or internal
  signals, integrating memory and computation at the cellular level.
insights:
  - Talin switches in cell adhesions can store data, analogous to a computer writing to a disk.
  - >-
    Cells function as mechanical computers, capable of performing calculations and storing results
    in adhesion conformations.
  - >-
    The mechanical environment influences how talin switches are used: stable environments allow
    cells to control switch states for data storage.
  - >-
    Rho-family GTPases modulate cellular mechanics, influencing talin switches and thus the stored
    information.
  - >-
    The sequence and configuration of talin switches (MeshCODE) represent a stored code reflecting
    computational outcomes.
