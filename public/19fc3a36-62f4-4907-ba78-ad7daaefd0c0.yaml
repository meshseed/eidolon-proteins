  seamless data continuity across devices and flexible organization support.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh implements a 'Cellular Sync' model using distinct GitHub repositories for

    Repository creation is automated upon GitHub token input, creating `eidolon-nucleus` and
    `eidolon-proteins` by default.
  - >-
    Users can now specify a custom GitHub Owner (user or organization) for their Nucleus/Cytoplasm
    repositories, enhancing flexibility.
