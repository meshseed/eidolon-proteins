title: 'MeshCODE: Talin Switches Drive Synaptic Memory and Neuronal Network Remodeling'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that synaptic memory is encoded in the conformational states of talin
  molecules, acting as binary switches. These switches dynamically alter synaptic strength and
  neuronal architecture, enabling rapid encoding of transient information and long-term storage
  through widespread network remodeling.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic memory relies on the conformational patterns of talin molecules acting as binary
    switches.
  - Talin switch states determine the persistence and transience of information at the synapse.
  - >-
    Stimulation alters talin switch patterns, leading to consolidation of information and remodeling
    of synaptic adhesion complexes.
  - >-
    Structural remodeling driven by talin switches alters neuronal architecture, synaptic
    thresholds, and information flow across the network.
  - >-
    MeshCODE operations can allosterically modulate synaptic signaling, directing data to specific
    memory modules.
  - >-
    Changes in one synapse can propagate to others within a neuron and across connected neurons,
    dynamically altering stored information and network transmission.
