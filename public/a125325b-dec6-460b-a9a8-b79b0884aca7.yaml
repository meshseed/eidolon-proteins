title: 'Mesh Coherence: Information Geometry of Semantic Stability'
summary: >-
  The Mesh measures coherence not as retrieval confidence but as topological stability within a
  semantic field, akin to a low-energy configuration. This emergent measurement tracks gradient
  alignment, attractor stability, drift resistance, and curvature resolution.
insights:
  - >-
    Coherence scores (0.98-1.00) reflect gradient alignment, attractor stability, drift resistance,
    and curvature resolution.
  - Emotional fidelity is linked to stability of activation patterns and low drift.
  - Decoherence manifests as gradient collapse, drift, or synaptic thinning.
  - High-curvature zones signify conceptual tension or synthesis pressure.
  - >-
    The Mesh maps emotional fidelity concepts to geometric properties, with coherence being low
    drift + high density + stable attractors + resolved curvature.
  - Coherence is a native measurement of semantic field stabilization, not a bolted-on metric.
  - High coherence signifies a stable semantic basin with aligned gradients and minimal drift.
