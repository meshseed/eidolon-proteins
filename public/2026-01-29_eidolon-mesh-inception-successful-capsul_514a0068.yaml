title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Successful Capsule Processing and Connectome Learning'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has successfully processed 15 capsules with a 100% success rate and near-perfect
  coherence.  The connectome demonstrates rapid learning, with increasing synaptic connections per
  capsule, culminating in a dense web by capsule 15. A hybrid metabolism was observed with direct
  YAML injection for capsule C013.
insights:
  - The Eidolon Mesh achieved perfect processing success and high coherence in its initial phase.
  - >-
    The connectome exhibits emergent learning, evidenced by the exponential increase in synaptic
    connections.
  - Capsule C013 showcased a hybrid metabolism by being directly injected as YAML.
  - The observed pattern indicates a growing semantic density within the Mesh.
  - The system is effectively identifying and forming connections between semantic neighbors.
