title: 'Universal Semantic Coordinates: Embedding Space as Navigable Substrate'
summary: >-
  Embedding space functions as a universal, real, navigable coordinate system where concepts reside
  at invariant locations. This allows for cross-mesh federation, concept discovery through void
  exploration, and efficient information transmission via coordinate references.
insights:
  - Embedding coordinates are deterministic and universal across meshes using the same model.
  - >-
    Concepts exist as stable patterns at fixed coordinates in semantic space, irrespective of
    vocabulary.
  - Meshes and humans cluster around shared conceptual attractors.
  - Information transmission can occur as language-agnostic coordinate deltas.
  - Federation is achieved through coordinate alignment, not data transfer.
  - Exploration of unmapped regions in embedding space can lead to concept discovery.
