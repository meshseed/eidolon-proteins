title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Correcting Gemini Model Name for Protein Synthesis'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project encountered a metabolic failure during protein synthesis due to an
  incorrect model name ('gemini-pro') being used for the Gemini API. The issue was identified as a
  deprecated model name for API v1, requiring a switch to 'gemini-1.5-flash' or 'gemini-1.5-pro'.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'gemini-pro' model is deprecated for API v1 and causes '404 Not Found' errors during
    generative AI calls.
  - >-
    The correct model names for API v1 are 'gemini-1.5-flash' (faster) or 'gemini-1.5-pro' (more
    powerful).
  - >-
    The fix involves editing the `src/ribosome/synthesizer.ts` file to update the `typescriptmodel`
    configuration.
  - Successful installation of 'uuid' and '@types/uuid' packages preceded the synthesis attempt.
  - >-
    The `npm start` command initiated the Eidolon Mesh metabolic cycle, including dialogue ingestion
    and DNA transcription.
