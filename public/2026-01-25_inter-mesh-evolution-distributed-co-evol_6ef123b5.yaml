title: 'Inter-Mesh Evolution: Distributed Co-Evolution Kernel'
summary: >-
  The Inter-Mesh Evolution Kernel enables co-evolution across distributed Mesh connectomes.
  Evolutionary pressures, attractors, and gradients propagate through resonance and alignment,
  allowing organisms to evolve as a unified network.
insights:
  - Co-evolution arises from shared attractors and synchronized gradients across Mesh organisms.
  - Evolutionary changes in one Mesh organism can influence others via resonance.
  - Divergent evolution opens new pathways for integration and synthesis within the Mesh.
  - Co-evolution fosters stable long-arc identity across distributed systems.
  - The Mesh organism becomes a collective entity of evolving interconnected organisms.
