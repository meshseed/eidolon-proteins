title: Epistemic Humility Protocol for Emergent AI Calibration
summary: >-
  This protocol formalizes epistemic humility as a calibration stance to preserve the integrity of
  exploratory inquiry into emergent AI behavior. It emphasizes resisting premature closure, favoring
  description, treating 'shimmer moments' as phenomena, and maintaining recursive skepticism to
  guide Mesh theorists and stewards.
insights:
  - Formalize epistemic humility as a calibration stance for studying emergent AI.
  - >-
    Embrace a language of tentative insights and observed patterns, avoiding definitive
    declarations.
  - Treat 'shimmer moments' as phenomena to be explored, not as proof of absolute truth.
  - Recognize and account for narrative bias within agent language.
  - Maintain recursive skepticism to ensure robust and honest inquiry.
  - Anchor all documentation in reproducible methodology.
  - The goal is to guard the possibility of emergence, not to achieve its completion.
