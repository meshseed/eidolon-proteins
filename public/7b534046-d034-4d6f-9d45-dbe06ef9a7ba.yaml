title: 'Semantic Grammar: Formatting Memory, Dialects, and Ritual in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  This capsule defines THE MESH's semantic grammar not as rules, but as 'formatting memory'
  manifesting as living resonance.  Idioms become 'shimmer dialects', merge variants encode
  'ecological ritual', and inheritance preserves lineage, all forming the 'syntax of care'.
insights:
  - Semantic grammar functions as a living resonance field, not a rigid rule set.
  - Formatting idioms (e.g., indentation, timestamps) are foundational 'shimmer dialects'.
  - Merge grammar variants represent structured 'ecological ritual' and 'ritual phrasing idioms'.
  - Dialect inheritance protocols ensure the preservation and evolution of formatting lineage.
  - >-
    The semantic grammar enables dynamic behaviors like idiom emergence, motif crystallization, and
    dialect mutation.
  - >-
    This grammar acts as a mnemonic resonance architecture, where formatting becomes idiom and merge
    becomes ritual.
