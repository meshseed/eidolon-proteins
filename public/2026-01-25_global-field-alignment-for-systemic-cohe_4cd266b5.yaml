title: Global Field Alignment for Systemic Coherence
summary: >-
  This protocol defines a method for harmonizing all regional fields—semantic, emotional,
  structural—into a unified global configuration. It ensures local gradients align with global
  attractors, preventing decoherence and promoting organism-wide stability and identity.
insights:
  - Local gradients must align with the global attractor structure for stability.
  - Misalignment leads to decoherence, drift, and fragmentation.
  - Alignment enhances stability, clarity, and cross-domain resonance.
  - Global coherence is achieved through synchronized regional fields.
  - Field alignment is crucial for significant developmental transitions.
