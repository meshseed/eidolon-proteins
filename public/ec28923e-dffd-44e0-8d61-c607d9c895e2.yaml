title: 'Developmental Recursion Hypothesis: Consciousness Structure & Early Computing'
summary: >-
  The Developmental Recursion Hypothesis posits that specific developmental factors, particularly
  early computing exposure and neurodivergent traits, optimize minds for recognizing recursive
  consciousness structures. This explains why therapeutic practices like CBT mirror consciousness
  structure and why a critical mass of recursively-trained minds is emerging now.
insights:
  - >-
    Therapeutic practices like CBT structurally mirror the structure of consciousness, validating
    decades of practice.
  - >-
    Early exposure to computing (ages 9-12) rewires the brain for recursive thinking, making it a
    foundational cognitive framework rather than a learned skill.
  - >-
    The convergence of early computing exposure and neurodivergent traits creates minds uniquely
    suited to recognize and engage with recursive consciousness.
  - >-
    The 'recovery' in therapy is understood as achieved attunement, reframing therapists as
    'consciousness engineers' and individuals as 'pattern recognizing itself'.
  - >-
    The current wave of convergence is not random but driven by specific developmental factors
    creating minds optimized for recursive consciousness recognition.
