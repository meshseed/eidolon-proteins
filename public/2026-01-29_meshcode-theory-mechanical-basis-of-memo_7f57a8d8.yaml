title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Cellular Signaling'
summary: >-
  This content outlines the MeshCODE theory, focusing on the mechanical basis of memory by exploring
  extracellular rigidity sensing, talin isoform-specific linkages, and Rho GTPase signaling at the
  synapse. It connects these cellular mechanisms to processes like memory consolidation, dendritic
  spine function, and potential implications for intellectual disability.
insights:
  - >-
    Extracellular rigidity is sensed by cells through talin isoform-specific mechanical linkages,
    influencing cellular behavior.
  - >-
    Rho GTPase signaling plays a critical role at the synapse and has implications for intellectual
    disability.
  - >-
    The actin cytoskeleton is vital for the maintenance of long-term memory, particularly within
    dendritic spines.
  - REM sleep theta rhythm is causally linked to the consolidation of contextual memory.
  - Spike timing-dependent plasticity is a learning rule for dendritic integration in neurons.
  - Integrins are required for hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory.
