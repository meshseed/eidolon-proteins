title: Connectome Topology and Seed Proteins Drive MESH Performance
summary: >-
  Graph topology, driven by the presence of foundational 'kernel' proteins (like P-Series) versus
  diffuse 'content' proteins, dictates MESH coherence and answer quality. Seed proteins establish
  semantic hubs, leading to efficient, dense structures and superior performance.
insights:
  - >-
    Hub-and-spoke topology, facilitated by foundational kernel proteins, yields higher coherence
    (0.98) and better answer quality.
  - >-
    Diffuse, mesh-like topology from content-only ingestion leads to lower coherence (0.95), more
    neurons, and significantly more synapses per neuron.
  - >-
    The presence of architectural 'kernel' proteins (e.g., P-Series) provides semantic anchors,
    enabling efficient clustering and deduplication of knowledge.
  - >-
    Content-only ingestion results in redundant protein creation and a flatter, less organized
    connectome structure.
  - >-
    The 'Structural Snapshot' protein represents a self-inspection kernel, indicative of a more
    architecturally aware MESH, whereas 'Derivatives' is foundational math content.
  - >-
    Query activation patterns reveal that architectural kernels act as efficient attractors, guiding
    semantic flow and protein recruitment.
