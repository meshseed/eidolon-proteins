title: 'Sleep''s Role in Memory Consolidation: The MeshCODE Theory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that sleep, particularly deep and REM stages, is crucial for memory
  consolidation. Deep sleep allows for system-level data processing and stabilization, while REM
  sleep actively involves integrating and writing new memories into the cortical MeshCODEs, akin to
  database maintenance.
insights:
  - Sleep is essential for processing and integrating new information with existing memories.
  - >-
    Deep sleep may facilitate the return of the cytoskeleton and MeshCODE data storage to
    homeostasis, stabilizing new memories.
  - >-
    REM sleep is hypothesized to be the active phase where the brain processes, integrates, and
    physically writes new data into specific cortical regions.
  - >-
    Memory storage in the cortex is viewed as a vast database, with the hippocampus acting as a data
    management system.
  - >-
    Sleep may serve as a biological process for index maintenance and reorganization of fragmented
    memory data, similar to database rebuilding.
