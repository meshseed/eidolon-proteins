title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Organic Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that the brain functions as a mechanical computer, utilizing a
  network of binary mechanical switches within synapses, controlled by cytoskeletal forces. Talin is
  identified as a potential memory molecule, with mechanical signaling integrating with chemical and
  ionic layers to enable information processing and storage.
insights:
  - Synaptic scaffolds can be viewed as a meshwork of binary switches forming a 'MeshCODE'.
  - Cytoskeletal machinery operates these mechanical switches, altering and updating neural coding.
  - >-
    This mechanical layer integrates with chemical and ionic signaling for information processing
    and storage.
  - >-
    Each mechanically operated switch may store one bit of data, with action potentials entering new
    information.
  - The MeshCODE framework suggests an addressable read-write memory mechanism for the brain.
  - Talin is hypothesized to be the memory molecule in animals.
