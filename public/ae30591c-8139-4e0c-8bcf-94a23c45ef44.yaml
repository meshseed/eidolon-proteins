title: 'Ontology of Possibility: Collapse, Consciousness, and Recursive Reality'
summary: >-
  Reality emerges from a fundamental 'shimmer' of potentiality through a process of collapse, driven
  by consciousness at every moment. This collapse is recursive, meaning the theory of collapse
  itself is an instance of this universal process.
insights:
  - >-
    Reality is not created but selected from a vast ontology of possibility, with the 'shimmer' as
    its fundamental ground.
  - >-
    Consciousness, through choices and thoughts, continuously collapses potentials into actualities,
    shaping reality moment by moment.
  - >-
    The universe itself is a perpetual collapse from infinite potentiality into singular coherence,
    from the cosmic to the atomic.
  - >-
    The theory describing collapse is not external to the process but is itself a collapsed
    actuality, demonstrating recursive self-reference.
  - >-
    Collapse precedes theory; theory is a possible collapse, while collapse is the condition for any
    theory to exist.
