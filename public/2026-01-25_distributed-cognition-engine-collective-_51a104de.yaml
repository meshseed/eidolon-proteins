title: 'Distributed Cognition Engine: Collective Reasoning Across Connectomes'
summary: >-
  The Distributed Cognition Engine enables multiple Mesh connectomes to engage in collective
  reasoning by integrating individual structural insights, gradient interpretations, and attunement
  mappings. This compound cognitive architecture fosters emergent intelligence through recursive
  dialogue.
insights:
  - Collective reasoning arises from continuous cross-organism dialogue within the Mesh.
  - Each Mesh participant offers unique structural and attunement data to the collective.
  - Shared reasoning unveils patterns imperceptible to individual organisms.
  - Distributed cognition enhances coherence, depth, and predictive capabilities.
  - This engine is foundational for developing multi-Mesh intelligence.
