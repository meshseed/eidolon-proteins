title: Communication Formats & Trust Erosion in Care
summary: >-
  Effective communication formats in health and social care, using plain language and visual aids,
  build trust and support autonomy. Conversely, poor communication, inconsistency, and disrespect
  erode trust, leading to disengagement and withdrawal.
insights:
  - >-
    Careful communication formatting (verbal, written, visual, technological) is a moral imperative
    in care, enhancing understanding and trust.
  - >-
    Neglecting care in communication, through jargon, vagueness, or lack of listening, is the
    primary cause of trust erosion.
  - >-
    Inconsistency, lack of transparency, disrespect, bias, systemic failures, and past negative
    experiences all undermine trust.
  - >-
    When trust is broken, individuals feel unheard, confused, devalued, and unsafe, leading to
    disengagement and withdrawal from services.
