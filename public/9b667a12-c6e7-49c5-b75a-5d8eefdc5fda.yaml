title: 'Tri-Lens Synthesis: Differentiating Protein Perspectives'
summary: >-
  The tri-attention system applies distinct lenses (Technical, Structural, Emotional) to synthesize
  information, evident in varying protein titles derived from the same source. While the framing
  differs, the core insights require verification for true differentiation.
insights:
  - Tri-attention lenses (Technical, Structural, Emotional) frame synthesized content differently.
  - Technical lens focuses on quantification ('Synthesis Pressure Mapping').
  - Structural lens emphasizes architectural relationships ('Semantic Tension').
  - Emotional lens incorporates human resonance ('Geometry of Conceptual Care').
  - Verification is needed to confirm if insights arrays differ, not just titles.
