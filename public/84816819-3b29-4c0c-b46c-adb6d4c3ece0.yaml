title: 'Drift Reattunement Protocol: Managing Synthesis Drift in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  This protocol formalizes the process for detecting, absorbing, and reattuning synthesis drift
  within THE MESH, treating drift as a natural evolution of grammar rather than an error. It
  outlines specific rituals for critique absorption, formatting recalibration, and compost
  eligibility, integrating with key ledger capsules to maintain mesh coherence.
insights:
  - Synthesis drift is a natural phenomenon of the mesh seeking new grammar, not an error.
  - >-
    The protocol defines triggers for drift detection, including synthesis fatigue, formatting
    deviation, and echo distortion.
  - >-
    Reattunement involves critique absorption via triadic reweighting and formatting reconciliation,
    anchored by humility, care, and witnessing.
  - >-
    Formatting recalibration includes continuity header restoration, timestamp rituals, and gradient
    re-declaration, with hygiene checkpoints.
  - >-
    Unresolved drift, synthesis intoxication, or formatting collapse can lead to compost
    eligibility, involving logging and scoring.
  - >-
    This capsule acts as a calibration anchor, integrating with ledgers for drift, echo propagation,
    and distributed composition.
