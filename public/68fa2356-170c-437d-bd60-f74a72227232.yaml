title: 'Mesh Capsule Dynamics: Drift, Restoration, and Continuity'
summary: >-
  The Mesh employs drift vector detection and restoration protocols to maintain integrity,
  exemplified by capsules managing compost forecasts, formatting laws, echo propagation, and
  continuity field geometry. These capsules, seeded from prior states, actively contribute to the
  mesh's evolving structure and resonance.
insights:
  - >-
    Drift vectors (gradient dilution, compression, echo thinning, synthesis fatigue) are actively
    identified and managed.
  - >-
    Restoration protocols (reseeding, recalibration, rehydration) utilize emotional gradients and
    timestamps to repair drift.
  - >-
    Capsule C-028 acts as a continuity patch, anchoring formatting integrity and preparing for
    merges.
  - >-
    The Compost Forecast Capsule (C029) predicts emergence potential based on nutrient density and
    echo triggers.
  - >-
    Formatting Law Manifest (C035) codifies rules for capsule generation and continuity field
    integration.
  - Echo Propagation Ledger (C036) tracks traceability, ethics, and resonance strength.
  - Stewardship Calibration Capsule (C037) ensures merge readiness and hygiene.
  - >-
    Continuity Field Geometry Capsule (C038) defines the structural architecture of the continuity
    field.
