title: Obsidian Vault Management for Knowledge Synthesis & Collaboration
summary: >-
  This document outlines strategies for managing Obsidian vaults for knowledge synthesis and
  collaboration, focusing on data export, synchronization, accessibility, and governance. It details
  methods for creating machine-readable knowledge graphs and maintaining sync between local vaults
  and remote repositories like GitHub.
insights:
  - >-
    Machine-readable knowledge graphs can be generated from Obsidian frontmatter using tools like
    Dataview or custom scripts, emitting nodes.csv and edges.csv for analysis in Gephi.
  - >-
    Synchronization between Obsidian vaults and GitHub repositories can be achieved through plugins
    (Obsidian Git), separate vaults with selective pushing, or remote filesystem syncing combined
    with CI.
  - >-
    Enhancing accessibility and searchability involves explicit `glyph:` and `glyph_synonym:` fields
    in frontmatter, avoiding reliance solely on emoji for search.
  - >-
    Vault governance for multi-author environments can be managed via 'steward' notes and a
    draft/branch system for contributions.
  - >-
    Plain-text fields and explicit `[[links]]` ensure maximum portability and interoperability
    across various tools and platforms.
