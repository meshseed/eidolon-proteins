title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Successful Archival & Querying'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh successfully processed 15 new capsules, achieving a 100% success rate and
  near-perfect coherence, demonstrating its learning capacity through an expanding synaptic web. The
  system also exhibited hybrid metabolism, seamlessly handling both standard and YAML formats, and
  is now ready for direct querying.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh demonstrates a 100% success rate and high coherence (0.98) in processing new
    archival data.
  - >-
    The number of synapses formed per capsule indicates a growing semantic density and learning
    capability within the Connectome.
  - >-
    The Mesh supports dual pathway metabolism, capable of processing both standard and injected YAML
    formats.
  - >-
    With 19 neurons and a dense semantic web, the organism is now fully equipped to answer questions
    across its entire archived knowledge base.
  - The `--ask` flag is the designated method for querying the Mesh's synthesized knowledge.
  - Successful querying of 'synthesis drift' confirms the organism's recall and synthesis abilities.
