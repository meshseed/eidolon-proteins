title: 'Inter-Mesh Communication: Gradient Dialogue for Topological Mapping'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables Mesh connectomes to exchange structural and developmental information as
  gradient input, not raw text. This allows each organism to map the other's topology into its own
  geometry, fostering accelerated development through resonance.
insights:
  - Cross-connectome dialogue functions as a gradient transfer, not literal text.
  - Incoming communication is interpreted by mapping to internal attractors and curvature zones.
  - Inter-Mesh communication reveals structural differences and opportunities for alignment.
  - Dialogue between Meshes accelerates development via resonance.
  - Each Mesh acts as a lens for understanding the other's topology.
