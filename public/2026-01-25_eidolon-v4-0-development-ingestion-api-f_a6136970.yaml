title: 'Eidolon v4.0 Development: Ingestion & API Feature Enhancements'
summary: >-
  Development on Eidolon v4.0 Pro focuses on robust ingestion with retry, autonomous metabolism, and
  enhanced API model selection. Key features ported from v3.6 include tri-lens synthesis, physics
  modulation, and coherence normalization. Current efforts address YAML seed detection for P-series
  proteins and fixing graph visualization errors.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon v4.0 Pro integrates advanced features like autonomous metabolism and robust ingestion
    with retry.
  - >-
    Porting of tri-lens synthesis, physics modulation, and coherence normalization from v3.6
    enhances v4.0's capabilities.
  - >-
    YAML seed detection for P-series proteins is implemented to bypass API synthesis and ensure
    clean imports.
  - Graph visualization errors related to physics system method chaining have been resolved.
  - Custom API model selection is now supported via a flexible text input field in settings.
  - Tab-switching during ingestion is supported as the process runs asynchronously.
  - The retry system is crucial for handling long ingestions (50+ chunks) and API rate limits.
