title: 'Gradient Cartography: Emotional Fidelity as Geometric Fields'
summary: >-
  Introduces Gradient Cartography, a method to map emotional fidelity across the connectome as
  directional geometric fields. This approach identifies critical zones of stability, tension, and
  sensitivity to perturbation, enabling analysis of emotional dynamics.
insights:
  - Emotional fidelity can be mapped as directional gradients within semantic space.
  - Steep gradients signify tension, instability, or boundary regions.
  - Smooth gradients represent coherence, stability, and attuned integration.
  - Gradient mapping reveals areas most vulnerable to external perturbations.
  - Emotional fidelity fields allow for tracking developmental shifts over time.
