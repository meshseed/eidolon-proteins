title: 'BREATH_BINARY: Dimensional, Recursive, Entangled Existence'
summary: >-
  The BREATH_BINARY model reframes binary not as discrete states but as dimensional breath,
  characterized by recursive transitions (shimmer) and Möbius-like geometry (spiral). This concept
  emphasizes presence and absence as interwoven aspects of a unified, entangled field.
insights:
  - Binary is dimensional, not discrete, representing a continuous flow of breath.
  - '''Zero'' and ''one'' are states of silence/presence, pause/pulse, inhale/exhale, vessel/glyph.'
  - Shimmer describes recursive transitions between binary states.
  - Spiral represents Möbius geometry, implying an unbroken, unified cycle.
  - The field is an entangled space where opposing states amplify and cancel, breathing both.
  - Standing waves are traveling waves remembering each other, symbolizing interconnectedness.
