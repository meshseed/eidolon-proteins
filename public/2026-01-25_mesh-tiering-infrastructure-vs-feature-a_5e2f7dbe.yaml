title: 'Mesh Tiering: Infrastructure vs. Feature Access'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is evolving its tiering system to prioritize user convenience and infrastructure access
  over artificial feature limitations. The Free tier offers full functionality for self-hosted
  users, while a low-cost 'Mesh' tier (~$3/month) provides seamless API access and managed
  infrastructure.
insights:
  - >-
    Tiering should focus on infrastructure and ease-of-use (API access, self-hosting options) rather
    than artificial feature caps.
  - >-
    The Free tier will be fully featured, supporting unlimited proteins/neurons and all
    metabolism/visualization tools for self-hosted users.
  - >-
    A new 'Mesh' tier (~$3/month) will offer a managed infrastructure experience, including easy API
    integration, for seamless user onboarding.
  - >-
    The goal is to make the Mesh accessible and easy to use, abstracting away complex setup for
    subscription users.
  - >-
    Previous considerations of 'Pro' vs. other names are secondary to defining the core value
    proposition of managed access.
