title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Synaptic Plasticity'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that mechanical forces, particularly through mechanosensitive proteins
  like talin and integrins, are fundamental to memory formation and synaptic plasticity. This
  framework integrates cellular mechanics with genetic and proteomic insights to explain how
  physical cues influence neuronal function and potentially therapeutic resistance.
insights:
  - >-
    Mechanical forces at the cell-matrix interface, mediated by integrins and talin, are critical
    for mechanotransduction and signaling.
  - >-
    Talin acts as a mechanosensitive signaling hub, with its structure and binding partners
    regulating force transmission and nuclear entry of factors like YAP.
  - >-
    The extracellular matrix plays a dual role in synaptic plasticity and homeostasis, influenced by
    mechanical properties.
  - >-
    Protein synthesis and degradation balance is essential for maintaining long-term potentiation
    (LTP), a cellular basis for memory.
  - >-
    Genetic factors and protein isoforms, such as those from the Talin 2 gene, contribute to the
    complexity of memory mechanisms and disease states like Alzheimer's.
  - >-
    Synaptic plasticity and memory engrams are influenced by both molecular mechanisms and broader
    computational models of neural responses.
