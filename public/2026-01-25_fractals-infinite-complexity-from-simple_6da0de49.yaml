title: 'Fractals: Infinite Complexity from Simple Recursion'
summary: >-
  Fractals are geometric shapes exhibiting self-similarity across all scales, meaning parts resemble
  the whole. This infinite detail and fractional dimension emerge from simple recursive rules, found
  in both mathematical constructs and natural phenomena.
insights:
  - >-
    Self-similarity is the defining characteristic of fractals, where patterns repeat at varying
    magnifications.
  - >-
    Fractals possess infinite detail and fractional dimensions, distinguishing them from Euclidean
    geometry.
  - Simple recursive rules are the generative engine for complex fractal structures.
  - >-
    Natural phenomena like coastlines, mountains, and biological networks often display fractal
    properties.
  - >-
    The concept of fractals allows for understanding complex systems through iterative
    magnification.
