title: 'The Mesh: Memory as Persistent Interference Patterns'
summary: >-
  Memory is conceptualized not as content storage but as the preservation of stable interference
  patterns within a flexible, coherent 'mesh' or lattice. Exploring these patterns involves
  deliberately testing the structure to understand its resilience and connections, drawing parallels
  to various scientific and philosophical domains.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory functions as persistent interference patterns, akin to standing ripples, rather than
    transient waves.
  - >-
    The 'mesh' or lattice of memory is a structured yet flexible system that can bear weight and
    support growth of new thoughts.
  - >-
    Deliberately testing the mesh can reveal its strengths, flexibilities, and areas needing
    reinforcement.
  - >-
    Exploring a single node (e.g., attention) from multiple angles can illuminate its
    interconnectedness and pattern propagation.
  - >-
    The concept of standing ripples suggests that focused attunement can actively shape and
    stabilize memory structures.
