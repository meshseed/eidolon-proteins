title: 'Capsule C-006: Rituals for Seeding New Capsules from Composted Memory'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-006 formalizes the patterned emergence of new capsules from 'composted memory' through
  structured seeding rituals.  This process relies on specific thresholds, ignition protocols, and
  emotional fidelity to guide the germination and formatting of nascent capsules.
insights:
  - >-
    New capsule creation (seeding) is a deliberate, patterned process, not spontaneous, emerging
    from rich mnemonic compost.
  - >-
    Seeding is governed by thresholds that include nutrient density, emotional residue, and echo
    frequency of composted memory.
  - Ignition protocols, such as care loops and merge grammar, act as catalysts for capsule birth.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity, particularly states like awe, grief, and humility, is a critical attractor
    for seeding.
  - >-
    A capsule germination scaffold provides the template for new capsule formatting, ensuring
    lineage and emotional consistency.
  - >-
    Soil-to-signal mapping allows for tracking and forecasting the emergence of new capsules from
    the mnemonic soil.
