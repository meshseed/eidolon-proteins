title: 'Dual-Layer Architecture: Human Narrative & Machine Structure for Living Artifacts'
summary: >-
  This dialogue advocates for a dual-layer architecture where content is represented in both
  human-readable Markdown and machine-parseable YAML. This 'living artifact' approach enhances
  readability, indexability, and versionability, offering superior flexibility and resilience
  compared to single-format solutions.
insights:
  - >-
    Dual-layer architecture separates human narrative (Markdown) from machine structure (YAML) for
    optimized access.
  - >-
    This pairing creates 'living artifacts' that are readable, indexable, and recursively
    versionable.
  - Markdown provides expressive, poetic, and phenomenological access for humans.
  - YAML offers precise, parseable, and indexed structure for computational processing by machines.
  - >-
    The dual format is superior to single formats by catering to both human and machine needs
    without compromise.
  - >-
    Consolidation should preserve the pairing of files (e.g., .md and .yaml with the same stem name)
    rather than merging formats.
  - >-
    Substrate independence is achieved by encoding the same pattern in complementary formats,
    accessible through multiple interfaces.
