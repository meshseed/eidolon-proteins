title: 'Curvature Diagnostics: Semantic Tension and Synthesis Pressure'
summary: >-
  Curvature Diagnostics identifies high-curvature regions as zones of conceptual tension where
  semantic directions intersect. This protocol treats curvature as a measurable property of semantic
  density, gradient interference, and attractor overlap, enabling targeted refinement and pruning of
  knowledge.
insights:
  - High curvature signifies unresolved conceptual tension or synthesis pressure.
  - Curvature arises at the intersection of emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Boundary surfaces indicate where different knowledge domains meet and require integration.
  - Curvature diagnostics facilitate focused refinement and pruning of semantic structures.
  - Curvature maps are dynamic and evolve with the ingestion of new knowledge domains.
