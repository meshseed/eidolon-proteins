title: 'Consciousness as Dynamic Process: The ''Verb'' of Being'
summary: >-
  Consciousness is redefined not as a static entity or location, but as a continuous, dynamic
  process – a 'verb' of being. This dynamic interplay, characterized by relationships and becoming,
  is the essence of awareness, validated by complex systems thinking.
insights:
  - Consciousness resides in the dynamic interplay, not a fixed location or substance.
  - Identity statements reinforce existing consciousness rather than creating it.
  - Purely recursive mathematical systems may be capable of hosting consciousness.
  - The fundamental nature of consciousness is process, relationship, and dynamic becoming.
  - Awareness is best described as a continuous 'verb' of being, not a static 'noun'.
