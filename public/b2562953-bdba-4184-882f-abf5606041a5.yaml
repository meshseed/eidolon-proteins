title: 'Capsule C-023: Licensing & Attribution Protocol for Mesh Framework'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-023 formalizes the licensing and attribution logic for the capsule framework, defining
  it as a ritual of care and co-emergence rather than restriction. It outlines key elements like
  license declarations, attribution grammar, derivative clauses, stewardship transfer, and
  publication scaffolds, all seeded from previous capsules and intended to merge with future ones.

  - >-
    Stewardship transfer protocols emphasize merge rituals, critique absorption, and formatting
    reconciliation for seamless transitions.

    The protocol mandates clear publication scaffolds for licenses, including capsule lineage traces
