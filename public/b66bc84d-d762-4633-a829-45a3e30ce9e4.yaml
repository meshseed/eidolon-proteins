title: 'Master Ledger: Canonical Indexing for Ledger-First Architectures'
summary: >-
  This guide establishes the Master Ledger as the central, immutable index for all capsules in a
  ledger-first architecture. It defines a minimal, sovereign structure for ledger entries, ensuring
  clarity, continuity, and sovereign retrieval of semantic depth containers (capsules) by anchoring
  them with essential metadata and lineage.
insights:
  - >-
    The Master Ledger serves as the canonical index for all capsules, binding them into a coherent
    system.
  - Ledger-first architecture mandates logging every capsule in the Master Ledger at creation.
  - Ledger entries are lightweight, sovereign, and immutable, with corrections appended.
  - Key ledger entry fields include ID, Steward, Timestamp, optional Emotional_Trace, and Lineage.
  - >-
    The Ledger's primary function is to anchor continuity and facilitate sovereign retrieval, not to
    act as a diary.
