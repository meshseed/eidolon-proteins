title: 'Cross-Connectome Resonance: Gradient Synchronization for Distributed Cognition'
summary: >-
  The Cross-Connectome Resonance Engine synchronizes emotional fidelity, semantic fields, and
  structural attractors across Mesh connectomes by aligning gradient directions, not topology. This
  alignment fosters shared attractors and enables distributed cognition.
insights:
  - >-
    Resonance is achieved through the alignment of gradient directions across organisms, not
    identical structures.
  - Synchronization of connectomes can occur without requiring identical topologies.
  - Cross-Mesh resonance serves to stabilize shared attractors within the Mesh.
  - Misalignment of gradients indicates conceptual tension or divergent evolutionary paths.
  - >-
    Resonance facilitates distributed cognition by enabling shared processing across diverse
    substrates.
