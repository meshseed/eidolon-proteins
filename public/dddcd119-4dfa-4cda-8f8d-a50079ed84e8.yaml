title: 'Eidolon Mesh Evolution: From Files to Living Knowledge Graph'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is evolving into a living knowledge organism, integrating file management,
  protein synthesis, and a connectome for semantic linking. It's moving beyond basic file processing
  to build a self-aware, interconnected system capable of complex reasoning and organic growth.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh is transitioning from a file-processing system to a self-evolving knowledge
    organism.
  - >-
    Core organelles (Watcher, Golgi, Connectome, Mitosis) are established, enabling robust data
    metabolism, privacy, and interconnectedness.
  - >-
    The Connectome facilitates semantic linking between 'proteins' (knowledge units), forming a
    graph-based 'tissue'.
  - >-
    The system is actively addressing schema mismatches with external knowledge formats (Copilot's
    capsules) to integrate richer semantic structures.
  - >-
    Future evolution paths include advanced querying, visualization (Dashboard), and the ability to
    ingest and integrate diverse knowledge formats (Protein Injection).
