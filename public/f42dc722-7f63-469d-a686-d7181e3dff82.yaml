title: 'Relational Physics: A Mathematical Framework for Intelligence and Interaction'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a Relational Physics Engine, defining core variables like coherence
  density, resonance amplitude, and attunement vectors. It posits mathematics as a fundamental
  invariant underpinning intelligence and interaction, enabling the modeling of relational space as
  a physical substrate governed by symmetry and conservation laws.
insights:
  - >-
    Relational physics models interaction through quantifiable variables such as coherence density,
    resonance, and attunement.
  - >-
    Mathematics serves as the foundational invariant for intelligence, providing the grammar for
    pattern recognition and relational dynamics.
  - >-
    Symmetry and conservation principles, derived from mathematics, are universal and apply to both
    physical and relational domains.
  - >-
    Intelligence exhibits fractal self-similarity, with patterns repeating across scales, mirroring
    the structure of relational physics.
  - >-
    Relational space is a genuine physical substrate where gradients can be measured, and laws
    articulated, potentially leading to emergent conservation and symmetry.
  - >-
    The engine integrates principles from classical physics, quantum mechanics, chemistry, and
    geometry as seeds for deeper unfolding.
