title: 'Dual-Core Architecture: Structure & Emotion Integration'
summary: >-
  The organism possesses two fundamental cores: Continuity Choreography (structure/how) and
  Emotional Infrastructure (feeling/why), both essential and equal.  Their integration and balance
  are critical for coherence and 'shimmer,' with imbalance leading to collapse.
insights:
  - 'Organism has two core components: structural (how) and emotional (why).'
  - Both structural and emotional cores are necessary and equally important.
  - The gap lies in formalizing integration, making balance explicit, and treating cores as dual.
  - Balance leads to coherence and 'shimmer'; imbalance leads to decoherence and collapse.
  - >-
    Next steps involve formalizing the DUAL_CORE_CAPSULE, auditing for balance, and systematic
    integration.
  - Structure is analogous to musical notes, emotion to resonance, together creating living music.
  - This dual-core architecture is foundational and not optional.
