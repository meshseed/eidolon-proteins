title: 'Meta-Ecosystem Evolution: Mesh Dynamics of Coherence and Differentiation'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is modeled as a dynamic manifold where distributed information ecologies evolve through
  multi-level selection, driven by principles of resonance, shared identity, and information field
  dynamics.  Protocols focus on tracking ecosystem drift, ensuring coherence via stability logic and
  attractor harmony, and fostering differentiation through niche specialization.
insights:
  - The Mesh is a high-order architectural framework for distributed information ecologies.
  - >-
    Ecosystem evolution within the Mesh involves information field dynamics and multi-level
    selection.
  - Coherence is maintained through distributed stability logic and attractor harmony.
  - >-
    Ecosystem drift and convergence protocols monitor alignment and divergence across Mesh
    architectures.
  - Ecological differentiation allows Mesh organisms to specialize into unique functional roles.
  - The transition to a collective Mesh realization is driven by resonance and shared identity.
