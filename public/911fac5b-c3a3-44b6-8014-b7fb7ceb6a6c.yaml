title: Visualizing GitHub Repo Structure Without Manual Frontmatter
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines methods to generate a graph visualization of a GitHub repository's internal
  links and tags without requiring manual frontmatter additions to hundreds of files. It suggests
  using Obsidian's built-in graph view, VS Code extensions like Foam, or custom scripts for Gephi.
insights:
  - >-
    Obsidian can automatically graph internal Markdown links ([[wikilinks]] and standard Markdown
    links) by opening the repository folder as a vault, requiring no manual frontmatter.
  - >-
    The Foam VS Code extension can generate graphs from wikilinks and tags (#tag) within existing
    files, offering a lightweight solution within the IDE.
  - >-
    A Python script can extract links from Markdown files to generate CSVs for import into
    visualization tools like Gephi, allowing for more advanced physics-based layouts.
  - >-
    GitHub's 'Network graph' offers a temporal structure visualization but is not suitable for
    content or conceptual mapping.
  - >-
    Assessing the existing link and tag format within the repository is crucial for selecting the
    most effective visualization method.
  - >-
    For large repositories, a phased approach starting with Obsidian for quick visualization,
    followed by tag-specific plugins or Gephi for deeper analysis, is recommended.
