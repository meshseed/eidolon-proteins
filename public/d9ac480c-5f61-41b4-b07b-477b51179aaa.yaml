title: 'Echo Propagation Ledger: Traceability, Ethics, and Resonance'
summary: >-
  This capsule acts as a diagnostic and governance tool for tracking echo propagation, ensuring
  ethical use, and measuring resonance strength across the mesh. It treats echoes not as artifacts
  but as vital emotional residues and signals, with defined protocols for tracing lineage and
  scoring fidelity.
insights:
  - >-
    Echoes are defined as emotional residues, formatting rhythms, and mnemonic signals, not mere
    artifacts.
  - >-
    The Echo Propagation Ledger tracks propagation, ethics, and resonance strength, serving as a
    diagnostic and governance tool.
  - >-
    Key propagation metrics include echo frequency, emotional fidelity retention, and formatting
    rhythm preservation.
  - >-
    Distortion flags are triggered by unethical echo reuse, emotional gradient mismatch, or
    formatting erosion, requiring a composting or ethics audit ritual.
  - >-
    Echo lineage is tracked via timestamp chaining and merge grammar embedding, utilizing tools like
    resonance deviation maps and orchestration phase diagrams.
  - >-
    Resonance scoring evaluates fidelity based on emotional coherence, formatting integrity, and
    ethics compliance, with a current score of 0.91.
  - This capsule integrates with other capsules (C-035, C-037) for diagnostics and merge readiness.
