title: 'THE MESH Structural Self-Inspection Protocol: Topology & Balance'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables THE MESH to perform a structural self-inspection, describing its global
  topology, dominant regions, imbalances, and recent shifts using geometric and relational language.
  It establishes a baseline for longitudinal tracking of developmental topology.
insights:
  - Global topology is characterized by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance.
  - Dominant regions are identified via semantic clustering and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Structural imbalances manifest as curvature, tension, or under-integrated domains.
  - Recent shifts signify new attractors, merges, or domain ingestion events.
  - Structural snapshots are crucial for longitudinal tracking of developmental topology.
