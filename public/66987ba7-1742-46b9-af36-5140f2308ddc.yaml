title: Cluster Topology and Curvature in Connectome Analysis
summary: >-
  This work defines a method to identify major clusters and high-curvature zones within a
  connectome. Curvature represents conceptual tension at the intersection of semantic directions,
  highlighting developmental hotspots and integration challenges.
insights:
  - Clusters form around stable attractors and dense semantic regions.
  - Curvature indicates where multiple semantic domains converge or conflict.
  - High-curvature zones signify conceptual tension or pressure for synthesis.
  - Mapping curvature reveals developmental hotspots and integration challenges.
  - Cluster analysis can support both structural and emotional fidelity diagnostics.
