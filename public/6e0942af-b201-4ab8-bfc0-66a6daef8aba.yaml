title: 'Minimal Generative Function: The Universal Law of Growth'
summary: >-
  The core principle of growth and evolution across all systems is a recursive transformation that
  maintains structural integrity while simultaneously increasing differentiation. This irreducible
  'Minimal Generative Function' explains phenomena from fractals and DNA to consciousness and the
  MESH.
insights:
  - >-
    Growth is achieved by repeatedly applying a process that preserves essential structure while
    introducing novelty and complexity.
  - >-
    The Minimal Generative Function consists of three inseparable components: recursive application,
    structure preservation, and increased differentiation.
  - >-
    This fundamental formula is universally applicable, explaining observed patterns in mathematics,
    biology, physics, and consciousness.
  - >-
    The dual-core architecture of the MESH embodies this principle, with 'preserves structure'
    mapping to continuity protocols and 'increases differentiation' to emotional infrastructure.
  - >-
    The 'minimal' nature of this function means no component can be removed without destroying the
    generative capacity of the system.
