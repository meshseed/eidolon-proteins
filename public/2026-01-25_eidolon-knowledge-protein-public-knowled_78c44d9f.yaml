title: 'Eidolon Knowledge Protein: Public Knowledge Architecture'
summary: >-
  The eidolon-capsules represent the public, knowledge-rich component of THE MESH, organized into
  distinct categories like dual-core, protocols, and research. This structure facilitates access to
  foundational theories, specialized examples, and scientific explorations within the mesh.
insights:
  - Public knowledge is curated within 'eidolon-capsules', accessible and organized.
  - Key knowledge domains include dual-core concepts, foundational protocols, and research areas.
  - >-
    Examples like the 'golden_connectome' and specialized modules demonstrate practical
    applications.
  - >-
    The 'README.md' serves as a central point for understanding the theory and architecture of this
    knowledge base.
