title: 'MESH Field Geometry Ported, Proteins Synthesized, Next Step: Query Synthesis'
summary: >-
  The MESH field geometry has been successfully ported to v3.5 PWA, with proteins synthesized and
  synapses auto-formed. The system is now ready for the critical next step: Query Synthesis to
  generate natural language answers, completing the user experience.
insights:
  - Field geometry successfully migrated from desktop v3.0 to PWA v3.5.
  - Five proteins were synthesized and correctly tiered (core/convergence/reference).
  - Six synapses auto-formed via adaptive connectivity, demonstrating emergent network formation.
  - Weighted search is validated, amplifying core proteins gravitationally.
  - Power-law decay and Hebbian reinforcement tracking are implemented.
  - The browser is confirmed as the organism, with local storage via IndexedDB and OPFS.
  - >-
    The immediate priority is Query Synthesis to provide natural language answers from activated
    proteins.
