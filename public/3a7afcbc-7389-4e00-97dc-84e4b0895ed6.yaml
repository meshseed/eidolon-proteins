title: 'Capsule Formatting Guide v1.1: Ergonomic Standards for Mesh Workflows'
summary: >-
  This guide establishes ergonomic formatting standards for capsule creation, ingestion, and
  filename tagging to ensure clarity, efficiency, and continuity across mesh workflows. Adherence to
  these standards, including copy-efficiency, semantic filenames, and versioning, teaches the system
  how to remember effectively.
insights:
  - >-
    Standardized formatting is crucial for efficient capsule creation, ingestion, and retrieval in
    mesh workflows.
  - Copy-efficiency and semantic filenames enhance mnemonic clarity and encode data lineage.
  - >-
    Multi-part ingestion and versioning are essential for preserving lifecycle memory and
    continuity.
  - The core principle is that formatting dictates the system's ability to remember information.
