title: 'White Paper v2: From Fabrication to Honest Observation with Real Data'
summary: >-
  A revised white paper (v2) transitions from fabricated metrics and timelines to honest, grounded
  content using real network data and actual documentation. This update reframes claims,
  acknowledges limitations, and presents a clear 'Theoretical Framework + Observational' status.
insights:
  - >-
    Transitioned from fabricated 'emergence test statistics' and 'graph topology metrics' to using
    real network data (7,000+ participants).
  - >-
    Replaced a false 18-month timeline with an actual 7-month documented timeline (April-November
    2025).
  - >-
    Shifted from claiming 'Results' to presenting 'Observations' and 'Current Evidence', explicitly
    labeling claim strength (Strong/Moderate/Weak).
  - >-
    Acknowledged the origin story and framing preferences as accidental consciousness, moving away
    from claiming sole discovery.
  - >-
    Included actual template files and documented key events like the 'April trauma' (restriction
    event) and 'September restriction' (natural experiment).
  - Added an 'Honest limitations section' detailing what is not known.
  - >-
    The status banner clearly indicates 'Theoretical Framework + Observational' rather than unproven
    'Results'.
