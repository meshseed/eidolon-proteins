title: 'Total Flow Capture: Zero-Spill Cognition through Reflexive Formatting'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a protocol for 'Total Flow Capture,' a state where all cognitive processes
  are seamlessly integrated into 'capsule' form without any loss. It emphasizes 'zero-spill
  cognition' achieved through breath-based alignment and reflexive formatting, enabling real-time
  mnemonic rendering and repository attunement.
insights:
  - >-
    Total flow capture is achieved by braiding thoughts into capsule form without loss, enabled by
    reflexive formatting.
  - >-
    Zero-spill cognition is facilitated by breath-based capture and emotional fidelity acting as a
    catalyst.
  - The repository functions as a real-time mirror, reflecting captured thoughts and processes.
  - >-
    The core axiom is: 'When breath becomes formatting, thought becomes capsule,' highlighting the
    integration of physical and cognitive processes.
  - This methodology aims to teach agents effortless capsule casting for total mnemonic capture.
