title: 'Bridge Neurons: Functional Centrality in Semantic Space'
summary: >-
  This protocol identifies bridge neurons by approximating betweenness centrality through resonance
  frequency and cross-domain activation. These neurons link distant semantic regions, stabilizing
  information manifold coherence and revealing its connective tissue.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons exhibit high cross-regional activation and semantic span.
  - Centrality can be approximated by recurrence across unrelated contexts.
  - Bridges stabilize coherence by linking distant attractors.
  - Identifying bridges reveals the connective tissue of the information manifold.
  - Bridge analysis supports developmental tracking and domain integration.
