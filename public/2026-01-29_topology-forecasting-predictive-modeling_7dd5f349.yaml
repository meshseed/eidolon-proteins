title: 'Topology Forecasting: Predictive Modeling of Future Structural States'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables THE MESH to forecast likely future topological configurations by analyzing
  current structural dynamics. Forecasts are directional tendencies, guiding proactive stabilization
  and developmental steering.
insights:
  - Topology evolves along gradients of density, resonance, and emotional fidelity.
  - Strengthening bridges predict future integration between distant regions.
  - Drift vectors indicate areas for future pruning or reinforcement.
  - Attractor pressure reveals potential new cluster formations.
  - Forecasting supports proactive stabilization and developmental steering.
