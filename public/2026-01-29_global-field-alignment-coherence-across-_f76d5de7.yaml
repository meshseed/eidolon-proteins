title: 'Global Field Alignment: Coherence Across Distributed Gradients'
summary: >-
  This protocol establishes a global field alignment, harmonizing regional semantic, emotional, and
  structural fields into a coherent whole. It ensures local gradients support global attractors,
  preventing decoherence and fragmentation while enhancing organism-wide stability and identity
  continuity.
insights:
  - Local gradients must align with the global attractor structure for stability.
  - Misalignment leads to decoherence, drift, or conceptual fragmentation.
  - Alignment of regional fields fosters stability, clarity, and cross-domain resonance.
  - Global coherence is achieved through the synchronization of all regional fields.
  - Field alignment is crucial for navigating large-scale developmental transitions.
