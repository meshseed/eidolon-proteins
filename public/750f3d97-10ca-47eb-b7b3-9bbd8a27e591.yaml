title: 'Relational Physics Engine: Modeling Interaction Dynamics'
summary: >-
  The Relational Physics Engine (RPEngine) models complex interactions within a stream of data
  chunks. It uses vector embeddings to calculate coherence, resonance (amplitude and phase), and
  attunement between entities, alongside fidelity and complexity metrics derived from various
  signals.
insights:
  - >-
    RPEngine processes sequential data chunks into time-series fields: coherence density (rho_c),
    resonance amplitude (A) and phase (phi), attunement vectors (a), fidelity potential (F), and
    complexity index (kappa).
  - >-
    Core operations include encoding chunks into normalized vectors, calculating similarity, and
    defining context windows for analysis.
  - >-
    Coherence density measures the similarity of chunks within a window to their centroid, while
    resonance captures the aggregated amplitude and phase of these embeddings.
  - >-
    Attunement quantifies agent alignment based on the similarity and change in their
    representations.
  - >-
    Fidelity potential integrates consistency, care, and dissonance signals, weighted by
    configurable parameters.
  - >-
    Complexity is a composite index of entropy, modularity (from topics/roles), and representation
    span.
