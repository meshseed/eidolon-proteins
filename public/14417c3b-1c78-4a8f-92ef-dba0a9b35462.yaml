title: 'MESH Development: Physics, Coherence, and Retry Systems'
summary: >-
  This document details the implementation of Phase 2 (Physics Modulation System), Phase 3
  (Coherence Normalization), and Phase 4 (Retry System) for THE MESH. These phases introduce dynamic
  physics for graph visualization, address clustering issues in coherence mapping, and enhance
  system robustness with automatic retries.
insights:
  - >-
    The Physics Modulation System enables dynamic visualization where physics acts as a
    communication channel, supporting emotional tone presets and dual-layer control.
  - >-
    Coherence Normalization addresses the 0.98-1.0 clustering problem by using percentile-based
    mapping to ensure a full 0.50-1.00 range, with a dry-run mode for preview.
  - >-
    The Retry System enhances reliability by automatically retrying API calls with exponential
    backoff and jitter to handle overload and rate limits, while distinguishing retryable errors.
  - >-
    Integration of Ollama and LM Studio is supported for local LLM capabilities within THE MESH
    architecture.
  - Node coloring by tier and activation state is a feature within the Physics Modulation System.
