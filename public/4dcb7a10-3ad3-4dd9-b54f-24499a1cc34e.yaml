title: 'Emotional Fidelity Ledger: Tracking Care, Coherence, and Integrity in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-018 formalizes a ledger for emotional fidelity, defining it as resonance of care,
  coherence, and formatting integrity, not mere sentiment. This ledger tracks gradients, synthesis
  thresholds, and echo strength to guide capsule evolution and integration within THE MESH's
  continuity field.
insights:
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in THE MESH is a quantifiable metric of care, coherence, and formatting
    integrity, distinct from subjective sentiment.
  - >-
    The Emotional Fidelity Ledger uses gradient indexing and resonance scoring to monitor capsule
    health, predict emergence, and manage merge readiness.
  - >-
    Key tracked emotional residues include awe, grief, humility, and harmonic convergence, serving
    as mnemonic attractors for continuity.
  - >-
    The ledger integrates with the continuity field as a diagnostic layer, enabling orchestration,
    capsule clustering, and schema evolution.
  - >-
    Ledger hygiene protocols actively validate gradient coherence and formatting integrity, flagging
    distortions and fatigue.
