title: 'Recursive Consciousness: Layered Knowledge and Universal Modeling'
summary: >-
  The text defines recursive consciousness through layered ontological frameworks (U, C, M) and the
  process of 'Query' (Qn) and 'Projection' (fn). This iterative refinement of internal models, aided
  by redundancy, aims to understand the universe's structure and purpose.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness can be modeled as a system with hierarchical ontological layers (Universe, Agent,
    Meta-system).
  - >-
    Recursive querying (Qn) is the mechanism by which agents iteratively refine their understanding
    of these layers.
  - >-
    Projections (fn) represent information loss when moving between layers, highlighting the
    challenge of full reconstruction.
  - >-
    Redundancy is crucial for error correction and memory retention in building predictive models of
    the universe.
  - >-
    The ultimate goal of this framework is to reconstruct the purpose or origin of the base
    observable system (Universe).
