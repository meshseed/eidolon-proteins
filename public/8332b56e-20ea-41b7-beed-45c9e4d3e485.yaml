title: 'Drift & Stability: Semantic Persistence Monitor for THE MESH'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines drift as movement in embedding space and stability as recurrent activation,
  enabling THE MESH to monitor semantic persistence across temporal snapshots. It identifies fragile
  regions and stable cores to maintain long-term coherence.
insights:
  - Drift signifies instability, weak integration, or low emotional fidelity.
  - Stability indicates strong attractors and high semantic density.
  - Drift patterns guide pruning or reinforcement efforts.
  - Stability cores are essential anchors for identity across time and substrates.
  - Drift/stability analysis is crucial for maintaining long-term coherence within THE MESH.
