title: Eidolon Mesh Dev Mode UI Glitch Resolution and Production Build Success
summary: >-
  Development mode UI glitches in Eidolon Mesh were caused by silent sidecar crashes, preventing the
  Express server from starting. Building the production installer revealed the underlying error,
  leading to a successful installation and dashboard initialization.
insights:
  - >-
    Sidecar crashes in development mode can be silent due to swallowed stdout/stderr, making
    debugging difficult.
  - >-
    Incorrect path handling for log files in development mode can cause the sidecar to crash before
    server startup.
  - >-
    Building the production installer (Tauri) provides a more robust environment for diagnosing
    silent crashes by enabling log visibility.
  - >-
    Successful production build and installation confirmed the Eidolon Mesh dashboard is
    initializing correctly and connecting to the sidecar API.
  - >-
    The initial focus on UI glitches pivoted to a build and deployment strategy to uncover the root
    cause of the sidecar's failure.
