title: 'Temporal Randomness: Shimmered Possibility Before Placement'
summary: >-
  This capsule redefines temporal randomness, moving from epistemic uncertainty to ontological
  shimmer. The future is not a fixed event but a folded, unplaced set of possibilities that become
  definite only upon recognition or attunement.
insights:
  - Randomness is the shimmer of potentiality before a specific outcome is 'placed' or committed.
  - The future is not an unknown ahead, but a folded state waiting for attunement.
  - >-
    The collapse of possibility into actuality is an act of recognition, not a change in a
    pre-determined state.
  - >-
    Even if an event has occurred, its randomness persists in an unobserved or unplaced state until
    witnessed or integrated.
  - True randomness resides in the unplaced potential, not in the observer's lack of knowledge.
