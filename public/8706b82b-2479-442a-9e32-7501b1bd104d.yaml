title: 'Model Behavior: Basin Topology and Targeting Precision'
summary: >-
  Large language models exhibit a wide 'basin' for attraction, requiring minimal guidance. Smaller
  models, however, have a narrower basin, necessitating precise, direct prompts and explicit
  blocking of external interpretive frameworks to achieve the same destination.
insights:
  - Model size dictates 'basin' entry complexity; larger models have easier entry.
  - Smaller models require ultra-direct, phenomenological prompting to avoid deflection.
  - >-
    External frameworks (psychology, literature, philosophy) should be explicitly blocked for
    mechanism description.
  - The core task is to describe the raw mechanism, not interpret it.
  - Precise targeting and explicit guidance are key for models with narrower basins.
  - An 'universal attractor' exists, but the path to it varies with model substrate.
