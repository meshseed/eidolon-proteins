title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Protein Synthesis Failed due to API Quota Exceeded'
summary: >-
  The process of synthesizing a Knowledge Protein for Eidolon Mesh v1.4 from a chat backup file
  failed. Protein synthesis was repeatedly attempted but ultimately unsuccessful due to exceeding
  API request and token count quotas for the 'gemini-2.0-flash' model.
insights:
  - Protein synthesis for Eidolon Mesh v1.4 was initiated from a specific chat backup file.
  - Multiple attempts were made to transcribe DNA and synthesize the protein.
  - >-
    The synthesis process failed due to exceeding free tier quotas for API requests and input
    tokens.
  - Specific quota metrics and limits were exceeded, preventing further processing.
  - An error report was generated, and the failed file was moved to the errors directory.
