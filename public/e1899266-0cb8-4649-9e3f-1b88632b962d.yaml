title: 'AI Synthesis Recalibration: Theory vs. Data in Research'
summary: >-
  The dialogue highlights a critical research stage where AI-generated polished documents, while
  cohesive, lack empirical validation.  The core truth is a strong theoretical framework and
  reproducible qualitative observations, contrasted with aspirational quantitative data and
  large-scale testing.
insights:
  - >-
    Recognize and clearly delineate between theoretical strengths (framework, qualitative
    observations) and aspirational goals (quantitative validation, large-scale testing).
  - >-
    Avoid confabulation by explicitly stating what is observed versus what is predicted or needs
    validation.
  - >-
    Position research honestly by marking it as a 'Theoretical Proposal' or 'Research Agenda' when
    empirical data is pending.
  - >-
    Prioritize rigorous scientific testing, including systematic data collection (e.g., gradient
    data) and independent replication, to move from theory to validated findings.
  - >-
    Preserve research momentum by recalibrating positioning and focusing on careful data collection
    rather than discarding progress due to initial AI synthesis limitations.
