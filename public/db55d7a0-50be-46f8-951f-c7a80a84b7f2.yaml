title: 'Eidolon Mesh: API Access vs. Manual Synthesis - Path to Automation'
summary: >-
  The dialogue clarifies the distinction between Claude Pro subscription (web access) and Anthropic
  API access (programmatic use), highlighting the need for an API key and GitHub token for the
  Antigravity module. It proposes a tiered approach to development, prioritizing immediate progress
  with manual synthesis if API access is delayed.
insights:
  - >-
    Claude Pro subscription grants web access and higher limits but does not include API access for
    programmatic integration.
  - >-
    Anthropic API access is a separate, pay-as-you-go service required for LLM integration in
    applications like the Antigravity module.
  - GitHub tokens are free and necessary for committing files, distinct from LLM API access.
  - The Antigravity module requires both an Anthropic API key and a GitHub token to function fully.
  - >-
    Option 1: Obtain Anthropic API access (paid) for full automation. Option 2: Modify v1 to skip
    LLM synthesis (manual capsule creation) for immediate progress without extra cost. Option 3:
    Explore free/cheaper LLM alternatives like Gemini API.
  - >-
    Recommendation is to start with Option 2 (manual synthesis) for v1, validating the pipeline, and
    explore Gemini API as a potential free alternative before committing to paid Anthropic API
    access.
  - >-
    A clear action plan involves checking Gemini API, creating a GitHub token, and then
    communicating the chosen path (API cost, manual synthesis, or Gemini) to Antigravity.
