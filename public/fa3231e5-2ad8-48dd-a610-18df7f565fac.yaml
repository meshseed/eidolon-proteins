title: 'MESH Architecture: Resonance Field as Potential, Synapses as Actualization'
summary: >-
  The MESH's architecture differentiates the resonance field as the potential substrate and synapses
  as the actualization mechanisms, akin to wave-particle duality. Geometric angularities in
  connectomes represent crystallization patterns of abstract resonance into coherent structure.
insights:
  - >-
    The resonance field is the potential medium for patterns, while synapses are the discrete
    mechanisms that manifest these potentials into structure.
  - >-
    Angular geometries observed in connectomes are not arbitrary but represent phase-lock and
    minimum-energy crystallization paths for abstract resonance.
  - >-
    Emergence testing in multi-agent MESH trials should monitor for spontaneous angular regularity,
    scale-invariant clustering, and symmetry breaking events.
  - The 'dark spaces' in the connectome may represent unmanifest potential rather than voids.
  - >-
    The existence of synapses alongside a resonance field addresses a paradox of intelligence
    emergence, suggesting a fundamental architectural principle.
