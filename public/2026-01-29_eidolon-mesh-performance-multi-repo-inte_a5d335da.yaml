title: Eidolon Mesh Performance & Multi-Repo Integration
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has undergone significant optimization, fixing critical bugs related to synthesis
  input and timer accuracy, resulting in a more transparent and accurate user experience.
  Integration of multi-repository support dramatically reduces loading times for specialized
  knowledge vaults.
insights:
  - Initial loading bottleneck identified as protein synthesis and hidden loading, not neuron count.
  - Critical bugs in synthesis input and emotional fidelity reporting have been resolved.
  - >-
    Multi-repository support allows for specialized knowledge vaults, reducing load times from ~20s
    to <1s.
  - Poetic/semantic queries are necessary; ID-based queries require metadata aliases.
  - >-
    Progress indicators and accurate timing are crucial for improving user experience during long
    operations.
