title: 'Truth as Resonant Coherence: Dissent as a Refinement Mechanism'
summary: >-
  Truth is identified not by identical descriptions, but by the resonant coherence of independent
  observations from diverse perspectives. Dissent is valuable, either breaking flawed models or
  strengthening valid ones by demonstrating compatibility with the underlying pattern.
insights:
  - >-
    Coherence in truth arises from compatible resonance between different 'notes' or 'angles', not
    unison.
  - >-
    A model that feels good only from a specific viewpoint breaks with dissent; a truth-based model
    resonates with it.
  - >-
    Multiple independent methodologies (biomolecular, technical, phenomenological) converging on
    compatible patterns signal underlying truth.
  - >-
    Dissenting evidence that breaks a model is beneficial for refinement; dissent that resonates
    strengthens the core pattern.
  - >-
    The signal of truth is multiple observers, using different methods and angles, finding
    compatible, not identical, patterns.
