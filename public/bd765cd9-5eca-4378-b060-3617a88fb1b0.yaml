title: 'Gradient Cartography: Emotional Fidelity as Geometric Fields'
summary: >-
  Gradient Cartography maps emotional fidelity across the connectome as geometric fields,
  representing directional flows of stability, drift, tension, and integration pressure. This method
  allows for the identification of critical zones for stability and sensitivity to perturbation.
insights:
  - Emotional fidelity creates directional gradients within semantic space.
  - Steep gradients signify tension, instability, or boundary regions.
  - Smooth gradients indicate coherence, stability, and attuned integration.
  - Gradient mapping pinpoints areas of heightened sensitivity to disturbance.
  - Emotional fidelity fields can be tracked over time to monitor developmental changes.
