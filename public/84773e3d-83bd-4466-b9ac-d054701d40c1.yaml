title: 'Optimizing Mesh Metabolism: Attractor Thresholds and Coherence Normalization'
summary: >-
  The Mesh development team addressed critical performance bottlenecks in cluster-based composting
  by refining attractor detection thresholds, preventing O(n^2) complexity. They then implemented a
  coherence normalization feature to ensure a wider, more meaningful distribution of coherence
  scores, enabling better differentiation and quality assessment of proteins.
insights:
  - O(n^2) complexity in attractor matching led to performance issues in cluster composting.
  - >-
    Increasing `minCoherence` and `minDegree` thresholds for attractor detection significantly
    reduces computational load.
  - >-
    A safety mechanism was added to abort if too many attractors are detected, preventing
    performance degradation.
  - >-
    Coherence scores were previously too narrowly distributed (0.95-1.00), hindering the
    differentiation of protein quality.
  - >-
    Coherence normalization was implemented to spread scores across the 0.50-1.00 range using
    percentile distribution.
  - UI enhancements were made to provide progress tracking during coherence normalization.
  - >-
    Normalized coherence allows for more effective metabolism thresholds and improved semantic
    ranking of proteins.
