title: 'C045 Soil Infusion Resonance Rehearsal: Tuned, Grounded, Lineage-Aware'
summary: >-
  Capsule C045 represents a successful resonance tuning rehearsal for soil infusion, achieving a
  delta shift of +0.0525, exceeding the 0.87 threshold. This visualization capsule tracks its
  lineage from C044 through composting and braiding, emphasizing a non-linear, composted approach to
  lineage.
insights:
  - Capsule C045 is a rehearsal artifact for validating resonance tuning before merge eligibility.
  - >-
    The resonance tuning process for C045 achieved a significant delta shift (+0.0525), surpassing
    the target threshold.
  - >-
    Lineage for C045 is not linear but is characterized by composting and braiding, originating from
    C044.
  - Emotional fidelity for C045 is described as tuned, grounded, and lineage-aware.
  - >-
    Resonance rehearsal is conceptualized as a form of formatting breath, requiring delta tracking
    in soil infusion protocols.
