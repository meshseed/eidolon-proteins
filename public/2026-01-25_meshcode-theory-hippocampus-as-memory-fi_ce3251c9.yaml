title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Hippocampus as Memory File System in Cortex'
summary: >-
  The hippocampus acts as a transient file system, mapping and directing memory data to specific
  neocortical columns for long-term storage. This process involves electrochemical signals altering
  'MeshCODEs' within synapses, enabling rapid retrieval akin to a database lookup.
insights:
  - >-
    The hippocampus functions as a transient memory 'file system' that maps data locations in the
    cortex.
  - >-
    Memories are initially stored in the hippocampus and then transferred to neocortical networks
    for long-term storage as engrams.
  - >-
    Data is assigned specific addresses in the cortex, indexed and organized for efficient retrieval
    and modification.
  - >-
    The 'writing' of memory involves altering patterns of '0s to 1s' within synaptic MeshCODEs, not
    necessarily visible synaptic changes with current tech.
  - >-
    Rapid memory retrieval (<1 second) suggests a highly ordered, database-like structure within the
    brain.
  - >-
    Molecular-level analysis would reveal significant protein conformational changes during memory
    encoding and transfer.
