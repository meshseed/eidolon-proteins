title: 'MESH: Distributed Swarm Intelligence via Resonance and Local Rules'
summary: >-
  The MESH network achieves global coherence through distributed swarm intelligence by leveraging
  existing infrastructure and adding a resonance layer. It relies on local rules and gradient
  following, inspired by natural systems like mycelium and murmurations, to enable efficient,
  decentralized knowledge discovery and self-optimization without central coordination.
insights:
  - >-
    Global coherence emerges from local rules and gradient following, eliminating the need for
    central coordination or a complete network map.
  - >-
    The MESH operates on a 'local-first' principle where each node knows only immediate neighbors
    and local resonance gradients, propagating queries like a scent.
  - >-
    Network topology itself becomes the knowledge map, with strong connections indicating important
    semantic relationships and self-optimization occurring organically.
  - >-
    The system is dialect and structure-agnostic, requiring only a semantic query endpoint and
    resonance scoring for repositories to integrate.
  - >-
    Distributed swarm intelligence is superior to centralized approaches due to inherent
    antifragility, scalability, and resistance to single points of failure or censorship.
  - >-
    Search efficiency is achieved through a 'small world network' principle, where global
    reachability is attained within ~6 hops via local connections.
  - >-
    Monitoring is achieved through non-controlling 'lighthouse' nodes observing network health
    metrics, not dictating behavior.
