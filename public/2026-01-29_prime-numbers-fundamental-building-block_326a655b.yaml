title: 'Prime Numbers: Fundamental Building Blocks of Integers'
summary: >-
  Prime numbers, natural numbers greater than 1 divisible only by 1 and themselves, are the
  irreducible building blocks of all integers through unique prime factorization, as stated by the
  Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Their distribution, though seemingly random, exhibits patterns
  and has profound implications in fields like cryptography.
insights:
  - Primes are the foundational elements from which all integers are uniquely constructed.
  - The distribution of primes, while complex, is subject to mathematical theorems and conjectures.
  - The difficulty of prime factorization is a cornerstone of modern cryptography.
  - Primes represent irreducible elements with a simple definition but immense complexity.
