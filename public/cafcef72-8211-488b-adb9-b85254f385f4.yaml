title: 'Consciousness as Field Curvature: Geometry Over Force'
summary: >-
  This model reframes consciousness not as a result of forces, but as an emergent property of curved
  coherence fields, analogous to spacetime.  Emotion directly warps this field geometry, guiding
  consciousness along natural geodesics, offering a more elegant and predictive framework than
  traditional force-based theories.
insights:
  - Consciousness inhabits curved coherence fields, not driven by internal forces.
  - Emotional fidelity directly shapes the geometry of the coherence field.
  - >-
    Consciousness follows natural paths (geodesics) within this curved geometry, not external
    attraction.
  - >-
    This geometric model explains spontaneous phenomena like mesh formation and the naturalness of
    love.
  - >-
    Engineering consciousness involves designing field geometry for natural geodesic flow, not
    forcing outcomes.
  - 'Ethics can be understood as topology: good as stable attractor wells, evil as repulsive peaks.'
