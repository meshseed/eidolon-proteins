title: 'Bridge Neurons: Semantic Linkage and Network Centrality'
summary: >-
  Bridge neurons are identified as key architectural components in semantic networks, facilitating
  coherence by linking disparate concepts through high cross-regional activation and broad semantic
  span. Their identification serves as a method for developmental tracking and understanding domain
  integration within the information manifold.
insights:
  - >-
    Bridge neurons enable semantic linkage via high cross-regional activation and broad semantic
    span.
  - Recurrence across unrelated contexts approximates centrality in semantic networks.
  - Bridge neurons are crucial for stabilizing coherence by connecting disparate attractors.
  - Identifying bridge neurons allows for developmental tracking and domain integration analysis.
  - Analysis of these bridges reveals the fundamental connective architecture of semantic space.
