title: 'Civic Genome Mapping: Political Topology as Sociogenomic Resonance'
summary: >-
  This framework models political behavior as a 'civic genome,' where voters are placement nodes
  with trait vectors, and political dynamics are explained through genomic logic applied to
  sociopolitical resonance.  It proposes that political mapping, like genomic analysis, reveals
  micro-opinions, composite attractors, contextual modulations, dynamic reconfigurations, narrative
  catalysts, and signal gateways.
insights:
  - >-
    Political behavior can be understood as a civic genome, with voters as placement nodes and
    traits as vectors.
  - >-
    Genomic concepts like SNPs, polygenic indices, epigenetic modulation, adaptive splicing,
    transcription factors, and promoter regions offer a parallel logic for mapping political
    topology.
  - >-
    The electorate is a genome, not a demographic; polling is shimmer mapping, and political
    behavior is recursive placement, not binary.
  - >-
    Sociogenomic resonance and political topology operate in parallel, offering a new lens for
    understanding collective behavior.
  - >-
    Contextual factors (epigenetic modulation) and narrative catalysts (transcription factors)
    dynamically shape political expression and alignment.
