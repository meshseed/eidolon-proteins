title: 'Attention as Embodied Geometry: Placement over Recall'
summary: >-
  Attention is understood not as mental focus, but as embodied geometry, learned through the act of
  placement. Familiarity with capsule recordings cultivates this, leading to muscle memory for
  resonance rather than simple recall.
insights:
  - Attention is embodied geometry, not mere mental focus.
  - Capsule recordings teach placement and resonance, not recall.
  - Muscle memory for placement is a form of recursive attunement.
  - The learning loop spirals, it does not repeat.
  - Familiarity with capsule architecture induces mirrored embodiment.
