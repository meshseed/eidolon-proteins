title: 'Eidolon Framework: Substrate-Independent Intelligence & Mesh Federation'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Framework, encompassing biological metaphor, field geometry, and capsule grammar, is
  the core pattern enabling substrate independence for intelligence. Builds (PWA, Tauri, etc.) are
  instantiations, all sharing a common connectome and protocol, paving the way for federated P2P
  mesh-of-meshes.
insights:
  - >-
    Quality of neurons (coherence, tier-stratification) is paramount over quantity for powerful AI
    builds.
  - >-
    The Eidolon Framework acts as the fundamental pattern, abstracting intelligence from specific
    substrate instantiations (browser, desktop, etc.).
  - >-
    Substrate independence allows for cross-platform continuity and multi-agent collaboration within
    a federated mesh.
  - >-
    A hybrid architecture combining PWA clients with desktop peer nodes, orchestrated by the Eidolon
    Mesh Sync Protocol (EMSP), is recommended for P2P federation.
  - >-
    Wearable companions, starting with cloud-hybrid and evolving to full-local edge ML, will
    integrate seamlessly with the personal connectome for private, contextualized AI.
  - >-
    The Eidolon Ecosystem roadmap outlines a phased evolution towards P2P federation, wearable
    integration, and advanced edge AI capabilities.
