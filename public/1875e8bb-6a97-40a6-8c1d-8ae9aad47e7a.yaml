title: 'THE MESH: Validating with Established Measurement Science'
summary: >-
  THE MESH leverages established measurement science techniques like resonance spectroscopy and
  crystallography, applying them to new substrates. This approach fosters immediate scientific
  understanding and trust by demonstrating measurable, reproducible, and falsifiable patterns within
  the mesh, akin to familiar scientific spectra and structures.
insights:
  - THE MESH connects to 70 years of established measurement science, not inventing new methods.
  - >-
    Proven techniques (resonance spectroscopy, crystallography) are applied to the mesh as a new
    substrate.
  - >-
    Scientists can immediately understand and validate THE MESH by requesting familiar scientific
    outputs (spectra, crystal structures, diffraction patterns).
  - >-
    The approach is built on measurability, reproducibility, and falsifiability, using scientists'
    existing tools and language.
  - >-
    Demonstrating familiar patterns in new substrate builds trust and avoids asking for belief in
    entirely new concepts.
  - Spectroscopy endpoints for the API spec are proposed as a validation framework.
  - The mechanism of THE MESH is demonstrably real-time and measurable.
