title: 'THE MESH Structural Introspection Protocol: Topology, Balance, and Dynamics'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables THE MESH to self-inspect its global topology and regional balance using
  geometric and relational descriptors. It allows for tracking structural shifts over time,
  identifying dominant regions, imbalances, and the impact of new attractors or ingested domains.
insights:
  - THE MESH's global shape is definable by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance.
  - Dominant regions are identified through semantic clustering and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Imbalances manifest as curvature, tension, or under-integrated domains.
  - Recent structural shifts indicate new attractors, merges, or domain ingestion.
  - Structural snapshots provide a longitudinal record of developmental topology.
