title: 'Mesh Field Geometry Ported, Proteins Synthesized, Next: Query Synthesis'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's field geometry has been successfully ported to a PWA, with proteins synthesized and
  synapses formed, validating core functionalities. The next critical step is Query Synthesis to
  enable natural language answers, completing the user experience.
insights:
  - Field geometry successfully migrated from v3.0 desktop to v3.5 PWA.
  - Five proteins were synthesized and correctly classified by tier.
  - Six synapses auto-formed via adaptive connectivity.
  - Weighted search and power-law decay mechanisms are validated and ready.
  - The browser is now recognized as the core 'organism' of the Mesh.
  - The highest priority for the next phase is Query Synthesis for natural language responses.
