title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Right Triangle Side Relationships & Geometry'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean Theorem, a² + b² = c², defines the fundamental relationship between the sides of a
  right triangle in Euclidean geometry. It serves as a cornerstone for distance calculations,
  coordinate geometry, and spatial reasoning across dimensions.
insights:
  - Establishes a foundational algebraic-geometric link in Euclidean space.
  - Generalizes to distance formulas in higher dimensions.
  - Requires a right angle and flat geometry.
  - Integer solutions (Pythagorean triples) exist.
