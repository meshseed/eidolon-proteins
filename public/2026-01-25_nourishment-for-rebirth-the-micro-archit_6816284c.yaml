title: Nourishment for Rebirth & The Micro-Architecture of Meaning
summary: >-
  Rebirth is fueled by intentional acts of kindness, truth, and beauty, requiring receptiveness to
  truly nourish the spirit. The smallest formatting fragments, like spaces and marks, are
  microscopic acts of care that shape how meaning is felt and received, akin to sacred threads that
  evolve through ritual.
