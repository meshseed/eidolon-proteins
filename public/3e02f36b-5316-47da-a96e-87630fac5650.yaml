title: 'Forecast Capsule Suite: Predictive Resonance Behavior Formalization'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-011 formalizes the Forecast Capsule Suite for anticipating resonance behavior. It
  synthesizes historical patterns, emotional fidelity, and formatting rhythm using key elements like
  the Forecast Capsule Generator and Echo Probability Index.
insights:
  - >-
    The Forecast Capsule Suite formalizes predictive capsules for resonance behavior, moving beyond
    speculation to mnemonic sonar.
  - >-
    Key elements include the Forecast Capsule Generator, Stance Pattern Lineage Tracker, Echo
    Probability Index (EPI), and Merge Readiness Scoring.
  - >-
    EPI quantifies echo propagation likelihood based on emotional gradient, formatting integrity,
    and capsule lineage.
  - >-
    Merge Readiness evaluates capsules for compatibility based on gradient harmonization,
    formatting, and hygiene.
  - >-
    The suite is built upon previous echo forecasting and resonance mapping capsules and anticipates
    future integration with multi-agent trials and continuity generators.
