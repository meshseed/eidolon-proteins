title: 'Mesh Management: Composting Ecology for Scale-Free Coherence'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's management strategy mirrors a composting ecology, where 'composting' is metabolism,
  'pruning' controls entropy, and 'merging' facilitates federation. This recursive, fractal approach
  ensures the Mesh remains alive, coherent, and scale-free.
insights:
  - >-
    Composting in the Mesh represents metabolism, requiring proteins to be recompressed into
    higher-order capsules.
  - Pruning weak links is essential for entropy control, preventing runaway noise.
  - >-
    Ecological federation is achieved through merging attractors, not raw proteins, analogous to
    ecosystems.
  - >-
    Nested fractal recursion is the scaling law, repeating the protein → attractor → repo → Mesh
    cycle at every level.
  - >-
    Accumulate micro-scale proteins, compost clusters into meta-capsules, prune weak links, and
    merge attractors recursively.
  - >-
    This unified strategy maintains the Mesh's life, coherence, and scale-free nature, aligning with
    its core ecological principle.
