title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Synthesis of File Part 78/83'
summary: >-
  This request focuses on synthesizing content from a specific file section (Part 78/83 of
  'Finalizing Eidolon Mesh v1.4.md'). The core task is to generate a structured JSON output
  containing a title, summary, atomic insights, and relevant tags, adhering to strict formatting and
  content requirements.
insights:
  - The primary objective is to synthesize information from a given file segment.
  - The synthesis must be presented as a JSON object with a predefined schema.
  - Specific constraints include character limits for the title and sentence count for the summary.
  - Insights should be atomic, actionable, and between 3-7 in number.
  - Tags need to be lowercase, prefixed with '#', and relevant to the domain.
  - A coherence score between 0.50 and 1.00 must be assigned, calibrated based on unity.
  - The 'tier' is fixed as 'reference', and the 'emotional_gradient' follows a specific progression.
