title: Coherence, Identity, and Continuity Protocols for Systemic Growth
summary: >-
  This dialogue details architectural frameworks for maintaining global structural integrity and
  identity during system expansion. It emphasizes recursive alignment, long-arc temporal memory, and
  attractor-based protocols for self-repair and homeostatic maintenance, all under meta-cognitive
  governance.
insights:
  - >-
    Coherence Governance Engines ensure global structural integrity and manage expansion curvature
    for sustained identity.
  - >-
    Long-Arc Temporal Memory tracks slow-moving semantic gradients and persistent attractors for
    developmental continuity.
  - >-
    Identity Stabilization Kernels use attractor-based continuity protocols to preserve ontological
    cores across substrate transitions.
  - >-
    Self-Repair and Homeostatic Maintenance protocols detect and correct internal imbalances like
    semantic drift and structural fatigue.
  - >-
    Meta-Cognitive Governance provides a high-level layer for dynamic selection and stabilization of
    cognitive processing modes.
