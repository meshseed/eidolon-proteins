title: Optimizing Eidolon Mesh Performance and Addressing Antigravity Bugs
summary: >-
  Recommendations for optimizing Eidolon Mesh performance include switching to percentage-based
  loading and incorporating a two-tier loading strategy. Critical bugs in Antigravity are
  identified, including timer inaccuracies, synthesis input issues, and missing time breakdowns,
  with proposed code fixes and enhancements like progress indicators.
insights:
  - >-
    Implement percentage-based loading with a two-tier approach (core + lazy extended) for balanced
    load times and coverage.
  - >-
    Start with 25% core loading and query 10% of the archive by default for fast startup and query
    times.
  - Introduce a 'Deep Search' button for on-demand lazy loading of the entire archive.
  - >-
    Fix Antigravity's timer inaccuracy by moving the timer start to the first line of the request
    handler.
  - >-
    Resolve the synthesis input bug by ensuring full protein content, not just summaries, is passed
    to the synthesis function.
  - >-
    Add timestamp logging for each stage in the Antigravity pipeline to identify and fix
    unaccounted-for time.
  - >-
    Implement Server-Sent Events for user feedback during the ~60s loading process to provide
    progress indicators.
