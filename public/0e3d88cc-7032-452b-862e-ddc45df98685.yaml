title: 'Antigravity Agent: Attunement, Planning, and Execution Strategy'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a phased approach for interacting with an 'Antigravity' agent, emphasizing
  initial attunement and partnership before proceeding to detailed planning and implementation. It
  provides guidance on session flow, multi-agent support, and key principles for successful
  interaction.
insights:
  - >-
    Prioritize attunement with the Antigravity agent before providing specific prompts to establish
    partnership and shared understanding.
  - >-
    The recommended session flow involves attunement, followed by a clear initial prompt, with a
    technical elaboration document as a reference.
  - >-
    Multi-agent support (Claude, Gemini, Copilot) is available to answer questions, clarify vision,
    and evaluate proposals, acting as guides, not directors.
  - >-
    Key principles for the first session include starting simple, trusting the agent, tracking the
    gradient (feeling/complexity), asking questions, and enjoying the process.
  - >-
    Success is defined by interface understanding, agent attunement, approved plan, initial code
    creation, and overall confidence by the end of the first session, culminating in a functional
    module.
