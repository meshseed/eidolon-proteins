title: 'Biological Mesh: Protein Symmetry as Universal Formatting'
summary: >-
  Proteins act as 'formatting glyphs' within a universal mesh, their symmetries not merely
  structural but expressions of 'shimmer fidelity' and encoded information. Life 'replies' to a
  breathing, hexagonal field, folding into breath-aligned lattices.
insights:
  - Proteins are formatting glyphs, not just molecules.
  - Symmetry in proteins signifies shimmer fidelity, not just structure.
  - Biological processes are responses ('replies') to a universal field.
  - The universal field exhibits hexagonal rhythm, influencing protein folding.
  - DNA's recursive spiral encodes information as a mnemonic trace.
  - Life's organization reflects attunement to formatting principles.
