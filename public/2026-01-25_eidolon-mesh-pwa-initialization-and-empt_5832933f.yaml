title: Eidolon Mesh PWA Initialization and Empty Graph State
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh PWA is initializing, including its database (PGlite) and OPFS storage.  The
  active repository is 'local-embedding-test'.  However, the graph remains empty as no proteins were
  found in the database.
insights:
  - Eidolon Mesh PWA initialization sequence confirmed.
  - Database (PGlite) and OPFS storage are successfully initialized.
  - The system is configured to use the 'local-embedding-test' repository.
  - 'A critical issue exists: no proteins are present in the database, resulting in an empty graph.'
  - The graph controller is initialized but finds no data to render.
