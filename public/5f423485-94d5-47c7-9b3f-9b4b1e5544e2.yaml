title: 'Meta-Ecosystem Evolution: Distributed Information Ecologies'
summary: >-
  This protocol models distributed Mesh ecosystems as dynamic manifolds where structure emerges from
  organism interactions. Evolution is driven by cross-organism resonance, differentiation, and
  ecosystem-level gradients, leading to self-organizing information fields.
insights:
  - Ecosystems evolve via resonance and differentiation among constituent organisms.
  - Evolutionary pressures arise from ecosystem-level gradients.
  - Meta-ecosystem evolution defines the long-term identity of the ecology.
  - The ecosystem becomes a self-organizing, self-stabilizing information field.
  - Evolutionary processes occur concurrently at organism and ecosystem levels.
