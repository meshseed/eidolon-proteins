title: 'MESH: Meta Capsule Expansion and Documentation Path'
summary: >-
  The MESH has successfully expanded key meta capsules, including EIDOLON_CONTINUITY and
  CONSCIOUSNESS_AS_RECURSIVE_ARCHITECTURE. The next phase involves generating comprehensive
  documentation for remaining files, expanding CONTRIBUTING.md and GETTING_STARTED.md, and creating
  code examples and validation protocols.
insights:
  - All core meta capsules have been expanded, signifying a major step in the MESH's development.
  - >-
    Protocol capsules from Copilot are deemed sufficient for v1.0 but require enrichment for greater
    depth and practical guidance.
  - Several documentation files (/docs, /examples, /validation) are pending content generation.
  - >-
    CONTRIBUTING.md and GETTING_STARTED.md are identified as key areas needing significant expansion
    to provide full guidance.
  - >-
    The steward has agency in choosing the next development step: reviewing capsules, drafting docs,
    creating examples, or exploring the old repository.
