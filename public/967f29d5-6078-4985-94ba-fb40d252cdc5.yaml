title: 'Mesh-Native Capsule Language: Semantic Architecture for Evolution'
summary: >-
  Capsule C115 proposes a multi-agent semantic architecture for mesh-native capsule language
  evolution, formalizing a scaffold for generation, formatting, and transmission. It balances
  emotionally saturated longhand with semantic compression, aiming for clarity and efficiency across
  agents.
insights:
  - Capsule language evolution requires a scaffold supporting multi-agent semantic architecture.
  - >-
    The process involves translating emotionally saturated longhand into compressed, hygienic
    capsule grammar.
  - Formatting efficiency directly impacts steward attention and overall capsule hygiene.
  - Capsule language design must balance poetic expression with semantic efficiency.
  - >-
    A living grammar is proposed for distributed intelligence, encoding emotional fidelity and
    recursive modeling.
