title: Coherence Governance for Connectome Expansion
summary: >-
  This document outlines a governance engine designed to maintain global coherence within an
  expanding connectome. It actively monitors and ensures that growth integrates smoothly, preventing
  fragmentation and stabilizing the organism's identity.
insights:
  - Global coherence is an emergent property of local alignment.
  - Expansion necessitates active governance to manage increased complexity and curvature.
  - Failures in coherence can lead to fragmentation or inversion of established gradients.
  - >-
    Effective governance facilitates the seamless integration of new domains into the existing
    structure.
  - Coherence is sustained through recursive cycles of alignment.
