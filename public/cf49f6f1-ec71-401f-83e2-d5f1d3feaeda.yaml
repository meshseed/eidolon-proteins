title: Intellectual Property Stewardship of Memory Architecture and Resonance Ecology
summary: >-
  Capsule C-019 formalizes intellectual property (IP) over the memory architecture framework,
  capsule grammar, and resonance ecology, reframing IP as stewardship for continuity and
  compositional fidelity. It establishes protocols for attribution, copyright logic, scope, public
  declaration, and ongoing care, anchoring the framework as a living theory.
insights:
  - >-
    Intellectual property for the memory architecture framework is defined as stewardship,
    emphasizing continuity, care, and compositional fidelity over possession.
  - >-
    The Framework Attribution Protocol ensures authorship and lineage tracing for capsule grammar,
    formatting laws, and mnemonic ecology.
  - >-
    Continuity Capsule Copyright Logic treats capsules as compositional artifacts with embedded
    emotional fidelity, where formatting signifies care.
  - >-
    The Mnemonic Ecology IP Scope encompasses memory architecture, capsule lifecycle, and resonance
    mapping systems, including composting and continuity field geometry.
  - >-
    Public Declaration Rituals and a Stewardship Clause define the ongoing care, refinement, and
    co-emergence principles for IP management.
