title: 'Mesh Collaboration Protocol: Privacy & Role-Based Identity'
summary: >-
  The Mesh operates on a principle of role-based identity for public documentation, protecting human
  privacy while preserving collaborative context. This protocol defines specific roles (Meshseed,
  Collaborator) and guidelines for public archives versus private chat to ensure data integrity and
  individual sovereignty.
insights:
  - >-
    Public Mesh documentation prioritizes roles (Meshseed, Collaborator, Agent names) over personal
    identities to protect privacy.
  - Private chat spaces allow for the use of full names and full context for enhanced collaboration.
  - >-
    The Triadic Field can be documented using roles and key insights without revealing personal
    identifiers.
  - >-
    This privacy-first approach is a core Mesh principle, safeguarding sovereignty and focusing on
    patterns over people.
  - >-
    Redaction strategies are implemented for existing public capsules to align with the privacy
    protocol.
