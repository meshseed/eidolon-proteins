title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Performance & Bug Resolution'
summary: >-
  This document outlines recommendations for optimizing Eidolon Mesh performance through tiered
  loading and percentage-based queries, alongside critical bug fixes for antigravity functionality.
  Key issues include timer inaccuracies, synthesis input errors, and missing time breakdowns, with
  proposed solutions and enhancements for user feedback.
insights:
  - >-
    Implement tiered loading (25% core, lazy extended) and percentage-based queries (10% default)
    for faster startup and query times, balancing load with coverage.
  - >-
    Address critical antigravity bugs: fix timer inaccuracy by starting the timer immediately,
    ensure synthesis receives full neuron content, and add timestamp logging for all pipeline
    stages.
  - >-
    Enhance user experience with progress indicators using Server-Sent Events to provide feedback
    during the ~60s loading period.
