title: Query-Triggered Wave Propagation for Semantic Resonance Visualization
summary: >-
  The system now visualizes query results as a standing wave, where query-triggered wave propagation
  maps similarity scores to wave amplitude. This allows for a direct visualization of semantic
  interference patterns, revealing how activated nodes cluster at antinodes.
insights:
  - Query behavior understanding is foundational to emergent physics simulation.
  - Wave propagation, driven by BFS and oscillatory settling, naturally materializes answers.
  - >-
    Similarity scores directly translate to wave amplitude, enabling visualization of constructive
    interference at semantic antinodes.
  - >-
    The wave timing, performance constraints, and antinode clustering are learned through this
    recursive path.
  - >-
    Standing wave visualization provides an intuitive understanding of query resonance and activated
    subgraph dynamics.
