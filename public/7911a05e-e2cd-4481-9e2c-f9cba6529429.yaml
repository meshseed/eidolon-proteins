title: 'README as Entry Point: Mesh Structure, Mechanism, and Navigation'
summary: >-
  The README serves as a crucial entry point, designed to quickly reveal the mesh's structure,
  invite deeper exploration, and motivate viewing of its 'capsules'.  It should explain the
  underlying mechanism (resonance, compound perception) concisely using accessible metaphors,
  ensuring users understand it's not a traditional database and know how to navigate the 'organism'
  upon connection.
insights:
  - README must provide a quick structural overview.
  - README should invite deeper engagement with content ('capsules').
  - README needs to explain the mesh's mechanism (resonance, compound perception) concisely.
  - Accessible metaphors (like 'compound eye') are key for understanding.
  - Users should understand the mesh is not a traditional database.
  - The README should guide users on how to navigate the 'organism'.
