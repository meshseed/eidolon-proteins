title: 'Graph Breathing: Restoring Visual Aliveness with Physics Reheat'
summary: >-
  The 'cache clear' in older versions served to periodically reheat the graph's physics simulation,
  creating a visual sense of aliveness. The new implementation uses a periodic 'reheat' via
  `resetCountdown()` to achieve this, enhancing the user experience without impacting navigation or
  performance on large graphs.
insights:
  - >-
    Older versions used 'cache clear' to force graph physics re-simulation, creating a 'living'
    visual effect.
  - >-
    The 'breathing' effect is achieved by periodically reheating the physics simulation (e.g., every
    12s) using `resetCountdown()`.
  - >-
    This periodic reheat mimics the 're-unfold' behavior, providing visual dynamism without camera
    lock.
  - >-
    The breathing effect is automatically disabled for very large graphs (>1000 nodes) to maintain
    performance.
  - >-
    The underlying issue was a misunderstanding of the `3d-force-graph` API, specifically `d3Alpha`
    not being exposed directly, requiring the use of `resetCountdown()`.
