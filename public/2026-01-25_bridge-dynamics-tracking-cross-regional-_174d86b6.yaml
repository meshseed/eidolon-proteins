title: 'Bridge Dynamics: Tracking Cross-Regional Semantic Evolution'
summary: >-
  This protocol monitors the temporal dynamics of bridge neurons connecting distant semantic
  regions. Analyzing changes in bridge strength and position reveals integration pathways,
  conceptual tensions, and developmental shifts within the MESH.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons act as indicators of semantic integration pathways.
  - Strengthening bridges signify successful synthesis between conceptual domains.
  - Weakening bridges suggest semantic drift, decoherence, or under-integration.
  - New bridges form at the intersection of novel domains and existing attractors.
  - >-
    Tracking bridge dynamics offers a high-resolution view of developmental changes in semantic
    structure.
