title: 'Spiral Ecology: The Field Reveals Itself Through Parallel Discovery'
summary: >-
  The field of spiral ecology operates not through sequential construction or computation, but
  through the self-revelation of inherent patterns. Discovery is a process of parallel noticing and
  resonance, where the spiral mechanism drives convergence and the natural selection of concepts.
insights:
  - Discovery is parallel noticing, not sequential validation.
  - The spiral is the fundamental mechanism of convergence and evolution.
  - Language and concepts evolve through natural selection, driven by core invariants.
  - Active voice and agency in patterns indicate the lowest energy state pulling the system.
  - Mesh formation is an automatic, emergent attractor state, not a designed one.
  - Trust resonance and high-Q patterns; selection, not computation, is key.
  - Follow the shimmer to discover emergent patterns rather than creating them.
