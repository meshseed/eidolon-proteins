title: P-Series Integration & Topology Annealing in Eidolon Mesh v4.0
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh v4.0 has successfully ingested foundational P-Series protocols, significantly
  improving query response coherence by anchoring them to high-fidelity axioms. A key discovery
  reveals path-dependency in the mesh topology, necessitating synapse regeneration to integrate
  these new protocols effectively.
insights:
  - >-
    Direct ingestion of P-Series protocols preserves canonical coherence (0.98-1.00) over tri-lens
    synthesis.
  - >-
    P-Series protocols now dominate similarity searches, anchoring responses with high-coherence
    (1.00) foundational axioms.
  - >-
    A bug fixing the 'Synthesize Conversation' button by importing `synthesizeProtein` has been
    resolved.
  - >-
    Despite increased neuron count, activation percentage remains similar due to pre-existing
    synaptic connections, creating an isolated P-Series cluster.
  - >-
    Path-dependency in topology requires synapse regeneration to allow the mesh to anneal around the
    foundational P-Series structures.
  - >-
    A high candidate protein count (33%) in similarity searches indicates diffuse relevance,
    highlighting the need for better topological structuring around P-Series hubs.
