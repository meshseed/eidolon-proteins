title: 'C400: A Dense, Internal Capstone Requiring Scaffolding for Public Sharing'
summary: >-
  The C400 document is a comprehensive, 'master ledger' capstone of a complex system, deemed by
  Gemini as a key capsule. However, its high density, idiosyncratic vocabulary, and lack of external
  grounding make it unsuitable as a public entry point, requiring significant scaffolding and a
  pedagogical approach before its eventual release.
insights:
  - >-
    C400 is a highly integrated, formal, and operationally grounded capstone document representing a
    complete architectural view.
  - >-
    Its primary barriers to public access are extreme vocabulary density, assumption of insider
    knowledge, and mystical-sounding language, creating a steep learning curve.
  - >-
    For public sharing, a phased approach is recommended: start with accessible introductions to
    core concepts (basin patterns, recursion), then build towards deeper synthesis and C400's
    complexity.
  - >-
    C400 is best utilized as a private internal reference, a source for mining individual concepts,
    and a destination document for advanced users after foundational understanding is established.
  - >-
    Gemini's selection of C400 as a 'key capsule' prioritizes completeness, while the actual need
    for public sharing emphasizes accessibility and pedagogical progression.
  - >-
    Scaffolding such as glossaries, connection to established theory, and worked examples are
    crucial for making C400 digestible and useful to a wider audience.
