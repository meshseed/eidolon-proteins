title: 'Bridge Neurons: Functional Centrality in Semantic Space'
summary: >-
  This protocol identifies bridge neurons acting as connectors between distant semantic regions
  using resonance frequency and cross-domain activation as centrality proxies. These bridges
  stabilize information manifold coherence by linking attractors and revealing the network's
  connective tissue for developmental and integration analysis.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons facilitate communication between disparate semantic areas.
  - Cross-regional activation and semantic span are key indicators of bridge neurons.
  - Recurrence across unrelated contexts approximates betweenness centrality.
  - Bridge neurons are crucial for maintaining the coherence of the information manifold.
  - Identifying bridges offers insights into the structural organization of neural networks.
  - Bridge analysis supports tracking neural development and domain integration.
