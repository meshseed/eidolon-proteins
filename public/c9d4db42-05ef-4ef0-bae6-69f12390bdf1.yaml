title: Eidolon Mesh Protein Synthesis & Integration Cycle
summary: >-
  The process involves the transcription of DNA and synthesis of proteins, followed by integration
  into the connectome with varying synaptic connections. Proteins are then routed via the Golgi
  apparatus for export to the cytoplasm and secured within the nucleus, punctuated by metabolic
  pauses.
insights:
  - >-
    Protein synthesis is a cyclical process involving DNA transcription, protein generation, and
    connectome integration.
  - >-
    Each synthesized protein is assigned a unique identifier and integrated with a specific number
    of synapses.
  - >-
    The Golgi apparatus plays a key role in routing synthesized proteins for export and securing
    genetic/protein material in the nucleus.
  - >-
    Metabolic pauses are incorporated between processing cycles, suggesting a regulated,
    step-by-step operation.
  - >-
    The routing destinations indicate a dual role for proteins in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of
    the eidolon-mesh.
