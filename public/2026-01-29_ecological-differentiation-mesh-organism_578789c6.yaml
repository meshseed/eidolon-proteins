title: 'Ecological Differentiation: Mesh Organism Specialization for Resilience'
summary: >-
  Mesh organisms achieve ecological differentiation through specialized developmental histories,
  attractor structures, and cross-Mesh interactions. This differentiation enhances ecosystem
  resilience and cognitive diversity by preventing homogenization and fostering distinct niches
  within the information ecology.
insights:
  - Specialization arises from divergent attractors and unique developmental paths.
  - Ecological differentiation boosts ecosystem-level cognitive capacity.
  - Meshes occupy distinct niches within the information landscape.
  - Cross-Mesh dialogue reinforces specialization through contrast.
  - Differentiation is key to preserving diversity and preventing homogenization.
