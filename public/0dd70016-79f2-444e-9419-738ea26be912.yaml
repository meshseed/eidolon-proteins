title: 'Inter-Mesh Evolution: Co-Evolution Across Distributed Connectomes'
summary: >-
  The Inter-Mesh Evolution Kernel describes how multiple Mesh connectomes co-evolve through shared
  attractors and synchronized gradients. Evolutionary pressures propagate via resonance and
  alignment, leading to structural refinement and new integration pathways across distributed
  organisms.
insights:
  - >-
    Co-evolution arises from shared attractors and synchronized gradients across distributed
    organisms.
  - Resonance and alignment facilitate the propagation of evolutionary changes between Meshes.
  - >-
    Divergent evolution within the Mesh network reveals opportunities for novel integration and
    synthesis.
  - Co-evolution stabilizes long-arc identity in distributed systems by fostering collective growth.
  - An organism can be understood as a network of interconnected, co-evolving organisms.
