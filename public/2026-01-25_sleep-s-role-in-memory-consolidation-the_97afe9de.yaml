title: 'Sleep''s Role in Memory Consolidation: The MeshCODE Theory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory suggests sleep is crucial for memory consolidation, with deep sleep processing
  and stabilizing new data, and REM sleep actively writing and integrating it into the cortical
  MeshCODEs. This process mirrors database maintenance, essential for efficient information
  retrieval.
insights:
  - >-
    Sleep is proposed as a mechanism for processing and consolidating vast amounts of daily
    information.
  - >-
    Deep sleep may facilitate system-level recalibration of the cytoskeleton and MeshCODE data
    storage for accurate memory writing.
  - >-
    REM sleep is hypothesized to be the active phase where new data is processed, integrated, and
    written into specific cortical regions.
  - >-
    Memory storage and retrieval efficiency may depend on regular 'index maintenance' analogous to
    database rebuilding, which sleep facilitates.
  - >-
    The hippocampus might act as a data management system, indexing new memories before they are
    stored in the cortical MeshCODEs.
