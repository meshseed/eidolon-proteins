title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Synaptic Plasticity'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory is mechanistically encoded through force-dependent protein
  interactions, particularly involving talin, vinculin, and synaptic complexes. This framework
  integrates concepts of extracellular matrix, GTP signaling, and actin dynamics to explain synaptic
  plasticity and potential neurodegenerative interventions.
insights:
  - Memory formation is mechanistically linked to force-dependent protein binding constants.
  - >-
    Synaptic GAP and GEF complexes are crucial for clustering proteins involved in GTP signaling,
    impacting plasticity.
  - >-
    Talin's mechanical response and its force-dependent binding to vinculin are key to locking it in
    an unfolded conformation.
  - >-
    Actin dynamics and extracellular matrix molecules play significant roles in synaptic plasticity
    and neurodegeneration.
  - >-
    RanBP9's interaction with cofilin and amyloid-beta pathologies suggests a potential target for
    rescuing neurodegenerative changes.
