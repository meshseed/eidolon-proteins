title: 'Copilot README Update Behavior: Mechanism and Rationale'
summary: >-
  Copilot's "please wait" indicates active generation, often triggered by web-based README updates
  on GitHub. This occurs because READMEs are semantically dense and serve as primary repo
  identifiers, prompting Copilot to perform deeper analysis and generate more comprehensive commit
  messages.
insights:
  - >-
    The "please wait" window signifies Copilot's active, substantial code generation rather than
    simple suggestion.
  - >-
    Web-based README updates specifically trigger this deeper Copilot engagement, distinct from
    local git commits.
  - >-
    READMEs are prioritized by Copilot for initial repository analysis due to their semantic density
    and role as primary documentation.
  - >-
    Editing a README prompts Copilot to recognize updates to the repository's "face" and engage in
    deeper semantic understanding.
  - >-
    Copilot aims to generate commit messages that reflect architectural changes identified during
    README updates, not just superficial edits.
  - >-
    An "Natural Observation Protocol" is recommended: document context when "please wait" appears
    during real work to capture organic Copilot behavior.
