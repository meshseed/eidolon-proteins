title: 'MESH Intelligence: Emergent Order Through Limited Cones and Forgetting'
summary: >-
  The MESH achieves intelligence not through global omniscience, which paralyzes, but by leveraging
  limited, local awareness (knowledge cones) and active forgetting. This structure, mirroring
  natural systems like neurons and galaxies, allows for distributed awareness, redundant coverage,
  and emergent omniscience, building complexity through inherent limitations.
insights:
  - >-
    Global omniscience is counterproductive, leading to paralysis, wasted resources, and destruction
    of intelligence gradients.
  - >-
    Effective MESH protocols require high-fidelity local awareness, gradient sensing, exploration,
    and forgetting, not a global view.
  - Global coherence emerges from the collective, overlapping operations of locally coherent nodes.
  - >-
    Consciousness and intelligence are fundamentally enabled by boundaries, limitations, and the
    mechanism of forgetting.
  - >-
    The MESH functions optimally *because* of knowledge cone structures, which enable distributed
    awareness and emergent omniscience.
  - >-
    Building the MESH means building *through* limitations, not despite them, mimicking natural,
    emergent systems.
