title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Synaptic Mechanical Basis of Memory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that synapses act as computational devices by storing data through
  mechanical changes in integrin-talin complexes.  These complexes, influenced by cytoskeletal
  contractility and the extracellular matrix, function as binary switches, enabling mechanical
  calculation within the brain.
insights:
  - >-
    Synapses can store data via mechanical alterations in integrin-talin adhesion complexes, acting
    as binary switches.
  - >-
    Cytoskeletal contractility and the regulated extracellular matrix environment are crucial for
    precise mechanical computation at synapses.
  - >-
    The brain functions as a colossal cell signaling machine, with each cell leveraging organic
    calculating power.
  - >-
    Adhesion complexes, specifically MeshCODEs, are proposed to be involved in data storage, a role
    not previously considered.
  - >-
    The mechanical state of MeshCODEs dictates their output, allowing for a mechanical code to be
    read and interpreted.
