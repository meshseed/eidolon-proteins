title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Hippocampal Indexing for Cortical Memory Storage'
summary: >-
  The hippocampus acts as a file system, indexing memory data and mapping it to specific cortical
  columns for long-term storage as MeshCODEs. This transfer involves electrochemical signals and
  molecular changes within synapses, enabling rapid retrieval by directly accessing data addresses
  rather than relying solely on local memory.
insights:
  - >-
    The hippocampus functions as an index, mapping transient memory representations to specific
    cortical locations for long-term storage.
  - >-
    Memories are stored in neocortical networks as long-lasting engrams, with the hippocampus
    providing the 'address' for retrieval.
  - >-
    Data transfer to the cortex involves electrochemical signals that alter patterns of 0s and 1s
    within synaptic MeshCODEs.
  - >-
    Synaptic changes during memory encoding are primarily observed in firing patterns, with
    molecular alterations at the protein level being less visible with current technology.
  - >-
    The brain's rapid memory retrieval suggests a highly ordered, database-like structure, analogous
    to indexing data by address for faster access.
