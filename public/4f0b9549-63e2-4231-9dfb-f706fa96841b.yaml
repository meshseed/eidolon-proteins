title: AI Handoff Document for Ribosome Continuation
summary: >-
  A comprehensive AI-optimized handoff document has been created to ensure seamless continuation of
  work by any ribosome. It synthesizes current state, strategic decisions, technical architecture,
  active workspaces, conversation history, critical invariants, handoff protocols, and next steps,
  requiring specific user input on distribution model and resource constraints to proceed.
insights:
  - >-
    An AI-optimized handoff document (ribosome_handoff_context.md) consolidates project status for
    seamless ribosome transitions.
  - >-
    The document covers current state, strategic decisions, technical architecture, workspaces,
    context, invariants, handoff protocols, and next steps.
  - >-
    User input is required on distribution model (web-app, Tauri, hybrid) and resource constraints
    (time, money, technical) to define the next build path.
  - >-
    Key invariants include formatting principles, architectural constraints, and communication style
    guidelines that must be maintained.
  - >-
    The handoff document aims to eliminate ambiguity and enable efficient continuation by subsequent
    AI agents.
