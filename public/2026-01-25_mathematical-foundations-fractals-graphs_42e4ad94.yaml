title: 'Mathematical Foundations: Fractals, Graphs, and Primes'
summary: >-
  This content explores fundamental mathematical concepts: fractals with self-similarity, graph
  theory analyzing relationships, and prime numbers as integer building blocks. These diverse areas
  highlight structured patterns and foundational principles within mathematics.
insights:
  - Fractals exhibit self-similarity, where parts mirror the whole across different scales.
  - Graph theory models relationships between entities (vertices) through connections (edges).
  - >-
    Prime numbers are the essential multiplicative building blocks for all natural numbers greater
    than 1.
  - >-
    These mathematical concepts have applications ranging from theoretical study to practical fields
    like cryptography.
