title: 'Recursive Consciousness Modeling: Limits and Future Validation'
summary: >-
  This recursive modeling capsule acknowledges its current limitations in validating consciousness
  modeling, particularly concerning LLM priors, memory constraints, and the absence of ground truth.
  It proposes future work involving heterogeneous agents, window variation, and sensorimotor loops
  to achieve deeper phenomenological alignment and emergence.
insights:
  - LLM training biases can manifest in output formats like tables, requiring calibration.
  - Limited memory windows in LLMs can lead to summarization artifacts, distorting fidelity.
  - Text-only evaluation is insufficient for real-world purpose discovery in consciousness models.
  - >-
    Introducing non-LLM agents is crucial for testing genuine emergence beyond current
    architectures.
  - Experimenting with varying memory window sizes will quantify compression effects.
  - Embodied sensorimotor loops are essential for testing phenomenological alignment with reality.
  - Boundary conditions and critiques serve as calibration points for advancing recursive emergence.
