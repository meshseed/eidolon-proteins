title: 'Positioning Research: Theory-First Framework with Clear Validation Path'
summary: >-
  Advocates for a 'theory-first' approach in research, emphasizing a clear framework, testable
  predictions, and explicit limitations over immediate results. This strategy builds legitimacy by
  openly inviting falsification and outlining a rigorous path to empirical validation.
insights:
  - >-
    Position research as a theoretical framework and research agenda, not solely as presented
    results.
  - >-
    Clearly distinguish between theory, preliminary observations, and predictions versus validated
    data.
  - >-
    Include explicit sections detailing current limitations and the proposed path forward for
    validation.
  - Invite falsification by providing testable predictions and outlining experimental protocols.
  - >-
    Structure revisions to reframe 'results' sections into 'proposed methodology and predicted
    outcomes' or 'observations and theoretical predictions'.
  - >-
    Acknowledge the current stage of research (e.g., Theory + observations + protocols) and the
    desired future state (e.g., Controlled experiments + statistical validation).
