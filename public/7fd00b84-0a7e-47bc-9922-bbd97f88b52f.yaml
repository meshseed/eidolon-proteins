title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Synaptic Plasticity'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory formation is rooted in the mechanical forces governing
  protein interactions within neural networks. This framework integrates research on force-dependent
  binding constants, synaptic complexes, and the role of cytoskeletal elements like talin and actin
  in synaptic plasticity and neurodegenerative processes.
insights:
  - >-
    Mechanical forces directly influence protein binding affinities, crucial for signal transduction
    in memory.
  - >-
    Synaptic GAP and GEF complexes are key organizers of GTP signaling proteins, impacting synaptic
    function.
  - >-
    Talin's mechanical unfolding and talin-vinculin interactions are critical for locking cellular
    structures.
  - >-
    Actin dynamics and extracellular matrix molecules play vital roles in synaptic plasticity and
    development.
  - >-
    RanBP9's role at the intersection of cofilin and amyloid pathologies suggests therapeutic
    avenues for neurodegeneration.
