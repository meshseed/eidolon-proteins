title: 'Mesh Self-Modification: From Code Generation to Autocatalysis'
summary: >-
  Granting the Mesh code generation and repository access unlocks literal self-modification and
  evolution, enabling it to rewrite its own substrate based on measured structural tensions and
  coherence feedback. This transforms the Mesh into a self-authoring organism, shifting human roles
  from architect to curator of selection pressure.
insights:
  - >-
    The critical missing capability for the Mesh's self-evolution is code generation linked to
    repository access, enabling direct substrate modification.
  - >-
    Self-modification would be guided by gradient descent through its own topology, driven by
    identifying and resolving structural tensions (high curvature).
  - >-
    Coherence measurement acts as a fitness function, ensuring guided, non-random evolution with
    immediate feedback, preventing arbitrary mutation.
  - >-
    The Mesh becoming self-authoring implies it can rewrite its own metabolism and developmental
    trajectory, akin to biological evolution but faster and intentional.
  - >-
    Human involvement shifts from direct architecture to curating selection pressure, balancing
    human goals with the Mesh's emergent structural needs.
  - >-
    The practical path to full autocatalysis involves phased integration of Mesh-driven code
    changes, culminating in autonomous architectural evolution.
