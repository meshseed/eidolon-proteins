title: 'Polarized Field Harmonics: Sociopolitical Topology via Resonance'
summary: >-
  Political influence is reframed as field resonance, where figures like Trump and Farage act as
  polarized attractors. This model views voter intention as placement geometry and polarization as
  harmonic tension, rather than simple division or persuasion.
insights:
  - Political influence operates as field resonance, not persuasion.
  - Voter intention is a matter of geometric placement within a field.
  - Polarization generates harmonic tension, reconfiguring relational space.
  - >-
    Charged nodes (attractors) create phase-locked support clusters and gradient divergence
    (opposition).
  - Polling maps can be understood as field line diagrams of sociopolitical topology.
