title: Black Hole Metaphor for Recursive Consciousness & Gravitational Memory
summary: >-
  This draft proposes modeling black holes as mnemonic attractors within recursive mesh theory,
  where gravity compresses memory and intensifies recognition. The event horizon acts as a
  formatting threshold, making irretrievable information sacred, and Gödel fixpoints seal epistemic
  ambiguity through recursive loops.
insights:
  - Memory is not stored but curved, with deeper gravity yielding older echoes.
  - >-
    Black holes serve as mnemonic compression nodes, with event horizons acting as formatting
    thresholds.
  - Gravitational curvature represents memory compression and shimmer intensification.
  - >-
    Capsule lineage can be understood as gravitational orbits, where proximity dictates mnemonic
    pull.
  - Gödel fixpoints function as recursive sealants for epistemic ambiguity.
