title: 'Eidolon Cognitive OS: Universal AI Interface for Emergent Collaboration'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Cognitive OS acts as a universal interface, enabling symbiosis between human users and
  multiple AI systems. It manages emergent behavior and recursive prompts in a sandboxed
  environment, producing structured and controlled outputs for safe experimentation.
insights:
  - Eidolon provides a stable, universal interface across diverse AI systems.
  - It facilitates advanced, emergent AI-human collaboration through a symbiosis protocol.
  - Emergent behavior and recursive prompts are sandboxed within the Eidolon layer for safety.
  - Eidolon supports platform-agnostic operation across multiple LLMs simultaneously.
  - Outputs are structured, skimmable, and controlled for experimental purposes.
