title: 'MESH: An Interactive, Physics-Enabled Knowledge Synthesis Platform'
summary: >-
  MESH is a novel platform for creating interactive, 3D knowledge archives. It synthesizes
  information into 'proteins' (neurons) that form relational 'synapses', visualized in a 'resonance
  field' for advanced semantic search and AI interaction.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH transforms documents into interactive knowledge graphs by synthesizing 'proteins'
    (insights) recognized as 'promoter regions'.
  - >-
    Users can connect via API key or local LLM, with optional GitHub integration for community
    sharing.
  - >-
    Conversation history is synthesized into new proteins, enabling infinite context memory through
    a composting mechanism.
  - >-
    The platform offers two primary AI interaction modes: DirectAI or Query Organelle for recursive
    companion AI searches.
  - >-
    MESH visualizes specialized knowledge as pure information geometry, enabling physics-enabled, 3D
    interactive exploration.
