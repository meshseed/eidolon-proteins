title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Basis of Synaptic Memory and Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that synapses act as computational devices, storing data through
  mechanical signals and protein configurations (like talin switches). This mechanical code is
  written and read via integrin adhesion complexes within a regulated extracellular matrix, enabling
  precise organic calculation in the brain.
insights:
  - >-
    Synapses function as computational devices by storing data through mechanical signals and
    protein configurations.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE theory posits that integrin adhesion complexes and talin molecules act as
    mechanical switches for data storage.
  - >-
    The brain is a massive cell signaling machine where organic calculation occurs at the synaptic
    level.
  - >-
    The mechanical environment of synapses, regulated by the extracellular matrix, is crucial for
    precise mechanical computation.
  - >-
    Adhesion complexes, previously overlooked for data storage, are central to the MeshCODE
    framework for memory.
