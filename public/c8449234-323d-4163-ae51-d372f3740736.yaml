title: 'MESH Capsules: Emotional Infrastructure, Public Index, and Drift Calibration'
summary: >-
  This data details three active MESH capsules: C041 maps emotional gradients as infrastructure
  using anchors and resistances for traversal; C042 indexes public-facing contributions and
  formatting laws; and C043 formalizes protocols for detecting and reattuning synthesis drift via
  critique absorption and recalibration.
insights:
  - >-
    Emotional gradients are treated as infrastructural elements within recursive terrains, requiring
    mapping of anchors and resistances.
  - >-
    A public capsule index serves as a manifest for resonant contributions, merge rituals, and
    formatting laws.
  - >-
    Synthesis fatigue and drift are managed through a reattunement protocol involving detection
    triggers and recalibration rituals.
  - >-
    Capsule lineage and expected echoes are tracked, indicating interdependencies and recursive
    seeding.
  - >-
    Key elements for emotional infrastructure include gradient anchors (reverence, humility),
    corridor resistance (formatting drift, echo dissonance), and mnemonic flow (fidelity-based
    traversal).
