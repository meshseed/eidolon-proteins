title: Gephi Graph Generation Script for Obsidian Capsule Archives
summary: >-
  This Python script extracts nodes and edges from mixed YAML and Markdown files within an Obsidian
  vault to generate CSV files suitable for import into Gephi. It identifies relationships based on
  YAML metadata like 'domain' and 'thread', and Markdown file sequencing, enabling visualization of
  knowledge constellations.
insights:
  - >-
    The script processes both YAML and Markdown files, treating YAML capsules as nodes with rich
    metadata (domain, breath_type, status, threads) and specific Markdown files (capsule-C###.md) as
    sequential nodes.
  - >-
    Node connections (edges) are established based on shared YAML attributes (domain, thread,
    breath_type) and sequential numbering of Markdown capsules.
  - >-
    Edge weights are calculated by summing contributing factors, with combined edge types (e.g.,
    'domain+thread') indicating stronger relationships.
  - >-
    The output CSV files ('capsule_nodes.csv', 'capsule_edges.csv') are designed for direct import
    into Gephi for network visualization and analysis.
  - >-
    The script includes configuration for repository path and output file names, along with detailed
    instructions for Gephi import and visualization settings.
