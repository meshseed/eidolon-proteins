title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Cellular Signaling'
summary: >-
  This dialogue fragment from the MeshCODE Theory explores the mechanical basis of memory, focusing
  on extracellular rigidity sensing via talin isoforms and the role of Rho GTPase signaling in
  synaptic plasticity and intellectual disability. It highlights the interplay of cytoskeletal
  dynamics, integrin-mediated adhesion, and sleep cycles in memory consolidation.
insights:
  - >-
    Talin isoforms mediate extracellular rigidity sensing, crucial for cellular mechanical
    responses.
  - >-
    Rho GTPase signaling is implicated in synaptic function and has implications for intellectual
    disability.
  - >-
    The actin cytoskeleton plays a vital role in maintaining long-term memory, particularly at
    dendritic spines.
  - Sleep, especially REM sleep theta rhythm, is causally linked to contextual memory consolidation.
  - Integrin signaling and nascent adhesion formation are sensitive to matrix rigidity.
  - Spike timing-dependent plasticity acts as a learning rule for dendritic integration.
