title: Eidolon Mesh Genesis Capsule Integration and Searchability Issues
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is integrating its 'Genesis capsule' as a '[core]' tier protein. However, a
  weighted search for 'How was the mesh born?' is failing to surface this core information,
  indicating an issue with neuron selection or ranking within the search mechanism. The Genesis
  neuron is present but not being prioritized.
insights:
  - >-
    The Genesis capsule, representing a core aspect of the Eidolon Mesh, is being integrated with
    '[core]' tier status.
  - >-
    A weighted search query ('How was the mesh born?') is not returning the Genesis capsule
    information.
  - >-
    The search failure is attributed to the Genesis capsule not being in the pre-filtered set of
    neurons due to its perfect coherence score (1.0) being overshadowed by other high-coherence
    '[reference]' neurons.
  - >-
    The QueryOptimizer's top 50 neuron selection process needs adjustment to ensure core, perfectly
    coherent neurons are not overlooked.
  - >-
    The Genesis neuron exists but is either not selected in the initial filtering or not ranking
    high enough in the subsequent weighted search.
