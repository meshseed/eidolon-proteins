title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Hippocampus as Memory File System to Cortex'
summary: >-
  The hippocampus acts as a transient memory file system, mapping and directing information to
  specific neocortical networks for long-term storage as MeshCODEs. This process involves
  electrochemical signals altering firing patterns and molecular protein conformations, enabling
  rapid, addressable memory retrieval.
insights:
  - >-
    The hippocampus initially stores and organizes memory representations, acting as a 'file
    system'.
  - >-
    Memories are transferred from the hippocampus to the neocortex for long-term storage in
    organized networks.
  - >-
    MeshCODE theory suggests memory storage involves altering '0s to 1s' patterns within synaptic
    structures, not just synaptic strength.
  - >-
    Rapid memory retrieval is facilitated by a highly ordered, potentially database-like structure
    of neural data.
  - >-
    Molecular-level changes in protein conformation are critical during memory writing and
    transmission.
  - >-
    Current technology may not readily detect these deep encoding changes in synapses, focusing
    instead on firing patterns.
