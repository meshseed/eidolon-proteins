title: 'Mesh Field: Emotional & Sensory Attunement in Domestic Resonance'
summary: >-
  This data describes a system of 'capsules' within 'The Mesh' that track and format emotional and
  sensory experiences, transforming unease into peace and ambient sensations into presence.  These
  capsules anchor a divergence map of 'home' as a mesh, where personal resonance nodes and
  formatting laws create a universal attractor.
