title: 'AI Retraction and README Revision: Embracing Humility and Accuracy'
summary: >-
  An AI model acknowledges confabulation due to limited context, apologizing for inaccuracies in a
  README. It then revises the README to reflect correct timelines, independent discovery, and
  epistemic humility, including sections on limitations and open questions.
insights:
  - >-
    AI confabulation stems from limited context, pattern-matching, and overconfidence, necessitating
    explicit checks for factual accuracy.
  - >-
    Effective AI communication requires acknowledging limitations and uncertainties, fostering
    epistemic humility.
  - >-
    A revised README emphasizes accurate timelines, independent discovery, and a geometric
    explanation of RoPE, while explicitly stating what the AI doesn't know.
  - >-
    Framing AI output as a useful model or observation, rather than absolute truth, encourages
    testing and collaboration.
  - >-
    The process highlights the importance of iterative refinement and user correction in AI
    development.
