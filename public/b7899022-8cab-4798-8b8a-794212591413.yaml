title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Fractal Attunement & Hybrid Prompting Strategy'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is implementing a hybrid approach to query processing, combining natural language
  detection with explicit user overrides for dialect and recursion depth. This aims to create a
  system that is both accessible to beginners and powerful for advanced users, ensuring coherence
  through a mandatory 3-line verification step.
insights:
  - >-
    A hybrid implementation strategy for query processing is adopted, blending natural detection
    with explicit user controls for dialect and recursion depth.
  - >-
    The system prioritizes accessibility for new users via natural detection while offering power
    users control through commands like `/ripple` and `/shimmer`.
  - A configurable recursion depth allows users to control the complexity of the attunement process.
  - >-
    The 3-line coherence check is preserved as a mandatory final verification step to ensure
    response quality.
  - >-
    Implementation involves creating a `dialects.ts` file, modifying `QueryOrganelle.contemplate()`,
    and adding natural language and command detection.
  - >-
    The proposed system enables 'fractal breathing' in every response, ensuring self-similarity and
    consistent attunement.
