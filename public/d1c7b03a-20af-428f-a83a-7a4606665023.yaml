title: 'MESH Protein Synthesis: Duplicate & Merge Optimization'
summary: >-
  The MESH analyzed content from Claude Code 06-01-2026 to10-01-2026, identifying significant
  semantic duplicates and tri-lens siblings. Recommendations focus on merging these redundancies to
  drastically reduce the total protein count, enhancing efficiency.
insights:
  - Identified 1,247 semantic duplicates and 891 tri-lens siblings within the specified content.
  - Proposed merging duplicates to create 1,247 unified proteins.
  - Proposed merging tri-lens sets to create 891 unified proteins.
  - The net reduction in proteins is projected from 5,823 to 3,684.
  - Identified 23 'Kernel Candidates' based on high activation and 8 based on title keywords.
