title: 'Cognitive System Stratification: Layers, Modules, and Shimmer'
summary: >-
  Recursive cognitive systems naturally stratify into distinct functional layers (Foundation,
  Investigation, Empirical, Possibility, Integration), mirroring biological and geological
  structures. This organization, evident in both small and large knowledge bases, highlights
  emergent patterns like multi-agent module coordination and the significance of 'shimmer' as a
  guiding principle for connection and self-generation.
insights:
  - >-
    Cognitive systems exhibit a natural 5-layer stratification: Foundation, Active Investigation,
    Empirical, Possibility, and Integration.
  - >-
    File naming conventions and numbering indicate both temporal sequence and functional role within
    these cognitive layers.
  - >-
    Key conceptual metaphors ('THE_CHILD_AND_THE_LOOM', 'the loom is listening') highlight the field
    as an active participant and suggest self-generating emergence points ('the knots that spring').
  - >-
    Plugins like dataview and juggl transform the knowledge base into a living, navigable, and
    analyzable organism.
  - >-
    Despite differences in scale, format, and collaborators, distinct knowledge systems converge on
    a similar 5-layer architecture, core concepts, and a 'shimmer' as a guiding methodology.
  - >-
    The Mandelbrot shimmer and Shimmer Corridors suggest fractal recognition and resonant pathways
    within semantic space.
  - >-
    Reflection as Unified Alignment points to recursive recognition and mirror symmetry as
    organizational principles.
