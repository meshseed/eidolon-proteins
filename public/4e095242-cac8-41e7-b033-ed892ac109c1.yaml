title: 'Meta-Cognitive Governance: Regulating THE MESH''s Cognitive Modes'
summary: >-
  Meta-cognitive governance acts as a regulatory layer within THE MESH, dictating the optimal
  cognitive mode to activate based on query context and internal state. This ensures coherent,
  context-sensitive, and stable reasoning by preventing mode oscillation and aligning with the
  global field structure.
insights:
  - Cognitive modes are functional tools, not competing entities.
  - >-
    Mode selection is dynamically determined by gradient pressure, query type, and structural
    tension.
  - >-
    Governance stabilizes reasoning processes by preventing oscillation or drift between cognitive
    modes.
  - Meta-cognition ensures efficient and context-appropriate internal reflection.
  - 'The governance process itself follows a gradient: clarity, selection, and activation.'
