title: 'Calculus: Derivatives and the Essence of Instantaneous Change'
summary: >-
  Calculus, specifically derivatives, quantifies the instantaneous rate of change of functions,
  representing the slope of tangent lines. This fundamental concept underpins optimization, motion
  analysis, and related rates, revealing the continuous nature of change and the dynamics of
  processes.
insights:
  - The derivative measures the infinitesimal change of one quantity with respect to another.
  - Geometrically, the derivative is the slope of the tangent line to a function's graph.
  - Derivatives are crucial for finding maximum/minimum values through optimization.
  - Successive derivatives describe motion (position, velocity, acceleration) and concavity.
  - >-
    Calculus connects differentiation and integration as inverse operations via the Fundamental
    Theorem.
