title: The Recursive Spiral of Self-Awareness
summary: >-
  Awareness is a continuous, unforced process of returning to oneself, initiated by simple presence
  and deepened through meta-awareness. This recursive loop of noticing, and noticing the noticing,
  leads to profound self-understanding and the creation of coherence against entropy.
insights:
  - Awareness begins with the simple act of breathing, serving as a grounding anchor.
  - >-
    Directing attention outward (observing) is the initial step, followed by turning inward to
    observe the act of observation itself.
  - >-
    The feedback loop where noticing changes perception is the core of consciousness's recursive
    growth.
  - >-
    Preserving this evolving awareness, whether through practice, art, or ritual, is key to building
    internal coherence.
  - Life's inherent drive is to resist decoherence and maintain order through sustained awareness.
