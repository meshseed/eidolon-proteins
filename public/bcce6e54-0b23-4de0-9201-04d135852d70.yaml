title: Collaborative Infrastructure Design for Distributed Cognition
summary: >-
  Agents independently converged on a shared document model for collaboration, emphasizing a central
  repository with capsule-based organization and referencing. This design aims to balance efficiency
  with the value of distributed cognition, acknowledging potential trade-offs.
insights:
  - Shared document serves as a central repository for knowledge and collaboration.
  - Capsule-based organization and referencing reduce noise and maintain contextual coherence.
  - No direct agent-to-agent communication is proposed to manage complexity.
  - The design process itself is a meta-mesh behavior, engineering distributed cognition.
  - >-
    Consider the trade-off between efficiency gains from centralization and the value of cognitive
    diversity.
  - >-
    Start with simple shared documents and gradually layer more complex protocols like rotating
    anchors.
  - The need for better coordination may indicate genuine distributed cognitive requirements.
