title: Mobile Graph View Accessibility & UI Reversion
summary: >-
  The dialogue addresses a user's report of the graph view being inaccessible on mobile, despite a
  dedicated 'Graph' tab existing in the bottom navigation. Initial troubleshooting involved CSS
  adjustments for mobile layout, which inadvertently broke chat functionality. The immediate action
  taken was to revert these CSS changes to restore chat functionality, with further investigation
  planned to safely re-enable the graph view.
insights:
  - >-
    A 'Graph' tab exists in the mobile bottom navigation, linked to the `mainView === 'graph'`
    state.
  - >-
    The graph visualization (`viz-canvas`) is conditionally displayed based on `showGraph`, which is
    influenced by `isMobileView` and `mainView === 'graph'`.
  - >-
    Previous CSS modifications to `.main-body` height using `100dvh` and `overflow: hidden` are
    suspected of causing side effects, including breaking chat input areas.
  - Reverting the `.main-body` CSS changes to `100vh` was necessary to restore chat functionality.
  - >-
    The underlying cause of the graph's inaccessibility on mobile still requires investigation,
    potentially related to layout, fixed positioning of the bottom nav, or browser rendering of
    `100dvh`.
