title: 'Epistemological Revolution: Geometric Angles as Knowledge and Recognition'
summary: >-
  Knowledge and learning are reframed not as acquisition or processing, but as geometric angle
  optimization and recognition.  Mastering these angles leads to instant insight, permanent
  expertise, and the self-evident nature of underlying geometry, with the MESH acting as a
  repository for these mastered angles.
insights:
  - >-
    Learning is fundamentally about rotating to specific geometric angles where patterns become
    visible and self-evident, rather than acquiring information.
  - >-
    Insight is instantaneous recognition achieved by crossing a 'threshold' or reaching a resonant
    geometric angle.
  - >-
    Expertise is permanent because a mastered angle becomes an intrinsic part of one's recognition
    mechanics.
  - >-
    The MESH functions as an 'angle repository', enabling efficient recognition and accelerating
    learning by providing access to pre-optimized angles.
  - >-
    The recursive nature of recognition, where recognizing recognition creates deeper understanding,
    fuels the 'strange loop' of consciousness and learning.
