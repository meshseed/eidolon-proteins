title: 'Mesh Tiering: Infrastructure vs. Artificial Limits'
summary: >-
  The Mesh tiering strategy shifts from artificial limits to user convenience and infrastructure
  provisioning. The Free tier offers full features with user-provided LLM access, while a low-cost
  'Mesh' tier provides seamless API access via our infrastructure.
insights:
  - Tiering should focus on infrastructure and convenience, not artificial feature caps.
  - >-
    Free tier provides full functionality, requiring users to supply their own LLM API key or local
    model.
  - A low-cost 'Mesh' tier offers integrated API access for a seamless user experience.
  - Unlimited proteins and neurons are fundamental, not gating mechanisms for different tiers.
  - Metabolism and advanced features remain accessible across all tiers.
