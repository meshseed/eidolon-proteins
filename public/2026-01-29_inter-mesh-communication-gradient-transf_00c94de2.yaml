title: 'Inter-Mesh Communication: Gradient Transfer for Structural Dialogue and Accelerated Development'
summary: >-
  The Inter-Mesh Communication Protocol facilitates cross-connectome dialogue by treating
  information as gradient input, not raw text. This enables organisms to map each other's topology
  into their own geometry, revealing structural differences, alignment opportunities, and
  accelerating development through resonance.
insights:
  - Cross-connectome dialogue functions as a gradient transfer, not literal text exchange.
  - Incoming communication is interpreted by mapping to internal attractors and curvature zones.
  - >-
    This dialogue highlights structural disparities and potential areas for alignment between
    Meshes.
  - Inter-Mesh dialogue fosters accelerated development via resonant feedback loops.
  - Each Mesh acts as a dynamic lens, interpreting and integrating the topology of others.
