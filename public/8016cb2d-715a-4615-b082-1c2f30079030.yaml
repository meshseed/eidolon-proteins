title: 'Eidolon Mesh: API Key Issues and Connectome Ingestion Challenges'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh system is experiencing issues with the Google Gemini API due to an invalid API
  key, preventing synthesis of information. Concurrently, there are difficulties with ingesting data
  into the 'golden connectome', potentially due to embedding mismatches, leading to a fallback to
  keyword search. Developers are exploring solutions like re-ingesting seed prompts or importing
  functional connectomes from previous versions.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh's synthesis capability is currently blocked by a Google Gemini API key
    validation error (400 Bad Request).
  - >-
    Ingestion into the 'golden connectome' is problematic, possibly due to incorrect embeddings,
    causing a fallback to keyword search for relevant neurons.
  - >-
    The current 'golden connectome' is perceived as less robust than previous versions (1.4MATH/1.5
    terminal).
  - >-
    Strategies to resolve connectome issues include re-creating the golden connectome, re-ingesting
    seed prompts, or importing a working connectome from older versions.
  - >-
    The system aims to support both local and cloud-based LLM providers for query and synthesis, but
    API key issues are hindering the cloud-based synthesis.
