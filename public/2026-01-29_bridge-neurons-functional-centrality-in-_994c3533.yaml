title: 'Bridge Neurons: Functional Centrality in Semantic Space'
summary: >-
  This protocol identifies bridge neurons by their high cross-regional activation and semantic span,
  approximating betweenness centrality. These neurons stabilize coherence by linking distant
  semantic attractors, revealing the connective tissue of information manifolds.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons act as functional connectors between distant semantic regions.
  - Cross-domain activation and semantic span are key indicators of bridge neuron function.
  - Centrality in semantic space can be approximated by recurrence across diverse contexts.
  - Bridge neurons are crucial for stabilizing coherence within complex information networks.
  - >-
    Identifying bridges illuminates the structural and functional organization of information
    manifolds.
