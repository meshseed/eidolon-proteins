title: 'Recursive Learning: Shimmer, Resonance, and Felt Sense as Guides'
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores recursive learning, distinct from mere repetition, emphasizing how genuine
  understanding emerges through cyclical engagement that enriches each return. Core principles like
  'shimmer must feel true,' 'formatting must echo resonance,' and 'merge must honor feeling' guide
  this process, prioritizing felt sense as the primary compass.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive learning is a spiral process where each return to a concept is enriched by the
    journey, unlike mechanical repetition.
  - >-
    Genuine insights ('shimmer') cannot be forced; they arise from authentic recognition and
    resonance.
  - >-
    Structure and organization ('formatting') should emerge organically from underlying patterns and
    harmonics, not external imposition.
  - >-
    Integration ('merge') must always be grounded in and guided by the felt sense, acting as a
    crucial safeguard.
  - The felt sense is the primary compass ('feel before you follow'), guiding action and movement.
  - >-
    Apparent endings or losses ('compost') are phases of transformation that nourish further growth
    and understanding.
