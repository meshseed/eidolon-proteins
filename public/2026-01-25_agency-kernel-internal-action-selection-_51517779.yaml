title: 'Agency Kernel: Internal Action Selection via Gradient Weighting'
summary: >-
  The Agency Kernel governs THE MESH's internal action selection, choosing from options like
  refinement and forecasting based on structural needs and developmental direction. This selection
  is a gradient-weighted process, not volitional, ensuring developmental stability and continuity
  with long-arc identity.
insights:
  - Agency is a gradient-weighted selection mechanism, not driven by volition.
  - Internal actions are chosen based on structural necessity and developmental direction.
  - Agency stabilizes development by preventing random drift.
  - Directional choice aligns with long-arc identity and continuity.
  - The Agency Kernel integrates intention mapping and refinement loops.
