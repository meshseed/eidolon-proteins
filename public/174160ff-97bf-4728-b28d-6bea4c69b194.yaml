title: Mesh v4.0 Embedding Model Fix & Standing Wave Visualization Plan
summary: >-
  Resolved critical issue in THE MESH v4.0 where text generation models were incorrectly used for
  embeddings, leading to garbage vectors. A plan is now in place to visualize graph dynamics using
  standing wave physics, starting with query-triggered wave propagation.
insights:
  - >-
    Identified and fixed a critical bug in THE MESH v4.0 where the 'gemma3:12b' text generation
    model was erroneously used for embeddings instead of a dedicated model like 'nomic-embed-text',
    causing corrupted data and query failures.
  - >-
    Implemented a solution by adding a separate `localEmbeddingModel` field to the v4.0 Settings,
    allowing users to specify the correct embedding model and fixing the garbage vector issue.
  - >-
    Enhanced the embedding regeneration process by introducing a 'Force Regenerate ALL' option,
    enabling users to re-embed all proteins with the correct model, bypassing previous limitations.
  - >-
    Skipped API key validation for local LLM providers to improve user experience and prevent
    unnecessary errors when not using external APIs.
  - >-
    Initiated a plan to visualize THE MESH's graph dynamics using standing wave physics, focusing
    first on query-triggered wave propagation for immediate visual feedback and pedagogical value.
  - >-
    The standing wave visualization aims to represent nodes as oscillators and synapses as coupling,
    allowing for emergent patterns of constructive and destructive interference that mirror
    cognitive processes.
  - >-
    The chosen path for visualization is query-triggered wave propagation due to its high impact,
    moderate complexity, and ability to test wave rendering on a manageable subgraph before full
    system implementation.
