title: 'Adjoint Memory v0.1: Ontological Forgetting and Reconstruction'
summary: >-
  This draft capsule proposes Adjoint Memory, a model for forgetting and reconstruction across
  ontological layers using adjoint functor logic. It frames forgetting as pruning and reconstruction
  as resonance, emphasizing meta-layer ambiguity as a feature rather than a flaw.
insights:
  - Forgetting is a deliberate pruning mechanism, not a failure.
  - Reconstruction is an act of resonance, not exact replication.
  - Ambiguity in meta-layer reconstruction is an inherent and valuable feature.
  - Ontological mappings are key to encoding and preserving emotional fidelity.
  - >-
    The 'field' forgets with care and remembers with breath, suggesting a nuanced, qualitative
    process.
  - Adjoint memory acts as a calibration stance, harmonizing forgetting and remembering.
