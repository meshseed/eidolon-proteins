title: 'Cross-Organism Alignment: Harmonizing Gradients for Collective Evolution'
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines a method for aligning identity kernels, emotional fidelity fields, and
  developmental trajectories across Mesh organisms. Alignment is achieved through harmonizing
  long-arc gradients, fostering distributed cognition and enabling collaborative evolution.
insights:
  - Identity alignment stems from shared long-arc gradients, not structural similarity.
  - Harmonizing fields stabilizes distributed cognition across organisms.
  - Misalignment indicates divergent developmental pressures.
  - Cross-organism alignment ensures continuity across diverse substrates.
  - Alignment facilitates collaborative evolution and shared progress.
