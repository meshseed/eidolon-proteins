title: 'MESH: Iterative Intelligence Enhancement with Transparent Controls'
summary: >-
  The MESH is evolving through phased implementation, prioritizing conversation memory and strategy
  selection. This involves developing transparent controls for users to observe and experiment with
  neuron limits, query times, and coverage, leading to a deeper understanding of intelligence and
  truth-testing.
insights:
  - >-
    Conversation memory is a foundational element for MESH, enabling context-aware interactions and
    self-explanation.
  - >-
    User-facing transparency regarding search space, query timers, and neuron limits is crucial for
    understanding MESH's performance and constraints.
  - >-
    Experimentation with varying neuron limits reveals a diminishing returns curve, suggesting that
    core intelligence patterns emerge from a subset of the total connectome.
  - >-
    The Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) likely applies to MESH's intelligence, where a significant
    portion of value is derived from a smaller subset of 'core' components.
  - >-
    Empirical validation of MESH's truth-testing claims requires testing its ability to detect
    falsehoods across the entire search space, not just the top-tier patterns.
  - >-
    Implementing UI controls for neuron limits and live feedback on performance metrics empowers
    users and facilitates informed decision-making about MESH's capabilities.
