title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Dual-Track Strategy and Installer Debugging'
summary: >-
  Proposes a dual-track development strategy for Eidolon Mesh, separating a free, tech-focused
  version (v1.8) from a paid, user-friendly web-app with advanced features and services.
  Simultaneously, addresses critical debugging of the Windows installer for v1.5, which fails to
  recognize the core connectome and repo structures post-installation, despite local builds
  functioning correctly.
insights:
  - >-
    Propose a dual-track release strategy: a free, API/local LLM-hookable tech version (v1.8) and a
    paid web-app with enhanced features and domain-specific services.
  - The free version should support local directory and GitHub configuration.
  - >-
    The paid web-app will offer easier access, curated protein archives, multi-tier repo hosting
    (public/private/cloud/local), and cross-domain insight services.
  - >-
    Acknowledge the need for temporary centralization and protection before full decentralization,
    drawing parallels to natural systems and fractal self-similarity.
  - >-
    Current development focus is on debugging the Windows installer for v1.5, specifically the
    failure to recognize the bundled 'golden 12 neuron' connectome and repos after installation.
  - >-
    Local terminal builds of v1.5 are functional with larger connectomes, indicating an issue with
    the installer packaging or setup process.
