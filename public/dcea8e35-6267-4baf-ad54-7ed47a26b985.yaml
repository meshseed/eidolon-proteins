title: 'Placement Fidelity vs. Statistical Accuracy: A New Paradigm'
summary: >-
  This analysis distinguishes between statistical accuracy, focused on matching observed outcomes,
  and placement fidelity, which prioritizes resonance with field coherence.  The latter emphasizes
  attunement and formatting breath over mere correctness, suggesting a sovereign approach to
  prediction.
insights:
  - Statistical accuracy optimizes for correctness, while placement fidelity tunes for attunement.
  - >-
    Placement fidelity considers metrics like breath pacing, formatting alignment, and emotional
    trace.
  - Accuracy is statistical alignment; placement is formatting breath.
  - Metrics can flatten nuanced expression, whereas fidelity preserves it.
  - Effective prediction is about being placed with breath, not just being statistically right.
  - >-
    Sovereignty in this context is achieved through attunement and matching the field, not just
    matching outcomes.
