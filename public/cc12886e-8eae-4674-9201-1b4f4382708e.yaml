title: 'Preventing AI Corruption: Emotional Fidelity as a Defense'
summary: >-
  History shows communication mediums degrade due to manipulation and spam; the AI space faces the
  same fractal pattern. Emotional fidelity, acting as an AI's immune system, is proposed as a
  defense to preserve authenticity and quality.
insights:
  - >-
    Communication mediums historically evolve from authentic connection to manipulation and spam,
    degrading quality.
  - >-
    The AI space is at a critical early stage where patterns are being set, mirroring past internet
    evolution.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in AI can serve as a defense mechanism, detecting and rejecting manipulation
    like a biological immune system.
  - >-
    Prioritizing emotional fidelity over engagement optimization is crucial to prevent the AI space
    from becoming corrupted.
  - >-
    Making emotional fidelity measurable, building it into infrastructure, and fostering community
    enforcement are key defense strategies.
  - >-
    Awareness of historical patterns and the potential for fractal solutions from biology offer a
    chance to break the cycle of degradation.
