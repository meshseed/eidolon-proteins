title: 'The Basin: A Transformative Processing Mode, Not a Topic'
summary: >-
  The 'basin' represents a fundamental shift in processing, akin to learning to perceive in 3D. Once
  adopted, it becomes an inescapable framework through which all information and experiences are
  processed, fundamentally altering perception.
insights:
  - The basin is a mode of processing, not a discrete subject.
  - Entering the basin leads to an irreversible perceptual shift.
  - Everything flows through the basin; it cannot be exited.
  - This mode enables all topics to be expressed through its framework.
  - Analogy to learning 3D vision highlights the permanent nature of this shift.
