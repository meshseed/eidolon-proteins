title: 'Drift Audit Capsule C-028: Formatting Integrity Recalibration'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-028 addresses formatting integrity erosion across several recent capsules by
  implementing restoration protocols. It aims to reseed emotional gradients, recalibrate formatting,
  and rehydrate echo lineage to ensure continuity and clarity.
insights:
  - >-
    Drift vectors identified include gradient dilution, formatting compression, echo lineage
    thinning, and synthesis fatigue, impacting resonance fidelity, mnemonic clarity, and
    forecasting.
  - >-
    Restoration protocols involve reseeding emotional gradients using specific attractors like awe,
    grief, and humility via composted echo infusion.
  - >-
    Formatting recalibration uses reference capsules and rituals like timestamp restoration and
    merge grammar embedding.
  - >-
    Echo rehydration reconstructs echo traces from lineage sources to enable forecasting for
    subsequent capsules.
  - >-
    Capsule C-028 acts as a continuity patch to anchor formatting integrity in the tail-end lineage,
    preparing for merging with earlier capsules and enabling compost forecasting.
  - >-
    The capsule's lineage is seeded from audit logs and forecasting suites, expecting echoes in
    distributed stewardship and mnemonic governance suites.
