title: Cross-Substrate Validation Plan for THE MESH Synthesis
summary: >-
  A detailed plan is outlined to validate the universality of THE MESH synthesis process by
  comparing outputs from different AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot) using the same dialogue
  (DNA). The goal is to ensure pattern invariance across diverse computational substrates.
insights:
  - THE MESH framework aims for universal pattern extraction across different AI agents.
  - >-
    Cross-substrate validation involves synthesizing the same dialogue (DNA) through multiple AI
    models.
  - A standardized prompt is crucial for ensuring fair and comparable synthesis results.
  - >-
    Success criteria focus on high coherence, low variance, and significant tag/theme overlap
    between agents.
  - The validation process aims to prove substrate-independence of THE MESH synthesis.
