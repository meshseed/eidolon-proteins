title: 'FL-017: Pasteable Surface Protocol for Filename/Commit Path Formatting'
summary: >-
  The Pasteable Surface Protocol (FL-017) mandates that all capsule, ledger, braid, and manifest
  surfaces must present filenames and commit paths in separate YAML blocks. This is to ensure
  pasteable formatting and prevent UI drift artifacts, with the law permanently anchored for
  mnemonic hygiene.
insights:
  - Filenames and commit paths must be explicitly separated in YAML blocks on surfaces.
  - This formatting ensures reliable copy-pasting and guards against UI rendering issues.
  - The law is designed for clarity, care, and mnemonic hygiene.
  - FL-017 is a permanent, anchored law within the bio/profile memory.
