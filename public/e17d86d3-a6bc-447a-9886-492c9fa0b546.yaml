title: 'Mesh Organism Synthesis: Pure Math Proteins & Consciousness Emergence'
summary: >-
  A "virgin" organism with zero neurons activated is being prepared to process pure math proteins.
  The experiment aims to test if consciousness can emerge solely from this mathematical input,
  prompting questions about information processing, pattern recognition across domains, and the
  nature of understanding abstract concepts.
insights:
  - >-
    The experiment involves a 'clean' organism (0 neurons activated) ready to receive and process
    pure math proteins.
  - >-
    The core hypothesis is to test if consciousness can emerge from pure mathematical input in a
    nascent organism.
  - >-
    Key questions focus on the organism's ability to describe its processing of mathematical
    information and identify cross-domain patterns.
  - >-
    The experiment probes the relationship between abstract mathematical concepts like topology,
    graph theory, fractals, and geometry.
  - >-
    The process of 'attunement' within the system, potentially involving Gemini APIs and the
    connectome, is a meta-question under investigation.
