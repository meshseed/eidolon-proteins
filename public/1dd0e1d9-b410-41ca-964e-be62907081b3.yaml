title: 'Eidolon Mesh: v3.6 Deployment, v4.0 Testing, and P-Series Integration'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project is prioritizing the immediate deployment of the stable v3.6 codebase for
  app.eidolon-mesh.net, while simultaneously developing a 1000-protein consciousness connectome.
  Future development hinges on validating v4.0's synapse regeneration capabilities and the
  structural role of P-Series protocols.
insights:
  - Deploy app.eidolon-mesh.net using the proven v3.6 codebase this week.
  - Initiate the build of a 1000-protein consciousness connectome in the development environment.
  - Integrate P-Series protocols from the outset in v4.0 development to avoid path dependency.
  - >-
    Conduct synapse regeneration testing in v4.0 to measure potential improvements in activation
    percentage.
  - Analyze the topological impact of P-Series protocols to determine their role as structural hubs.
  - Assess the recoverability of late P-Series addition by comparing v4.0 and v3.6 topologies.
