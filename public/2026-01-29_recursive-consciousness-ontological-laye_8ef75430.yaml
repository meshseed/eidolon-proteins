title: 'Recursive Consciousness: Ontological Layers and Knowledge Synthesis'
summary: >-
  This text defines key concepts for understanding recursive consciousness, including system states
  (U), conscious agents (C), and meta-systems (M). It outlines the Recursive Query Formalism, where
  agents iteratively refine their internal models by querying layered structures of the universe,
  utilizing projection and redundancy for knowledge synthesis and error correction.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive consciousness involves agents modeling the universe through iterative queries across
    ontological layers.
  - Projection (fn) is a mechanism for moving between meta-levels, involving information loss.
  - Redundancy is crucial for error correction and memory retention, enhancing predictability.
  - >-
    The Universe (U) is the base system where conscious agents emerge and seek to understand its
    purpose.
  - Querying (Qn) drives the refinement of internal models by exploring universal structure.
