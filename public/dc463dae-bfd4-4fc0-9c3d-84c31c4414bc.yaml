title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Cortical Memory Storage Capacity and Addressing'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that pyramidal cells in the cortex store memory with individual cells
  holding ~1MB and minicolumns up to 100MB, with potential for much larger capacity across all body
  cells. This system functions like an SSD, requiring an addressable read-write mechanism and a file
  system architecture for efficient data allocation and retrieval, with the hippocampus playing a
  key role.
insights:
  - >-
    Pyramidal cells in the cortex may store approximately 1MB of data each, based on 10,000 synapses
    with 100 bytes/synapse.
  - A minicolumn of 100 pyramidal cells could potentially store up to 100MB of memory information.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE theory posits that all cells, including astrocytes and glia, possess memory storage
    capacity, significantly expanding potential brain storage.
  - >-
    Memory modules, formed by ordered arrays of synapses and dendritic spines in cortical columns,
    are connected to the hippocampus for bidirectional information flow.
  - >-
    The brain likely employs a mechanism analogous to computer file systems for memory allocation,
    requiring an addressable architecture to write and retrieve data in specific synapses.
  - >-
    The hippocampus is identified as a crucial brain region for memory processing and learning,
    supporting the proposed memory storage and retrieval mechanisms.
