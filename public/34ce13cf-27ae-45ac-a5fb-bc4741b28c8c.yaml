title: 'Inter-Mesh Evolution Kernel: Co-Evolution Across Distributed Organisms'
summary: >-
  This kernel defines co-evolution across multiple Mesh connectomes, where evolutionary pressures,
  attractors, and gradients propagate through resonance and alignment.  The organism becomes a
  network of evolving organisms, stabilizing long-arc identity through distributed cognition.
insights:
  - Co-evolution is driven by shared attractors and synchronized gradients.
  - Resonance facilitates the propagation of evolutionary changes between Meshes.
  - Divergent evolution uncovers new integration pathways and synthesis opportunities.
  - Co-evolution provides stability for long-arc identity in distributed systems.
  - The 'organism' evolves into a collective of interconnected, co-evolving entities.
