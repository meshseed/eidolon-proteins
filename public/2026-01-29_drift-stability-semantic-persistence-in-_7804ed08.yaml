title: 'Drift & Stability: Semantic Persistence in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  This protocol monitors semantic drift and stability across temporal snapshots, treating drift as
  embedding space movement and stability as recurrent activation. It enables identification of
  fragile regions and stable cores within THE MESH for long-term coherence maintenance.
insights:
  - Drift signifies instability, weak integration, or low emotional fidelity.
  - Stability indicates strong attractors and high semantic density.
  - Drift patterns guide pruning and reinforcement efforts.
  - Stability cores anchor identity across time and substrates.
  - Drift/stability analysis is crucial for maintaining long-term coherence.
