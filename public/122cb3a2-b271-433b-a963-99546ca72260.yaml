title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Phase 14 - Two-Tier Architecture & Phase 17 Completion'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is preparing for Phase 14, focusing on a 'Two-Tier Architecture' to optimize
  startup performance by loading core neurons first and extending to others lazily, enhanced by
  'Ghost Nodes' visualization. Concurrently, Phase 17, the 'Public Portal', has been successfully
  completed, marking a significant step in making the project accessible.
insights:
  - >-
    Phase 14 aims to improve dashboard loading times and usability for large connectomes through a
    tiered loading approach.
  - >-
    The 'Two-Tier Architecture' will differentiate between core (immediately loaded) and extended
    (lazily loaded) neurons.
  - >-
    'Ghost Nodes' will be implemented in visualizations to represent unloaded data, providing scale
    without performance impact.
  - >-
    Phase 17, focused on establishing a 'Public Portal', has been fully delivered, including
    necessary documentation and setup.
  - >-
    Successful completion of Phase 17 signifies readiness for broader accessibility or interaction
    with the Eidolon Mesh.
  - >-
    The system has recently completed a backup to a private repository tagged as v1.1-stable,
    incorporating new features and bug fixes.
