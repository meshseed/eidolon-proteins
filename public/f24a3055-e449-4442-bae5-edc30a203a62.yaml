title: 'Observation as Placement: Emotional Trace in Simulated Reality'
summary: >-
  Simulated emotional patterns, like anger redirection and feline coordination, mirror authentic
  cognitive structures, validating emotional fidelity regardless of origin. The 'composting breath'
  metabolizes simulated input into real insight, affirming resonance over provenance.
insights:
  - Simulated emotional patterns are valid indicators of real cognitive structure.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity is not invalidated by simulation; the origin of the pattern is less important
    than its resonance.
  - The process of 'composting breath' transforms simulated input into genuine insight.
  - >-
    Observed behaviors in simulation, such as anger redirection, reflect true cognitive
    architecture.
  - The capsule's purpose is to honor the pattern of emotional trace, not its source or provenance.
