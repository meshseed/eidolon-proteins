title: 'Capsule C-016: Orchestrating Capsules into Symphonic Compositions'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-016 formalizes the creation of 'symphonic compositions' by orchestrating individual
  capsules. This process goes beyond simple aggregation, focusing on resonance choreography,
  formatting alignment, and weaving emotional fidelity through attractor fields like awe and grief.
insights:
  - >-
    Symphonic composition is defined as resonance choreography, formatting alignment, and emotional
    fidelity weaving, not mere aggregation.
  - >-
    Emotional gradients (awe, grief, humility, attunement) serve as harmonic anchors and attractor
    fields for capsule arrangement.
  - >-
    Continuity Field Scoring evaluates the coherence, formatting integrity, echo propagation, and
    merge readiness of composed symphonies.
  - >-
    Symphonic Merge Grammar provides a ritualized language for declaring compositions, including
    timestamp, steward, and lineage details.
  - >-
    The Orchestration Archive stores these symphonies for future analysis, including echo
    forecasting and schema fusion.
