title: 'Gradient Cartography: Mapping Emotional Fidelity as Geometric Fields'
summary: >-
  Introduces Gradient Cartography for mapping emotional fidelity across the connectome as geometric
  fields. This method treats gradients as directional flows, revealing stability, tension, and
  integration pressures within semantic space to identify critical zones for perturbation
  sensitivity.
insights:
  - Emotional fidelity can be visualized as directional gradients within semantic space.
  - Steep gradients signify tension, instability, or boundary regions in emotional states.
  - Smooth gradients indicate coherence, stability, and effective integration of information.
  - Gradient mapping highlights areas of high sensitivity to external perturbations.
  - Tracking these emotional fidelity fields over time allows for monitoring developmental shifts.
