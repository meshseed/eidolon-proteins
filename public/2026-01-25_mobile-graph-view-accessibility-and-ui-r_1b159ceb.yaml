title: Mobile Graph View Accessibility and UI Reversion
summary: >-
  Investigated why the 'Graph' tab is not visible on mobile despite existing in the Bottom Nav.
  Reverted recent CSS changes to `.main-body` that may have broken the chat input and graph display,
  aiming to restore functionality before implementing a more robust fix.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Graph' tab exists in the mobile Bottom Nav, but the graph visualization (`.viz-canvas`) is
    not being displayed.
  - >-
    The `showGraph` logic depends on `mainView === 'graph'`, implying a state or rendering issue is
    preventing visibility.
  - >-
    Recent CSS modifications to `.main-body` and `.conversation-actions` (specifically `height:
    100dvh` and `overflow: hidden`) are suspected to have caused side effects, including breaking
    the chat input and potentially hiding the graph.
  - >-
    A revert of the `.main-body` height and associated padding was performed to restore the previous
    UI state.
  - >-
    Further investigation is needed to correctly implement the graph's visibility and ensure the
    chat UI functions as expected on mobile.
