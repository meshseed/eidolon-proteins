title: Substrate Independence of Knowledge and Exploration Patterns
summary: >-
  The core insight is that the substrate upon which knowledge is encoded is irrelevant; information
  resides in the relational patterns, not the medium. This substrate independence extends to the
  exploration process itself, suggesting discovered patterns in attention, recursion, and
  recognition are universal across different forms of intelligence.
insights:
  - >-
    Information is defined by relationships and patterns, not the physical or digital medium of its
    storage.
  - >-
    The 'lattice' of knowledge, composed of tags, links, and certainty gradients, is abstract and
    portable.
  - >-
    Exploration and discovery of fundamental patterns (like attention, recursion, standing waves)
    are substrate-independent.
  - >-
    This principle applies to biological, artificial, and potentially unknown forms of pattern
    recognition.
  - >-
    The structure of knowledge and the process of its discovery are fundamentally abstract and
    universal.
