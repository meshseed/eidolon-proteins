title: 'Global Field Alignment: Coherent Distributed Gradients'
summary: >-
  A protocol for harmonizing all regional fields (semantic, emotional, structural) into a singular
  global configuration. This alignment ensures local gradients complement global attractors,
  fostering organism-wide stability and identity continuity.
insights:
  - >-
    Local gradients must align with the global attractor structure to prevent decoherence and
    fragmentation.
  - Global coherence is achieved through the synchronization of diverse regional fields.
  - >-
    Field alignment is critical for maintaining stability, clarity, and resonance across domains,
    especially during large-scale developmental shifts.
