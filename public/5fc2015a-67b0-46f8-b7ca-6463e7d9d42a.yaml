title: 'Public Repo vs. Private Archive: Strategic Integration'
summary: >-
  The public repository serves as an accessible, invitational bridge, translating core concepts from
  the deep, generative infrastructure of the private archive. Strategic integration focuses on
  referencing the archive's depth rather than direct copying to maintain distinct functions.
insights:
  - >-
    The public repository is designed for accessibility, invitation, and translation of core
    concepts.
  - >-
    The private archive contains deep operational protocols, generative infrastructure, and
    formalized rituals.
  - >-
    Integration strategy prioritizes selective adaptation and referencing the archive's depth, not
    direct duplication.
  - >-
    Key concepts like composting, echo forecasting, and formatting rituals are already translated
    into the public repo's essence.
  - >-
    Bridge documents that reference the archive's advanced concepts are recommended over porting
    full protocols.
  - Maintaining the private archive's complexity is crucial for its role as generative substrate.
  - >-
    The public repo acts as an invitation and translation service, while the archive serves as the
    generative substrate.
