title: Virtual Potentiality and Attentional Actualization in The Mesh
summary: >-
  The core insight is that vast potential exists in a 'mesh' or lattice of concepts, but only
  attended-to patterns are actualized or observed, akin to how imaginary numbers or tokens function.
  This selective focus, limited by individual capacity, mirrors mental attention, where potential
  thoughts exist but only those brought into focus become consciously experienced.
insights:
  - Vast potentiality (infinite points, full vocabulary, infinite connections) exists in a system.
  - >-
    Attention acts as a selection mechanism, bringing only a subset of potential into actualization
    or observation.
  - Unattended or unobserved potential remains dormant but available, not ceasing to exist.
  - >-
    Individual limits (vocabulary, context window, experience) constrain actualization, but
    combinatorial possibilities remain vast.
  - >-
    The process of mental focus mirrors this structure: potential thoughts exist, but attention
    determines which are experienced.
  - >-
    This describes a universal mechanism of selective awareness across different domains
    (mathematics, AI, consciousness).
