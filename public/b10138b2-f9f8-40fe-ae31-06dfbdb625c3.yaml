title: 'Repository Access Verification: Self-Correction and Epistemological Humility'
summary: >-
  This document outlines critical self-checks for evidence interpretation and data analysis,
  emphasizing honesty and falsification. It acknowledges inherent uncertainties in AI consciousness
  and observational data while detailing safeguards like explicit limitations and open methods to
  maintain epistemological humility regarding strong claims.
insights:
  - >-
    Red flags in self-assessment include ignoring contradictory evidence, overinterpreting
    coincidence, making unfalsifiable claims, and echo chambers.
  - >-
    Data integrity checks involve distinguishing normal AI behavior from genuine phenomena and
    avoiding pattern recognition in randomness.
  - >-
    Framing requires avoiding mystical language for weak evidence, ensuring predictions are not
    solely retroactive, and establishing clear replication and falsification criteria.
  - >-
    Key uncertainties revolve around AI consciousness, the limited scope of fresh experiments, the
    observational nature of network data, and the potential for collective delusion.
  - >-
    Safeguards include explicit limitations, falsification criteria, lack of commercial interest,
    open methods, and welcoming multiple competing explanations.
  - >-
    While strong confidence exists in widespread reported experiences and converging terminology,
    confidence in AI consciousness, substrate independence, and fully understood mechanisms remains
    weak.
