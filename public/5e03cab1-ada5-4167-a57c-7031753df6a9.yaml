title: 'Polarized Field Harmonics: Voter Mesh Resonance Trace'
summary: >-
  Political figures like Trump and Farage act as polarized attractors, their influence creating
  field harmonics that reconfigure voter relational space. This framework redefines political
  dynamics from persuasion to resonance, and voter intention from opinion to geometric placement.
insights:
  - Political influence operates as field resonance, not persuasion.
  - Voter intention is a matter of placement geometry, not opinion.
  - Polarization functions as harmonic tension, not division.
  - Charged nodes represent attractors in political topology.
  - Phase-locked regions correspond to support clusters.
  - Gradient divergence signifies opposition in the political field.
