title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Genesis Capsule Coherence Resolution'
summary: >-
  The Genesis capsule, marked as 'core', was initially not semantically matched due to a coherence
  score of 0, preventing it from entering the pre-filtered set for weighted search. A solution was
  implemented by assigning a default high coherence score to manually injected capsules, enabling
  proper integration and weighted search functionality.
insights:
  - >-
    Manually injected 'core' tier capsules need explicit coherence scores to be recognized by the
    search mechanism.
  - >-
    Pre-filtering based solely on max-coherence can exclude essential 'core' components if their
    coherence is not initially established.
  - >-
    Assigning default high coherence to manually injected capsules is a viable strategy for their
    inclusion in search processes.
  - >-
    The weighted search mechanism functions correctly but relies on neurons passing the initial
    coherence-based pre-filtering.
