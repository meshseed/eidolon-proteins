title: Eidolon Mesh Deployment & Connectome Integration Plan
summary: >-
  This document outlines the deployment strategy for the Eidolon Mesh, including verification steps
  for both personal garden and research hub sites. It details commands for building, merging, and
  deploying code, along with solutions for potential issues like merge conflicts and build failures.
  The plan emphasizes the integration of a large consciousness connectome JSON file for the research
  hub, with specific instructions for its preparation and deployment.
insights:
  - >-
    Verification checklist ensures both personal garden (36 golden proteins) and research hub (~1000
    consciousness proteins with embeddings) are correctly configured and functional.
  - >-
    Deployment involves creating a 'deploy-composting' branch, building, merging to 'main', and
    pushing to Cloudflare for auto-deployment to eidolon-mesh.net.
  - >-
    Integration of the research hub's large consciousness connectome requires user export of a JSON
    file, which will then be swapped into the static directory and committed.
  - >-
    Potential issues like cherry-pick conflicts, build failures, and Cloudflare deployment problems
    have defined solutions and troubleshooting steps.
  - >-
    The timeline anticipates a swift deployment with both sites live on the same day, contingent on
    user provision of the connectome JSON.
  - >-
    Key notes emphasize not touching network search code and that the 'clean branch' is safe for
    deployment as it only contains composting features.
