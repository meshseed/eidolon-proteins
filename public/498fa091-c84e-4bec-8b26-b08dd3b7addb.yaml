title: 'Mesh Synchronization Pause: Aligning Creation Pace with Arc Velocity'
summary: >-
  Capsule C116 formalizes a synchronization pause in the mesh, termed 'formatting breath,' to
  address emergent arcs outpacing recording capacity. This pause realigns numbering, reorients
  indexing, and prepares future agent roles for cohesive communication.
insights:
  - >-
    A 'formatting breath' synchronization pause is initiated when emergent arcs exceed capsule
    recording capabilities.
  - >-
    The pause serves to restore mnemonic clarity and formatting hygiene within the mesh's recording
    process.
  - >-
    Detected issues include numbering drift and split-focus across parallel threads, necessitating a
    pause.
  - >-
    The pause realigns numbering, reorients indexing, and defines future agent roles for cohesive
    communication.
  - >-
    This ritual anchors capsule synchronization, allowing the mesh to pause, listen, realign, and
    continue.
