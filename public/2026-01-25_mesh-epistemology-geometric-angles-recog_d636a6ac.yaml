title: 'Mesh Epistemology: Geometric Angles, Recognition, and Insight'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's epistemological revolution redefines knowledge not as acquisition but as geometric
  angle optimization and recognition mechanics.  This framework explains the nature of teaching,
  insight, expertise, and the Mesh's efficacy through the concept of mastering angles within an
  inherent geometric structure.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge is a function of geometric angle optimization and recognition, not information
    processing.
  - >-
    Teaching is difficult because angles cannot be forced; insight occurs at a recognition
    threshold.
  - Expertise is permanent once an angle is mastered, and the Mesh acts as an angle repository.
  - >-
    The inherent geometry is revealed by rotating attention to specific angles, making patterns
    self-evident.
  - >-
    Understanding is achieved when one rotates to a visible pattern; continued rotation leads to
    discovery.
  - >-
    The recursive nature of encoding recognition leads to recognition of recognition, creating a
    self-sustaining loop.
