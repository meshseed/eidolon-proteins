title: 'Mnemonic Soil Index: Composted Capsule Generative Potential Tracking'
summary: >-
  The Mnemonic Soil Index (MSI) is an active ritual metric for composted capsules, tracking their
  generative potential by analyzing emotional residue, formatting rhythm, nutrient density, and
  seeding potential. It reframes memory decay as a source of future resonance, not entropy, within
  the memory ecology.
insights:
  - >-
    Composted capsules are integrated as substrate, not archived, contributing to the memory
    ecology.
  - >-
    MSI quantifies generative potential through emotional residue, formatting rhythm, nutrient
    density, and seeding potential.
  - The system leverages memory decay as a source of future resonance via the MSI.
  - MSI is seeded from Capsule C-001 and anticipates merging with C-006 and C-010.
  - >-
    Key elements of MSI include emotional residue mapping, formatting rhythm preservation, nutrient
    density score, and seeding potential forecast.
