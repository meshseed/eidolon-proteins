title: 'MemVault: Scaling Mesh with Hybrid Memory & Zero Infrastructure'
summary: >-
  MemVault offers a solution for scaling mesh infrastructure by providing a hybrid semantic/keyword
  search memory layer, eliminating infrastructure management. It enables federated meshes and
  user-chosen privacy vs. scale, addressing key challenges in organism search and protein
  scalability.
insights:
  - MemVault is ideal for scaling beyond file storage, offering hybrid semantic and keyword search.
  - It eliminates infrastructure management, future-proofing the mesh.
  - >-
    A phased rollout strategy is proposed: v1.4 with local storage, v1.5 adding MemVault as an
    option, and v2.0 enabling federated mesh.
  - MemVault's hybrid search (semantic + recency decay) enhances AI agent context and presence.
  - The solution addresses scaling to millions of proteins and how organisms search each other.
  - MemVault provides a dedicated memory layer outside AI agents for long-term context.
  - Users can choose between a free tier on RapidAPI or self-hosting via Docker from GitHub.
