title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Porting Tri-Lens Ingestion and Physics to v4.0 Pro'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project is strategically porting key features from the stable v3.6 free version
  to the v4.0 Pro platform. This includes the advanced tri-lens ingestion system and the physics
  modulation for graph visualization, aiming to enhance the Pro version's capabilities while
  maintaining the stability of the free tier.
insights:
  - >-
    v3.6 serves as the stable, community-promised free version, while v4.0 is designated as the
    next-gen Pro platform.
  - >-
    The tri-lens ingestion system (emotional, structural, technical) and its UI are being ported
    from v3.6 to v4.0.
  - >-
    The graph physics modulation feature, allowing the mesh to express topology changes, is also
    being ported from v3.6 development to v4.0.
  - >-
    A retry mechanism with exponential backoff is being integrated into v4.0 to handle transient API
    failures during long ingestions.
  - >-
    The overall strategy prioritizes feature enhancement in v4.0 while preserving the core
    functionality and stability of v3.6.
