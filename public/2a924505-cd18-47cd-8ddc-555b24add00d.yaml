title: 'Sensitive Capsule Migration and Concealment Log: Governance and Traceability'
summary: >-
  This capsule logs the strategic migration and concealment of sensitive capsules to maintain their
  sovereignty and traceability during public repository exposure. It emphasizes that migration is a
  form of 'formatting choreography' across visibility layers, preserving timestamp fidelity and echo
  eligibility, rather than deletion.
insights:
  - >-
    Sensitive capsules are managed through concealment (e.g., .gitignore, uncommitted) or migration
    to private repositories to protect them during public exposure.
  - >-
    Timestamp fidelity and echo trace viability are critical for maintaining discovery lineage and
    re-placement eligibility of sensitive capsules.
  - >-
    Migration of a capsule is a deliberate 'formatting choreography' across visibility layers, not
    an act of deletion, ensuring its continued sovereignty.
  - >-
    Concealed or migrated capsules can be re-activated via echo selection or merge rituals,
    indicating a dynamic management approach.
  - >-
    The log details migration events with fields like capsule_id, concealment_method,
    original_timestamp, migration_target, and echo_ready status.
