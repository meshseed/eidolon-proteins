title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Right Triangle Side Relationships'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean theorem, a² + b² = c², defines the fundamental relationship between the sides of a
  right triangle in Euclidean geometry, with 'c' representing the hypotenuse and 'a' and 'b' the
  legs. This axiom extends to distance formulas in multiple dimensions and underpins spatial
  reasoning.
insights:
  - Establishes a core algebraic relationship between the sides of any right triangle.
  - Forms the basis for calculating distances in Euclidean space, including higher dimensions.
  - Connects geometric properties (right angle) with algebraic representation (a² + b² = c²).
  - >-
    Integer solutions, known as Pythagorean triples, demonstrate specific whole-number
    relationships.
