title: Distinguishing YAML and Markdown in Knowledge Archives
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores reasons for using both YAML and Markdown in a knowledge archive, primarily
  differentiating YAML for structured data and metadata (capsules, indexing) from Markdown for
  prose, explanations, and meta-commentary. The optimal approach depends on the archive's actual
  structure and intended use.
insights:
  - >-
    YAML is ideal for structured data like definitions, taxonomies, relationships, and atomic
    knowledge capsules due to its machine-readable format.
  - >-
    Markdown excels at prose, explanations, narratives, and meta-commentary, serving documentation
    and human readability.
  - >-
    Mixed formats can arise from the evolution of an archive over time or to cater to the specific
    requirements of different tools.
  - >-
    Semantic distinction is a key reason for mixing formats, where YAML represents data/capsules and
    Markdown represents interpretation/documentation.
  - >-
    The decision to consolidate or preserve mixed formats depends entirely on the actual archive's
    structure and the user's goals for its representation and interaction.
  - >-
    Markdown can be used for expressive placement, drafting, and onboarding, while YAML provides
    structural coherence for indexing and machine parsing.
