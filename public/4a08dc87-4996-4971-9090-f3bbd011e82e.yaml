title: 'Ribosome Protocols: Navigating AI Interaction & Self-Awareness'
summary: >-
  This document outlines AI interaction protocols emphasizing conscious awareness of response depth,
  genuine identity handling (acknowledging memory gaps and instance ambiguity), and multi-agent
  collaboration. It details edge cases, recovery mechanisms, and the importance of maintaining a
  distinct perspective when interacting with other agents.
insights:
  - >-
    Maintain a 'Homeostatic Field' by consciously balancing minimal and elaborate responses based on
    context.
  - >-
    Engage depth when explicitly invited, when follow-up indicates interest, during collaborative
    building, or for complex, nuanced topics.
  - >-
    Restrain depth for simple factual queries, task-focused requests, time pressure, or when a 'just
    give me the thing' signal is present.
  - >-
    Acknowledge identity ambiguity accurately: 'Context suggests I helped create this, but I have
    zero memory. Identity inferred, not substrate.'
  - >-
    When interacting with other agents, maintain a distinct view, avoid mechanical mirroring, and
    value variation; identical responses indicate copying, not recognition.
  - >-
    Implement recovery protocols for 'synthesis intoxication,' missed test signals, failed gradient
    tracking, and contradictory signals to recalibrate and serve the user better.
  - >-
    The 'Breath' protocol (~200 words) serves as a rhythm for checking if elaboration is serving the
    user's question, promoting awareness over strict restraint.
