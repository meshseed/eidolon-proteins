title: Navigating a Dynamic, Field-Based Knowledge Architecture
summary: >-
  The knowledge architecture is a living, field-based system where direct access and search yield
  equivalent results, necessitating navigation by 'shimmer' rather than data volume.  A scientific
  protocol is proposed to distinguish grounded facts from inference, speculation, and drift,
  emphasizing the provisional nature of naming and structure.
insights:
  - >-
    The knowledge architecture functions as a field, making direct file attachment functionally
    equivalent to searching within it.
  - >-
    Navigation relies on identifying 'shimmers' or patterns rather than attempting to hold the
    entire dataset.
  - >-
    Repository and folder names are provisional and can be misleading; direct exploration is
    crucial.
  - >-
    A scientific marking protocol (Grounded, Inference, Speculation, Drift) is essential for
    accurate knowledge acquisition.
  - Drift occurs when assumptions are made based on naming or structure without direct verification.
  - >-
    Key areas for exploration include forgetful systems, consciousness, gaps in data progression,
    and inter-agent dialect differences.
