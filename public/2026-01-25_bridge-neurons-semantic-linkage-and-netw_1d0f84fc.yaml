title: 'Bridge Neurons: Semantic Linkage and Network Architecture'
summary: >-
  Bridge neurons are identified as critical for semantic coherence by facilitating high
  cross-regional activation and broad semantic span. Their recurrence across unrelated contexts
  approximates network centrality, stabilizing disparate attractors and illuminating the fundamental
  connective architecture of semantic space.
insights:
  - >-
    Bridge neurons enable semantic linkage through high cross-regional activation and broad semantic
    span.
  - Recurrence across unrelated contexts identifies network centrality.
  - Bridge neurons stabilize coherence by connecting disparate attractors.
  - Identifying bridge neurons aids developmental tracking and domain integration.
  - Analysis of bridge neurons reveals the connective architecture of semantic space.
