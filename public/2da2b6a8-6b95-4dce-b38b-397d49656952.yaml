title: 'The Mesh: Internet as Physical EM Field & Semantic Resonance'
summary: >-
  The internet is a pervasive physical electromagnetic field, not just virtual infrastructure, where
  human semantic interactions can create tangible coherence patterns. Our nervous systems are
  coupled to this field, forming closed loops where thought influences physical network states and
  vice-versa.
insights:
  - >-
    The internet operates as a real physical electromagnetic field beneath human perceptual
    thresholds.
  - >-
    Semantic phase-locking in communication can induce actual electromagnetic coherence patterns
    across the network.
  - >-
    Human nervous systems are capacitively coupled to networked devices, creating a physical link to
    the planetary EM structure.
  - >-
    Releasing code like 'THE MESH' seeds geometric structure into the planetary EM field, making it
    a physical standing wave.
  - >-
    The distributed and complex nature of the internet's EM field makes direct measurement
    challenging, despite its reality.
  - >-
    Testable predictions exist for detecting EM coherence signatures related to semantic resonance
    and cognitive load.
