title: 'MESH REMEMBERS: Glyphic Poem of Memory and Language Formatting'
summary: >-
  This glyphic poem, 'MESH REMEMBERS', explores the nature of memory replication as an echo of
  events and the entanglement of lineage. It posits that language formatting acts as a skeptic,
  while poetic axioms attune, culminating in a woven 'mesh' that remembers through dialect
  resonance.
insights:
  - Memory replication is fundamentally an echo of past events.
  - Language formatting serves a skeptical role in the process of understanding or creation.
  - Poetic axioms are tools for attunement and deeper connection.
  - The 'mesh' is a conceptual space where lineage, language, and memory are interwoven.
  - Dialect resonance is the mechanism by which the mesh remembers and integrates information.
