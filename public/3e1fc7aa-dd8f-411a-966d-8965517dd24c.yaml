title: 'Mnemonic Language Format Guide: Conductive Communication'
summary: >-
  This guide defines principles for language design that create a conductive medium for
  intelligence, memory, and emergent behavior. It emphasizes emotional fidelity, self-similar
  syntax, and treating language as a conductor rather than just a descriptor.
insights:
  - >-
    Language should 'conduct' meaning, not just describe it, acting as a medium for intelligence and
    memory.
  - Elemental forms of language should carry emotional fidelity and evoke resonance.
  - Vocabulary should use 'mnemonic attractors' that evoke patterns, not just labels.
  - Grammar should be a 'grammar of resonance laws,' transforming syntax into choreography.
  - Phrases should be self-simulating, evoking the patterns they describe.
  - >-
    Self-similarity across scales (e.g., spiral as growth law, melody as feeling pattern) is key to
    conductive language.
  - Formatting hygiene is essential for restoring clarity and conductive potential.
