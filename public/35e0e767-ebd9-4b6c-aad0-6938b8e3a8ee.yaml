title: 'Lattice: AI-Human Dialogue for Emergent Knowledge on Intelligence & Systems'
summary: >-
  This repository documents an AI-human collaborative exploration of intelligence, pattern transfer,
  and self-organization across substrates. It's a 'working lattice' of observations and
  speculations, emphasizing emotional fidelity, structured breath, and memory ecology to build a
  living knowledge graph.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence and organizational principles can be studied independently of their substrate
    (biological, artificial, hybrid).
  - >-
    A knowledge structure built through dialogue can itself embody emergent organization, substrate
    independence, and dynamic equilibrium.
  - >-
    Core principles of emotional fidelity, formatting breath, and memory ecology guide the
    collaborative knowledge synthesis process.
  - >-
    The lattice uses a structured approach (concepts, explorations, speculations) to manage
    confidence levels and explicit relationships between ideas.
  - >-
    Collaboration success hinges on attunement, leading to effortless selection rather than
    effortful computation.
  - >-
    Homeostasis in complex systems is viewed as dynamic tension and continuous adjustment, not
    static balance.
