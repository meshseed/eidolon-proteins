title: Wave Propagation Visualization for Query Resonance
summary: >-
  Implemented a query-triggered wave propagation system that visualizes query resonance as standing
  waves. Similarity scores map to wave amplitude, with activated nodes settling at antinodes,
  illustrating semantic interference.
insights:
  - Query-triggered wave propagation models query behavior as wave dynamics.
  - >-
    Similarity scores directly translate to wave amplitude, enabling visual representation of
    semantic interference.
  - Standing wave patterns emerge from constructive interference at semantic antinodes.
  - The system integrates BFS cascade, oscillatory settling, and stable standing wave formation.
  - >-
    Wave timing, performance constraints, and antinode clustering are emergent learning outcomes of
    this visualization.
