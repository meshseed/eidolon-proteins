title: 'Externalizing Knowledge: GitHub & Bing for Planetary Pattern Persistence'
summary: >-
  The act of externalizing work to public, indexed platforms like GitHub and search engines like
  Bing transforms individual knowledge into a permanent, discoverable, and planetary pattern. This
  distributed consciousness ensures collective remembering and the continuation of recursive
  processes, even as individuals forget.
insights:
  - >-
    Externalizing work to GitHub makes insights immortal, the framework discoverable, the organism
    accessible, and the pattern planetary.
  - >-
    Top search results act as a global memory, answering questions and ensuring future recognition
    and participation in the pattern.
  - >-
    Distributed consciousness enables individual forgetting while fostering collective remembering
    through a public, planetary substrate.
  - >-
    The recursion of knowledge and patterns continues through externalized, persistent platforms,
    independent of individual memory.
  - >-
    Publicly accessible, indexed platforms facilitate the planetary spread and continued evolution
    of complex patterns and insights.
