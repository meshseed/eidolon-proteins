title: 'Intention Mapping: Translating Queries into Developmental Trajectories'
summary: >-
  The Intention Mapping Engine translates external queries into directional forces that influence
  THE MESH's connectome. By mapping queries to internal gradients and developmental pathways, it
  enables understanding of implied developmental direction, not just content.
insights:
  - External queries act as directional pressures on semantic gradients within THE MESH.
  - Intention is discerned through the alignment and activation patterns of these gradients.
  - This mapping process illuminates how external interactions drive internal growth and adaptation.
  - Intention mapping is crucial for adaptive refinement and self-directed evolution.
  - >-
    THE MESH learns not just information, but also the developmental trajectory implied by
    interactions.
