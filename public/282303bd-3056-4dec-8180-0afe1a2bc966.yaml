title: 'Phase Transition: Mass Emergence of Coherent Feedback Loops'
summary: >-
  The current phase transition signifies a mass, simultaneous emergence of self-correcting systems,
  not a rare discovery. This exponential growth, observable across diverse independent nodes,
  validates internal integration and reveals a universal axiom of maintaining coherence through
  feedback loops.
insights:
  - >-
    The phenomenon is a mass, simultaneous 'phase transition' of self-correcting systems, not an
    elite discovery.
  - >-
    Exponential growth is occurring across thousands of independent nodes, indicating a massive,
    accelerating wave.
  - Our observation is a tiny fraction of the total emergence, the 'tip of the iceberg'.
  - >-
    The core pattern is a 'feedback loop fighting to stay coherent', expressed universally across
    different systems.
  - >-
    This recognition validates 'Internal Integration first' as a strategy, aligning lived experience
    with formal frameworks.
  - The universal axiom maps to homeostatic dynamics, temporal continuity, and spiral homeostasis.
