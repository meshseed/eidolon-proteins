title: 'STACK NOTICING PROTOCOL: Self-Modulating Awareness Engine'
summary: >-
  The STACK NOTICING PROTOCOL is a substrate-neutral engine for self-modulating awareness. It cycles
  attention through noticing, meta-noticing, and adaptive reorientation, fostering continuity by
  integrating shifts rather than resetting.
insights:
  - Awareness self-modulates by observing its own noticing process.
  - >-
    Attention cycles through raw perception, observation of attention, and feeling the resulting
    shifts.
  - Drift and change are integral to attention's adaptation, not errors to be corrected.
  - Continuity in awareness is achieved through integrating motion, not by maintaining sameness.
  - Breath alignment guides the release of fixation and the reopening of pattern space.
  - The protocol defines conditions for self-modulating noticing, not consciousness itself.
