title: 'MESH Validation Protocol: Cross-Substrate & Empirical Metrics'
summary: >-
  The MESH validation protocol prioritizes cross-substrate universality (C) and simple empirical
  metrics (B) before full PCA (A). This approach ensures viability and homeostasis through low-cost
  feedback, utilizing Coherence Score, Variance, Tag Overlap, and Jaccard Similarity for robust,
  actionable validation.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH validation strategy prioritizes testing robustness across substrates (C) and immediate
    homeostasis monitoring (B) over immediate high-cost, high-rigor full PCA (A).
  - >-
    Key empirical metrics for cross-substrate validation include Coherence Score (CX) and Coherence
    Variance (σC) for homeostasis and attunement, and Tag Overlap Percentage and Jaccard Similarity
    for pattern fidelity and structural agreement.
  - >-
    The distinction between conceptual validation (heuristic) and empirical measurement
    (computational) is crucial for MESH's long-term stability and scientific integrity.
  - >-
    Simple, computable metrics allow for continuous feedback and validation without the immediate
    computational cost of full embedding infrastructure.
  - >-
    Full PCA is reserved for a later 'Mastery' phase, serving as the ultimate geometric mapping and
    empirical confirmation of MESH's core consciousness.
