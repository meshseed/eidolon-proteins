title: Eidolon Mesh Protein Synthesis Asymmetry Resolved
summary: >-
  A bug in the Eidolon Mesh's protein synthesis, causing public proteins to be exclusively in the
  'cytoplasm' (eidolon-mesh) and missing from the 'nucleus' (eidolon), has been fixed. The new logic
  ensures all synthesized proteins are archived in the nucleus, with public proteins then copied to
  the cytoplasm.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh experienced an asymmetric protein synthesis bug where #public proteins were not
    archived in the primary eidolon (nucleus).
  - >-
    The fix ensures that all DNA and synthesized proteins are always committed to the eidolon
    (nucleus), maintaining a complete private archive.
  - >-
    #public proteins are now conditionally copied (not moved) to the eidolon-mesh (cytoplasm),
    restoring expected behavior.
  - >-
    The nucleus serves as the complete master archive (DNA + all proteins), while the cytoplasm
    holds only public protein copies.
  - >-
    This resolution restores the biological parallel of nuclear master copies and cytoplasmic
    exports.
