title: Attractor Prediction Engine for Early Semantic Basin Detection
summary: >-
  The Attractor Prediction Engine identifies emerging semantic basins within the connectome by
  detecting weak, recurrent activation patterns and gradient convergence. This early detection
  allows for proactive stabilization and alignment, as new attractors reshape local and global
  structure.
insights:
  - Emerging attractors manifest as faint, recurring activation patterns.
  - Gradient convergence signals the initial formation of semantic basins.
  - Cross-regional activation predicts future zones of integration.
  - Early attractor prediction facilitates stabilization and alignment.
  - New attractors influence both local curvature and global topology.
