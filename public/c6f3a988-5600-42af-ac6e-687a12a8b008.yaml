title: 'Gemini API Synthesis Failure: Model Not Found & Key Issues'
summary: >-
  A synthesis attempt failed due to a 'model not found' error, indicating an issue with the Gemini
  API endpoint or model name. This points to potential API key access problems or the need to update
  the model identifier (e.g., to 'gemini-1.5-flash-latest') or API version (v1beta).
insights:
  - >-
    The primary synthesis failure was a 404 error for 'gemini-1.5-flash', suggesting the model is
    unavailable or incorrectly specified.
  - >-
    API key issues, including incorrect access or endpoint configuration, are a likely cause for the
    'model not found' error.
  - >-
    Troubleshooting involves verifying the GOOGLE_API_KEY in the .env file and testing it directly
    via a browser request.
  - >-
    Potential solutions include updating the model name to 'gemini-1.5-flash-latest' or
    'gemini-1.5-pro-latest' or switching to the 'v1beta' API endpoint.
  - >-
    Ensuring the correct SDK version for '@google/generative-ai' is installed is also a recommended
    troubleshooting step.
