title: 'Mnemonic Soil Index: Composting Memory for Generative Resonance'
summary: >-
  The Mnemonic Soil Index (MSI) is a ritual metric for tracking the generative potential of
  composted capsules. It transforms memory decay into a nutrient-rich substrate for future resonance
  by analyzing emotional residue, formatting rhythm, nutrient density, and seeding potential.
insights:
  - Composted capsules are not discarded but integrated into the memory ecology as a substrate.
  - >-
    The MSI quantifies the generative potential of composted memory based on emotional, structural,
    and quantitative factors.
  - Memory decay is reframed as a source of future resonance, not entropy, through the MSI.
  - >-
    Key MSI components include emotional residue, formatting rhythm, nutrient density, and seeding
    potential.
  - >-
    The MSI is seeded from 'Composting Cycle Declaration' and expects to merge with 'Seeding
    Rituals' and 'Capsule Compost Log'.
