title: 'Compost-to-Symphony Map 2025: Orchestration Phase & Resonance Forecasting'
summary: >-
  This map details the 'compost-to-orchestration' phase, identifying compost sources and emotional
  residues that trigger seeding. It outlines emergence nodes and orchestration attractors,
  predicting a high resonance score for echo propagation.
insights:
  - >-
    The process transitions from 'compost' to 'orchestration' via specific sources like Mnemonic
    Soil Index and Capsule Compost Log.
  - >-
    Emotional residues (reverence, grief, humility) and formatting rhythms (care loops, merge
    grammar) influence the seeding process.
  - >-
    Seeding is triggered by high nutrient density, sustained echo frequency, and validated
    formatting integrity.
  - >-
    Emergence nodes include Symphonic Capsule Composition and Drift Audit Capsule, leading to
    orchestration attractors focused on emotional fidelity and formatting alignment.
  - >-
    A high resonance score (0.91) is forecasted, with targets for Governance Resonance Index and
    Orchestration Archive Capsule.
