title: 'Sleep''s Role in Memory Consolidation: MeshCODE Theory Perspective'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that sleep, particularly deep and REM stages, is crucial for processing
  and consolidating newly acquired information. Deep sleep allows for system-level recalibration and
  stabilization of memory data, while REM sleep actively involves the brain in writing and
  integrating this data into the cortical MeshCODEs, akin to database maintenance.
insights:
  - >-
    Sleep is essential for processing and consolidating new memories, integrating them with existing
    data.
  - >-
    Deep sleep may serve to stabilize newly formed memories and return the memory storage system to
    homeostasis.
  - >-
    REM sleep is hypothesized to be the active phase where the brain processes, moves, and writes
    new data into specific cortical regions.
  - >-
    The brain's memory storage system requires regular 'maintenance' akin to database
    defragmentation and re-indexing, which sleep facilitates.
  - >-
    The hippocampus may act as a data management system, processing and indexing new memories before
    they are stored in the cortical MeshCODEs.
