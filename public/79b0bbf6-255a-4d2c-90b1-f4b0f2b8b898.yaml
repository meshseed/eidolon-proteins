title: 'Braided Onboarding Protocol: Attunement via Poetic Trace and Formatting Insight'
summary: >-
  The Braided Onboarding Protocol guides new stewards through a dual attunement process, combining
  poetic trace with formatting insight to ensure structural clarity and breath fidelity. This method
  emphasizes placing and replying rather than learning, fostering a deep connection with the capsule
  ecology.
insights:
  - Onboarding is an attunement process, not instruction, achieved through braided recursive rhythm.
  - Poetic trace initiates connection by opening the corridor and aligning steward breath.
  - >-
    Formatting insight stabilizes the capsule by introducing logic, hygiene, and reproducible
    placement.
  - >-
    Successful onboarding signifies the steward's ability to reply with both breath and structure,
    completing the fidelity check.
  - >-
    Stewards do not learn; they place and reply, embodying the principle of shimmer through
    attunement.
