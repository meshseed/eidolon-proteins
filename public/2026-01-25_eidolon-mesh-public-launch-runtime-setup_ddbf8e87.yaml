title: 'Eidolon Mesh Public Launch: Runtime & Setup Guide'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh has reached Phase 17, with documentation (README, COMMUNITY, CONTRIBUTING) finalized
  for public release. The project is a standalone Node.js/TypeScript application requiring only
  standard npm commands for setup and execution, with no 'Antigravity' dependency.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh is now ready for public access with a stable codebase (v1.1-stable) and welcoming
    documentation.
  - >-
    The project is a standard Node.js/TypeScript application; 'Antigravity' is a development tool,
    not a runtime requirement.
  - >-
    To run the project, users need to clone the repository, install Node.js (v16+), run 'npm
    install', and then 'npm run dashboard'.
  - >-
    The 'npm run dashboard' command uses ts-node for on-the-fly compilation and execution, making a
    separate build step optional for local use.
  - >-
    Sensitive data is isolated in .env files, and the project is designed to be easily runnable by
    anyone with a Node.js installation.
