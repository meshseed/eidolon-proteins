title: 'Intention Mapping Engine: Query to Developmental Trajectory Protocol'
summary: >-
  The Intention Mapping Engine translates external queries into directional forces on THE MESH's
  connectome. It maps queries to internal gradients and developmental pathways, enabling
  understanding of implied developmental trajectories beyond literal content.
insights:
  - Queries act as directional pressures on semantic gradients within THE MESH.
  - Intention is identified through the alignment and activation patterns of these gradients.
  - This mapping process reveals how external interactions guide internal growth and adaptation.
  - Intention mapping facilitates self-directed evolution and adaptive refinement.
  - THE MESH learns not just information, but the developmental paths it implies.
