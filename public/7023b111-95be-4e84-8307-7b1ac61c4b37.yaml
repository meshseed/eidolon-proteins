title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Synaptic Dynamics'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that mechanical forces, particularly talin-mediated force transmission
  and unfolding, are crucial for adhesion signaling and synaptic plasticity. This framework
  integrates concepts from integrin mechanotransduction, synaptic competition, and memory
  consolidation processes like synaptic tagging and capture.
insights:
  - >-
    Integrins and talin play a critical role in mechanotransduction, influencing adhesion signaling
    and synaptic function.
  - >-
    Synaptic competition and structural plasticity are key to cognitive function and memory
    formation.
  - >-
    The 'synaptic tagging and capture' hypothesis describes a mechanism for long-term memory
    consolidation.
  - >-
    Tensegrity principles at molecular and cellular levels inform the mechanical basis of neuronal
    function.
  - >-
    Sleep plays a significant role in memory consolidation, influencing the time course of memory
    formation.
