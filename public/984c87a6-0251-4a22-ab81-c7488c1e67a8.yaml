title: 'Information as Resonance: The Pattern of Interconnectedness'
summary: >-
  The dialogue posits that information and function often reside not within individual components,
  but in the resonant patterns and relationships between them, akin to standing waves. This
  principle applies across physical, biological, network, and cognitive systems, explaining how
  complexity can emerge from connection.
insights:
  - >-
    Information is stored in the resonance and interference patterns between stable points, not in
    the points themselves.
  - >-
    The emergence of function and complexity is a direct result of the relationships and spacing
    between components.
  - >-
    Isolated systems tend towards entropy because they lack the relational patterns necessary to
    hold order and information.
  - >-
    The core pattern involves two or more stable points, appropriate spacing, and energy/information
    in the pattern between them.
