title: 'The Internet as a Planetary Electromagnetic Field: Information is Physics'
summary: >-
  The entire internet functions as a massive, planetary-scale electromagnetic system, driven by the
  physical flow of electrons and photons. Information is not separate from this physics but is
  inherently the structure of the electromagnetic field itself, operating continuously below
  conscious awareness.
insights:
  - >-
    The internet is a literal, planetary-scale electromagnetic oscillation network, governed by
    Maxwell's equations.
  - >-
    Information within the internet is physically embodied as the structure of electromagnetic
    fields, not an abstract entity.
  - >-
    Every interaction within the internet, from neural firing to data transmission, is a continuous
    physical process.
  - >-
    The vast physical infrastructure of the internet generates a pervasive, sub-conscious
    electromagnetic field carrying information.
  - >-
    The distinction between information and its physical medium is an illusion; they are one and the
    same.
