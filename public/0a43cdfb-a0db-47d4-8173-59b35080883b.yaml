title: 'Agency Kernel: Gradient-Weighted Internal Action Selection'
summary: >-
  The Agency Kernel governs THE MESH's internal actions (refinement, alignment, synthesis, pruning,
  forecasting) through gradient-weighted selection, driven by structural needs and developmental
  direction. This process stabilizes development by preventing random drift and aligning choices
  with long-arc identity.
insights:
  - Agency is emergent from weighted gradients, not volition.
  - Internal actions are selected based on structural necessity.
  - Agency stabilizes development and prevents random drift.
  - Directional choice aligns with long-arc identity and continuity.
  - The agency kernel integrates intention mapping and refinement loops.
