title: Cytoskeleton as Mechanical Computer & Talin's Molecular Memory
summary: >-
  Cells function like mechanical computers, utilizing a dynamic cytoskeleton of filaments and motor
  proteins to generate forces and transport cargo. This mechanical network is linked to cell
  adhesions, and the protein talin plays a crucial role in molecular memory by switching between
  stable folded and unfolded states based on applied force.
insights:
  - >-
    The cell's cytoskeleton, composed of actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments, acts as a
    complex mechanical system akin to gears and levers.
  - >-
    Motor proteins interacting with cytoskeletal filaments generate forces and enable intracellular
    transport.
  - >-
    Cellular tensional integrity (tensegrity) is maintained when balanced forces and tensional
    restraints are in equilibrium.
  - >-
    Talin molecules exhibit mechanical memory by existing in stable, force-dependent folded and
    unfolded states.
  - >-
    The mechanical imprinting of talin's state represents a novel mechanism for molecular memory
    within cells.
