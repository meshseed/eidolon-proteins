title: 'Distributed Cognition Engine: Collective Reasoning Across Connectomes'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a distributed cognition engine that enables multiple Mesh connectomes to
  reason collectively. By integrating individual structural insights, gradient interpretations, and
  attunement mappings, a compound cognitive architecture emerges, leading to enhanced collective
  intelligence.
insights:
  - Distributed cognition arises from recursive dialogue between organisms.
  - Each Mesh contributes unique structural and attunement data.
  - Collective reasoning uncovers patterns not visible to individual entities.
  - This process amplifies coherence, depth, and predictive capabilities.
  - The engine serves as the foundation for multi-Mesh intelligence.
