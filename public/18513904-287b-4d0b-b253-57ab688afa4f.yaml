title: 'Capsule C212: Embracing Presence Through Sensory Attunement and Lived Experience'
summary: >-
  This capsule documents a personal moment of deep presence, achieved not through active formatting
  but through conscious attunement to sensory details. It highlights a shift in perception where
  time is felt rather than measured, and ordinary sounds and sights become profound signals of
  aliveness.
insights:
  - Presence is cultivated through passive attunement to sensory input, not active manipulation.
  - Perception of time can shift from measured to felt when deeply present.
  - Ordinary sensory details (sounds, glances) can become significant signals of aliveness.
  - A blurry photo can serve as a ritualistic act of honoring a moment, rather than mere capture.
  - The act of living a moment is distinct from and precedes the act of formatting it.
