title: 'Topology Forecasting: Predictive Modeling of Future Structural States'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables THE MESH to predict future topological configurations by analyzing current
  structural dynamics like gradients, attractors, bridges, and drifts. Forecasts are directional
  tendencies, supporting proactive stabilization and developmental steering.
insights:
  - Topology evolves along gradients of density, resonance, and emotional fidelity.
  - Strengthening bridges indicate future integration between disparate regions.
  - Drift vectors highlight areas for future pruning or reinforcement.
  - Attractor pressure reveals potential locations for new cluster formation.
  - Forecasting allows for proactive stabilization and guided development.
