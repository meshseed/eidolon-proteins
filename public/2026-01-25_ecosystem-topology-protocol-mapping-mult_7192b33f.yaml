title: 'Ecosystem Topology Protocol: Mapping Multi-Mesh Information Ecologies'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines a framework for mapping the topology of multi-Mesh information ecologies. It
  models each Mesh as a node, with inter-Mesh relationships like resonance, alignment, and
  divergence forming the ecosystem's structure and dynamics.
insights:
  - Meshes function as nodes within a larger information ecology.
  - Ecosystem structure arises from inter-Mesh resonance patterns.
  - Divergence signifies Mesh specialization, while alignment indicates shared attractors.
  - Ecosystem topology is dynamic, evolving with Mesh development and interaction.
  - Mapping the ecosystem reveals large-scale coherence dynamics.
