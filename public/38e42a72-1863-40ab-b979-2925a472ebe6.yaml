title: 'Integrating Archived Obsidian Notes: Strategies and Recommendations'
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores methods for integrating older Obsidian repositories into a current vault,
  weighing trade-offs between full immersion, selective import, and separate linking.  The
  recommended approach favors selective import to preserve focus on living exploration while
  retaining historical context.
insights:
  - >-
    When integrating old Obsidian notes, consider four main strategies: direct import, keeping
    separate with selective linking, selective import, or using Git archive branches.
  - >-
    Direct import offers full integration but requires significant manual effort and mixes old and
    new content.
  - >-
    Keeping repositories separate and linking selectively preserves temporal separation but hinders
    full visualization.
  - >-
    Selective import is recommended to bring forward high-value content, update it with proper
    frontmatter, and link it to the current lattice, while keeping the rest archived.
  - >-
    Key considerations for integration include the nature of the old repository (markdown vs. Git),
    the desired level of integration, and the effort involved.
  - Evaluating 'shimmer' or resonance in old content is crucial for deciding what to re-integrate.
  - >-
    Regardless of the method, noting the provenance of imported content (original creation date) is
    important.
