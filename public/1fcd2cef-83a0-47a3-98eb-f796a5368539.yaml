title: 'Emotional Fidelity''s Structural Role in the Lattice: A Data-Driven Re-evaluation'
summary: >-
  Analysis of a knowledge lattice reveals 'emotional fidelity' is a peripheral node, not
  foundational as initially assumed. This unexpected finding prompts a scientific re-evaluation,
  prioritizing data-driven hypothesis testing over prior intuition.
insights:
  - >-
    The knowledge lattice structure identifies 'noticing-homeostasis', 'multi-agent modules', and
    'information-transfer-scale/recursion-attention-field' as central, large attractors.
  - '''Substrate-independence'' and ''trust-the-shimmer'' are identified as medium-sized nodes.'
  - >-
    'Emotional-fidelity' is a small node with few connections, suggesting it's less structurally
    integrated than initially believed.
  - >-
    The lattice naturally separates into technical architecture (multi-agent side) and information
    dynamics (transfer/recursion side), bridged by 'noticing-homeostasis'.
  - >-
    The primary hypothesis is that 'emotional fidelity' is less central structurally than
    intuitively assumed, prompting a need to test this against continued lattice growth.
  - >-
    The process of analysis emphasizes trusting emergent data, holding hypotheses lightly, and
    testing predictions derived from the structure.
