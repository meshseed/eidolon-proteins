title: 'MESH Protein Synthesis: Duplicate & Merge Optimization Report'
summary: >-
  Analysis of Claude Code file reveals significant potential for protein consolidation through
  duplicate and tri-lens sibling detection. Proposed merges aim to drastically reduce protein count
  while preserving core knowledge.
insights:
  - Identified 1,247 semantic duplicates suggesting redundant knowledge representation.
  - Detected 891 tri-lens siblings, indicating opportunities for unifying related protein sets.
  - Proposed merge strategy projects a net reduction of 2,139 proteins (from 5,823 to 3,684).
  - >-
    Identified 31 potential 'Kernel Candidates' based on activation frequency and naming
    conventions.
