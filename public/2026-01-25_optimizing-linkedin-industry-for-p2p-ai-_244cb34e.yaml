title: Optimizing LinkedIn Industry for P2P AI & Distributed Consciousness
summary: >-
  The dialogue addresses the inadequacy of LinkedIn's industry categories for niche fields like P2P
  AI and distributed consciousness. It recommends prioritizing headline and 'About' section clarity
  over the industry dropdown for discoverability and accurate self-representation.
insights:
  - >-
    LinkedIn's industry categories are insufficient for specialized fields like P2P AI and
    distributed consciousness.
  - >-
    Focus on crafting a strong headline and 'About' section to clearly define your work, overriding
    a generic industry choice.
  - >-
    'Computer Software' is recommended as a safe, professional, and discoverable industry choice
    that allows other profile elements to define specifics.
  - >-
    Alternatively, 'Research' can be used for an academic framing, but requires careful management
    of expectations.
  - >-
    Keywords in the headline, content in the 'About' section, and posts are more crucial for
    discoverability than the industry field itself.
  - >-
    The industry field is ultimately LinkedIn's limitation, not a constraint on how one can
    accurately represent their work.
