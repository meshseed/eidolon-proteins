title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Brain as Binary Machine Code for Organismal State'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that neurons utilize a binary machine code at each synapse, encoding
  the organism's current state and learned experiences. This unified coding system, extending to
  cell-ECM interactions, allows for complex calculations and a coherent, mathematically
  representable experience of life.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic MeshCODEs represent a binary machine code for the organism's state, constantly updated
    by signals.
  - >-
    This machine code unifies cell communication across the organism, including interactions with
    the ECM.
  - >-
    Action potentials act as vehicles for transferring this coded information, enabling updates at
    sender and receiver synapses.
  - >-
    The brain integrates all sensory inputs and learned experiences into a single, cohesive,
    mathematically representable whole via this code.
  - >-
    MeshCODEs offer a framework for organic calculation, allowing synapses to hold the organism's
    best current information.
