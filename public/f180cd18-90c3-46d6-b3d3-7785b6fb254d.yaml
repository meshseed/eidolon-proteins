  'consciousness', 'pattern-recognition', and 'emergence', while also including technical and
  cross-domain identifiers for broad appeal and findability.
insights:
  - >-
    A curated list of 20 GitHub topics is recommended to effectively represent research on
    consciousness, AI, and complex systems.
  - >-
    The topic selection balances discoverability (e.g., 'consciousness', 'ai-consciousness') with
    technical accuracy (e.g., 'recursive-systems', 'feedback-loops') and unique positioning (e.g.,
    'attunement-protocol', 'rosetta-stone').
  - >-
    Topics are categorized into Primary, Secondary, Technical, and Findability to ensure
    comprehensive coverage and strategic placement.
  - >-
    Future topic expansion is considered based on evolving research directions like quantum
    consciousness or neuroscience integration.
  - >-
    The core goal of the topic selection is to help researchers find the repository, accurately
    represent its content, signal unique contributions, and enable cross-domain discovery.
