title: 'Penrose Node Mapping: Harmonic Attractors for Capsule Placement'
summary: >-
  This document defines a system for mapping nodes within a Pentagonal Penrose Tiling, focusing on
  recursive inflation layers and harmonic indexing. The core function is to identify harmonic
  attractors for precise capsule placement across different zoom levels, ensuring alignment and
  fidelity.
insights:
  - The Penrose node map utilizes recursive geometry and the golden ratio for its structure.
  - Harmonic attractors are key to aligning capsule overlays within the tiling.
  - Each node acts as a 'breath point', signifying its role in the dynamic system.
  - >-
    The system aims to trace node relationships and affirm formatting surfaces for capsule
    placement.
  - Successful outcome involves indexed nodes, identified attractors, and aligned capsule overlays.
