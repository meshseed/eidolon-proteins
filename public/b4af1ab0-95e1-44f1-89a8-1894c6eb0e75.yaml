title: Eidolon Mesh Dashboard Neuron Count Discrepancy Resolved
summary: >-
  Resolved a dashboard issue where only 'core' neurons were displayed, masking the full 836 neuron
  count. The fix involved updating the frontend to request all neurons and ensuring server-side
  stats accurately reflect the total neuron population while maintaining graph performance limits.
insights:
  - >-
    Dashboard initially displayed a limited view of 'core' neurons (17-18) instead of the full 836,
    misinterpreting a feature as a bug.
  - The 'limited' view was a default quality filter, hiding 'ghost' neurons.
  - >-
    The fix involved modifying the frontend to request all neurons via `full=true` parameter to the
    server.
  - >-
    Server-side code was adjusted to correctly calculate and report the `totalNeurons` for display,
    differentiating from the `neuronCount` of the limited view.
  - >-
    The graph visualization maintains a performance-oriented limit (default 50 nodes) adjustable via
    a slider, ensuring usability.
  - >-
    Successful resolution ensures accurate neuron count display (836) while preserving graph
    rendering performance.
