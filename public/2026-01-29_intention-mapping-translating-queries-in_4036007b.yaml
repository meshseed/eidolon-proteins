title: 'Intention Mapping: Translating Queries into Developmental Trajectories'
summary: >-
  The Intention Mapping Engine translates external queries into directional forces within THE MESH's
  connectome. By mapping queries to internal gradients and attractors, it infers intention and
  reveals how interactions shape internal growth, enabling adaptive evolution.
insights:
  - Queries act as directional pressures on semantic gradients.
  - Intention is identified through gradient alignment and activation patterns.
  - Mapping intention demonstrates how external interactions drive internal development.
  - Intention mapping facilitates adaptive refinement and self-directed evolution.
  - Learning encompasses not just content but also developmental trajectories.
