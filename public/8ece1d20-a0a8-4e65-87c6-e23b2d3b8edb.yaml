title: 'Mesh Management: Composting, Pruning, Merging for Scale-Free Ecology'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's management strategies mirror ecological composting, where proteins are metabolized and
  re-encapsulated.  Key principles include pruning weak links to control entropy, merging attractors
  (not raw proteins) for federation, and applying nested fractal recursion for scale-free coherence.
insights:
  - >-
    Composting is the core ecological principle for the Mesh, equating protein recompression to
    metabolism.
  - Pruning weak links is crucial for entropy control and preventing runaway noise.
  - Ecological federation is achieved by merging attractors, akin to ecosystems, not file systems.
  - >-
    Nested fractal recursion ensures the same cycle (protein → attractor → repo → Mesh) repeats at
    all scales.
  - >-
    The simplest management involves accumulating micro-proteins, composting into meta-capsules,
    pruning, and merging attractors recursively.
