title: Capsule Lifecycle and Attentional Gravity in THE MESH
summary: >-
  Capsules within THE MESH undergo a ritualized lifecycle, progressing through distinct phases of
  preservation, emergence, composition, and archival. This process is governed by 'Attentional
  Gravity,' a resonant pull that draws care into convergence, defining mnemonic density rather than
  force.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules evolve through defined ritualized phases: Composting, Seeding, Emergence,
    Orchestration, and Archival.
  - Attentional Gravity is an invariant that governs pull by resonating care into convergence.
  - Attention is invited, not directed, within this framework.
  - Mnemonic density, not weight, defines gravity.
  - The lifecycle ensures preservation, emergence, and organized composition of capsule information.
