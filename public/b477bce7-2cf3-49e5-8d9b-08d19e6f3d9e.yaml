title: 'Knowledge Protein Synthesis: Public vs. Private Knowledge Strategy'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a three-part strategy for managing knowledge: keeping operational secrets
  private, carefully vetting personal information before sharing, and sharing conceptual frameworks
  publicly. It provides practical methods for curating a public repository by sanitizing personal
  data and focusing on distilled insights and interdisciplinary pattern convergence.
insights:
  - >-
    Operational knowledge (attunement protocols, collapse dynamics, personal craft) must be kept
    sovereign and private.
  - >-
    Personal information (names, lived experience, location) requires explicit consent before public
    sharing, necessitating a thorough privacy audit.
  - >-
    Conceptual frameworks, pattern recognition methods, and philosophical questions are safe and
    valuable for public dissemination.
  - >-
    A new, clean public repository is recommended for sharing distilled concepts, focusing on
    repository dives and translation layers, rather than directly publishing private notes.
  - >-
    Existing private repositories serve as rich sources for mining concepts, but should not be
    published directly; instead, they should be rewritten and anonymized for public consumption.
  - >-
    A vetting process involving privacy, sensitivity, maturity, and value checks is crucial before
    any knowledge is shared publicly.
  - >-
    Repository diving is a naturally safer public engagement method, focusing on observing and
    synthesizing others' work rather than revealing one's own operational details.
