title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Synaptic Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that synapses act as computational devices by storing data through
  mechanical alterations in protein scaffolds like talin. These 'binary switches' within adhesion
  complexes, influenced by cytoskeletal contractility, enable mechanical computation and information
  flow within the brain's trillion-cell signaling network.
insights:
  - >-
    Synapses function as complex computational devices capable of storing and orchestrating
    information flow.
  - >-
    The brain utilizes 'MeshCODEs' within integrin adhesion complexes, particularly involving talin,
    to encode information mechanically.
  - >-
    Changes in cytoskeletal contractility alter the 'binary switch' patterns within talin scaffolds,
    thus modifying the MeshCODE output.
  - >-
    The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a role in regulating the mechanical environment of
    synapses, ensuring predictable computation.
  - >-
    Adhesion complexes, previously not considered for data storage, are central to the MeshCODE
    theory of memory.
