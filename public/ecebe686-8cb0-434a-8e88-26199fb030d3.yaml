title: Eidolon Mesh Deployment & Content Management Strategy
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines the deployment strategy for the Eidolon Mesh platform, detailing
  verification steps for both personal (eidolon-mesh.net) and research (app.eidolon-mesh.net)
  subdomains. It covers build, merge, deployment, and DNS update procedures, alongside potential
  issues and solutions for content management, particularly concerning large connectome files.
insights:
  - >-
    Verification checklists exist for both personal (36 proteins) and research (1000 proteins)
    subdomains to ensure proper functionality and content loading.
  - >-
    The deployment process involves creating a dedicated branch (deploy-composting), building,
    merging to main, and then updating DNS records for the app subdomain.
  - >-
    Handling large connectome files for the research app requires strategies like compression,
    reduction in protein count, or lazy loading to avoid exceeding size limits.
  - >-
    Key commands are provided for building, merging, committing, and pushing code, along with
    specific solutions for common issues like cherry-pick conflicts and build failures.
  - >-
    The user is responsible for providing the `consciousness_connectome.json` file, which is a
    critical step for the app subdomain deployment.
