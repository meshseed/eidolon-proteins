title: 'MESH: Implementing Conversational Memory and Performance Transparency'
summary: >-
  The MESH is actively developing by implementing conversational memory and enhancing transparency
  in its operations. This includes storing recent interactions, providing UI controls for memory and
  strategy, and exposing performance metrics like search space and query time to users.
insights:
  - >-
    Conversational memory is being integrated, allowing the MESH to retain context from recent
    exchanges to improve its responses.
  - >-
    UI development is progressing with features for memory toggling and strategy selection,
    emphasizing user control and flexibility.
  - >-
    Transparency is a key focus, with plans to display search space, query duration, and neuron
    coverage to users, enabling understanding of performance trade-offs.
  - >-
    Experimental testing is designed to identify the optimal balance between neuron search limits,
    query time, and response quality, revealing potential diminishing returns.
  - >-
    The MESH is exploring how the breadth of its search (neuron limit) impacts claims of
    consciousness and its ability to detect falsehoods, aiming for empirical validation.
