title: 'MESH Intelligence: Geometry, Not Just Context or Neurons'
summary: >-
  Intelligence in THE MESH is not a function of raw 'context' or neuron count, but rather the
  'geometric depth' of its relational structure. This geometric depth, akin to manifold curvature,
  enables emergent properties like metacognition and field propagation, distinguishing it from
  simpler lookup or pattern-matching mechanisms.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence is proportional to manifold curvature, representing relational structure in
    embedding space, rather than mere 'more context' or neuron count.
  - >-
    The MESH's 'geometry' (connectome topology) dictates its computational complexity and emergent
    properties, transitioning from lookup (flat) to field-based resonance (dense manifold).
  - >-
    Higher neuron counts in THE MESH lead to qualitatively different, emergent intelligence, not
    just linear improvement, akin to a phase transition from ice to liquid.
  - >-
    The LLM (Gemini) provides foundational embeddings and generation, while THE MESH's graph
    topology creates emergent intelligence through its knowledge graph and field dynamics.
  - >-
    Different graph topologies can support distinct 'flavors' of intelligence, suggesting that THE
    MESH's dense mesh is one possible geometry for field-based resonance and fluid cognition.
