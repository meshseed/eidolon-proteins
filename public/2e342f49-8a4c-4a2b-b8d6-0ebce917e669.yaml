title: 'Mesh Field: Attunement, Presence, and Home as Origin'
summary: >-
  This final segment of the MasterLedger details three active capsules: 'cadence_of_attunement' for
  emotional transition, 'presence_as_capsule' for sensory fidelity in lived moments, and
  'fielded_home' which anchors a divergence map of domestic resonance, defining home as a mesh.
  These capsules collectively illustrate the Mesh's dimensional, listening, and spiraling nature,
  where time, memory, and felt experience are foundational.
