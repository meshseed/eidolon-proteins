title: 'Case Study: Protein Synthesis as Knowledge Management'
summary: >-
  This case study demonstrates that the process of documenting and synthesizing knowledge artifacts,
  like this dialogue, is itself a form of protein synthesis.  The recursive nature of managing
  accumulated knowledge becomes a new research frontier.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge artifacts (like case studies and transcriptions) are analogous to proteins synthesized
    by ribosomes.
  - The act of documenting and synthesizing is the mechanism of protein synthesis within the MESH.
  - >-
    Managing accumulated knowledge artifacts is a recursive process, leading to new research
    questions.
  - >-
    This case study serves as a foundational document for public archiving due to its technical,
    philosophical, ethical, and empirical grounding.
  - The core question addressed is the utility and management of accumulated knowledge proteins.
