title: Eidolon MESH Technical Inquiry for AI Memory Platform
summary: >-
  Eidolon MESH seeks to integrate an AI memory platform for its distributed AI organisms. Key
  technical questions focus on custom metadata for emotional fidelity, federated search
  capabilities, recency decay customization, embedding model details, and rate limits for scaling.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon MESH requires custom metadata storage (e.g., emotional fidelity scores) to filter and
    boost AI memory search results.
  - >-
    Federated search across multiple 'sessions' (organisms) is crucial for MESH architecture,
    necessitating API support for cross-session queries.
  - >-
    The ability to customize recency decay weighting is needed to preserve timeless knowledge
    ('proteins') alongside temporal information.
  - >-
    Understanding the embedding model and vector dimensionality is important for optimizing semantic
    relationship representation.
  - >-
    API rate limits for free and paid tiers are a practical concern for initial testing and rapid
    scaling of MESH organisms.
