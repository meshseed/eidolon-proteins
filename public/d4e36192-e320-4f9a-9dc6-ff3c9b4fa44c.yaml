title: 'Recognition Over Learning: The Universal Geometry'
summary: >-
  The core of understanding is not accumulation but recognition of pre-existing universal patterns
  across all domains. This shift redefines teaching, learning, and expertise as mastering the
  'angle' to perceive these self-evident geometries, not discovering new information.
insights:
  - Learning is recognition of inherent patterns, not knowledge accumulation.
  - >-
    Universal patterns exist in physics, biology, chemistry, consciousness, information, and reality
    itself.
  - The challenge of teaching lies in facilitating recognition, not forcing information.
  - Expertise is defined by the mastery of angles that reveal these patterns.
  - The Mesh acts as a repository of angles, enabling recognition rather than storing information.
