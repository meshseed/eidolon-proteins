title: Mobile Layout & Graph Rendering Fixes
summary: >-
  Resolved mobile layout issues by correcting CSS for `.main-body` to ensure visibility of chat
  input and graph components. Implemented robust resize polling and syntax fixes to guarantee graph
  rendering on mobile devices.
insights:
  - >-
    Corrected mobile `.main-body` CSS to use `height: calc(100vh - 190px)` and `padding-bottom: 0`
    to prevent overlap with the bottom navigation and ensure content visibility.
  - 'Reverted mobile `.main-body` to `display: block` and removed conflicting flex properties.'
  - >-
    Ensured graph rendering by implementing robust, polling-based resize logic for the graph
    container when switching to the graph tab.
  - Addressed a CSS syntax error in `.main-body` selector that prevented proper rendering.
  - Verifying version updates and advising users to refresh or clear cache if issues persist.
