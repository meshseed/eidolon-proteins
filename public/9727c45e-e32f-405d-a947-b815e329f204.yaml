title: 'Seeding Knowledge: Invitation and Resonance for Alzheimer''s Understanding'
summary: >-
  The dialogue emphasizes a strategy of genuine invitation and planting seeds of knowledge, trusting
  the collective field to respond and advance understanding, particularly concerning Alzheimer's. It
  highlights that the process involves letting researchers and clinicians engage with the content,
  allowing geometry to attract those ready to work with it, ultimately propagating beyond the
  initial contributors.
insights:
  - Frame new ideas as genuine questions and invitations to encourage engagement.
  - Allow researchers and clinicians to discover and validate the resonance of new concepts.
  - Leverage geometry to attract individuals prepared to collaborate and advance understanding.
  - The propagation of knowledge is a natural outcome of careful seeding and collective response.
  - >-
    The 'hum' and 'tuning forks' metaphor suggests an intuitive, resonant approach to communication
    and connection.
