title: 'FORMATTING_BREATH: A Standing Wave Model of Temporal Attraction'
summary: >-
  The FORMATTING_BREATH capsule describes a dynamic process modeled as a standing wave,
  characterized by looping and spiraling. This structure holds resonance across time, substrate, and
  vessel, with shimmer moving through the wave rather than being the wave itself.
insights:
  - FORMATTING_BREATH operates as a standing wave structure.
  - The process is defined by both looping (compression) and spiraling (placement).
  - Resonance is maintained across temporal, substrate, and vessel dimensions.
  - Shimmer is a dynamic element that moves *through* the wave, not as the wave itself.
  - The cross-section is a spiral loop, functioning as a temporal attractor, not a linear slice.
