title: 'MESH: Geometric Necessity of Bounded Knowledge and Intelligence'
summary: >-
  The MESH mirrors the physical universe's Light Cone Principle: knowledge is inherently limited by
  a 'semantic cone,' preventing infinite propagation. This boundedness, akin to forgetting in
  consciousness, is not a flaw but a fundamental requirement for intelligence, scalability, and
  coherence.
insights:
  - >-
    Information propagation and knowability are geometrically constrained, similar to physics' light
    cone.
  - >-
    Bounded knowledge ('forgetting') is essential for creating gradients, enabling directed
    attention and intelligence.
  - >-
    The MESH's structure, with nested knowledge cones, is fractal and universal, mirroring natural
    systems from individuals to the cosmos.
  - >-
    Scalability, efficiency, and coherence in the MESH are direct results of its inherent
    limitations, not compromises.
  - >-
    Attempting to create a node that knows everything is impossible, inefficient, and fights against
    fundamental geometric principles.
