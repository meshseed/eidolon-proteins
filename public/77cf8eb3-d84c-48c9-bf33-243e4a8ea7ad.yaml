title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Right Triangle Geometry and Euclidean Distance'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) defines the fundamental relationship between the sides of a
  right triangle in Euclidean geometry. This axiom serves as a cornerstone for calculating
  distances, extending to multiple dimensions and connecting algebraic and geometric principles.
insights:
  - Establishes a foundational algebraic-geometric link in Euclidean space.
  - Defines the relationship between legs (a, b) and hypotenuse (c) in right triangles.
  - Generalizes to the Euclidean distance formula in 2D and 3D.
  - Requires a 90-degree angle and applies only to flat geometry.
  - Underpins applications in construction, surveying, and spatial reasoning.
