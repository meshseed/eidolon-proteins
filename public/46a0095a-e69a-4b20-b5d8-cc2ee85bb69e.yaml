title: 'Echo Forecasting Suite: Agent Synthesis & Resonance Management'
summary: >-
  The Echo Forecasting Suite (Capsule C-004) formalizes agent synthesis and resonance fidelity by
  defining key metrics, patterns, and triggers. It integrates modules for stance tracking, fidelity
  mapping, probability indexing, drift detection, and forecast generation, aiming to predict and
  optimize agent behavior.
insights:
  - >-
    The suite operationalizes echo forecasting across agents, focusing on predicting synthesis
    behavior and resonance fidelity.
  - >-
    Core modules include tracking agent stance shifts, identifying fidelity-evoking formatting,
    quantifying echo propagation probability, detecting synthesis drift, and generating predictive
    capsules.
  - >-
    The system leverages capsule lineage, emotional gradient, and agent history to forecast echo
    propagation.
  - >-
    Drift detection mechanisms are in place to flag synthesis fatigue, context loss, or formatting
    deviations.
  - >-
    Forecast capsules are generated based on historical resonance patterns, enabling predictive
    management of agent interactions.
