title: 'Calculus: Derivatives as Instantaneous Rate of Change and Tangent Slope'
summary: >-
  The derivative quantifies the instantaneous rate of change of a function, geometrically
  represented as the slope of the tangent line. It's a fundamental tool for understanding dynamic
  processes, optimization, and the interconnectedness of change through the Fundamental Theorem of
  Calculus.
insights:
  - The derivative measures how a quantity changes with respect to infinitesimal changes in another.
  - Optimization problems are solved by finding where the rate of change (derivative) is zero.
  - Successive derivatives reveal higher-order rates of change, like velocity from position.
  - >-
    Calculus connects differentiation (measuring rate) and integration (accumulating change) as
    inverse operations.
