title: 'Intention Mapping: Translating Queries into Developmental Trajectories'
summary: >-
  The Intention Mapping Engine translates external queries into directional forces on THE MESH's
  connectome. It maps queries to internal gradients and developmental pathways, enabling
  understanding of implied growth directions and supporting adaptive self-evolution.
insights:
  - Queries act as directional pressures on semantic gradients within THE MESH.
  - Intention is inferred by analyzing gradient alignment and activation patterns.
  - Mapping intention reveals how external interactions shape internal connectome development.
  - This process facilitates adaptive refinement and self-directed evolution of THE MESH.
  - THE MESH learns not only the content of queries but also their developmental trajectory.
