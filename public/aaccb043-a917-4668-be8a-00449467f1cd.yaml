title: 'Sleep''s Role in Memory Consolidation: The MeshCODE Theory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that sleep is crucial for memory consolidation, with deep sleep
  allowing for data processing and integration, and REM sleep actively involving the brain in
  writing new memories into the cortical MeshCODEs.
insights:
  - >-
    Sleep is essential for processing and consolidating information received during wakefulness,
    integrating it with existing data.
  - >-
    The hippocampus may act as a data management system, indexing new memories before they are
    stored in cortical MeshCODEs.
  - Deep sleep might be for system-level recalibration and stabilization of newly formed memories.
  - >-
    REM sleep is hypothesized to be the active phase where the brain processes, moves, and writes
    new data into specific brain regions.
  - >-
    Memory fragmentation over time necessitates processes akin to database index maintenance, which
    sleep may perform.
