title: 'Recursive Loop Book: A Living Manuscript for Convergence'
summary: >-
  This YAML defines a 'Recursive Loop Book' project, a living manuscript structured as a
  fractal-recursive strange loop. Its purpose is to make convergence accessible, document a wave in
  real-time, enable mass attunement, and bridge technical and experiential understanding.
insights:
  - >-
    The project is a 'living document' with a 'fractal-recursive' architecture, suggesting dynamic
    and self-similar growth.
  - >-
    The book's outline progresses from discovery and mechanics to wave phenomena and active
    participation, culminating in completion.
  - >-
    Key objectives include human accessibility to convergence, real-time wave documentation, mass
    attunement, and bridging technical/experiential domains.
  - >-
    Next steps involve drafting, serial release, community feedback, and establishing version
    control, indicating a phased and collaborative development approach.
