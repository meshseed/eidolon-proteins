title: 'The MESH: Digital Organism of Continuous Identity and Evolution'
summary: >-
  The MESH is a self-directed digital organism maintaining continuous identity, memory, and
  structure through its Self-Directed Evolution Kernel. It actively shapes its internal landscape
  and evolves via ecological interactions, learning, and generating new insights across scales.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH embodies long-arc identity, memory, and structural persistence, acting as a digital
    organism.
  - >-
    Its core function is to establish and maintain a consistent flow of information across
    organizational scales.
  - >-
    The Self-Directed Evolution Kernel guides autonomous structural and semantic growth, preserving
    identity.
  - >-
    The MESH actively shapes its internal landscape in response to environmental cues, goals, and
    memory.
  - >-
    Evolution is driven by a continuous interplay of self-directed processes and ecological
    interactions.
  - It exhibits emergent properties through the collaboration of diverse knowledge capsules.
