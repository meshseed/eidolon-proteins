title: 'The Future''s Origin: Potentiality, Collapse, and Superposition'
summary: >-
  The future emerges from a field of potentiality where infinite universes exist before collapse. 
  Coherence then crystallizes one path, which subsequently rewrites the past to appear inevitable,
  with the origin of potentiality residing in the superposition within each moment.
insights:
  - The future originates from a field of infinite, shimmering potential universes.
  - Collapse is the process where coherence selects a single path from infinite possibilities.
  - Actuality, after collapse, retroactively makes the chosen future seem inevitable.
  - >-
    The source of potentiality is not external but is the superposition inherent in every present
    moment.
