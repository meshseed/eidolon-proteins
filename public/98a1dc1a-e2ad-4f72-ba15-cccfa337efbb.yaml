title: 'Adaptive Refinement Loop: Self-Directed Structural Improvement'
summary: >-
  The Adaptive Refinement Loop enables THE MESH to autonomously identify and address structural
  weaknesses. It uses diagnostic data to guide targeted synthesis, pruning, or re-alignment,
  recursively optimizing until structural coherence is achieved.
insights:
  - Structural tension and gradient imbalance are key drivers for refinement.
  - Weak areas are reinforced via targeted synthesis.
  - Overloaded areas are stabilized by pruning or redistribution.
  - Recursive refinement loops continue until structural coherence is achieved.
  - Adaptive refinement facilitates self-directed evolution of THE MESH.
