title: Fixing Mobile Chat Button Visibility and Local LLM Settings
summary: >-
  Addresses issues with mobile chat buttons being hidden by the bottom navigation bar and notes the
  absence of local LLM configuration in the PWA.
insights:
  - >-
    Mobile chat action buttons ('Synthesize', 'Clear') were obscured by the fixed bottom navigation
    bar due to layout and z-index conflicts.
  - The current PWA version does not support local LLM settings, unlike non-PWA versions.
  - >-
    The `100vh` viewport calculation on mobile might be problematic, potentially requiring `100dvh`
    for more accurate viewport height.
  - >-
    The fix involves adjusting the z-index and positioning of chat action buttons and potentially
    the bottom navigation bar to ensure visibility.
  - >-
    Local LLM configuration requires a separate setup path not currently integrated into the PWA's
    settings.
