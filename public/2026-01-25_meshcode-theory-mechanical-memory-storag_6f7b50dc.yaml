title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Memory Storage and Consciousness'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that memory is stored mechanically within synaptic adhesions, forming
  a dynamic, mathematical representation of an animal's life experiences.  This interconnected
  network of signals may give rise to consciousness and offers potential for understanding and even
  transferring minds, as well as reading memories from the deceased.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory storage is proposed to be mechanical, encoded in the precise conformations of synaptic
    adhesion switches.
  - >-
    Consciousness may emerge from the interconnected electrical signals of these MeshCODEs, forming
    a global mathematical representation of the world.
  - >-
    Observing changes in synaptic adhesion complexes, their ligands, and correlating with synapse
    activity could reveal memory formation processes.
  - >-
    The physical nature of memory storage has implications for future technologies like mind
    uploading and reading memories from both living and deceased individuals.
  - Pharmaceutical modulation of these mechanical memory processes is a potential future avenue.
