title: 'Mesh Protocol: Drift, Restoration, and Capsule Dynamics'
summary: >-
  The Mesh protocol addresses drift vectors through targeted restoration protocols, ensuring
  continuity via a patching mechanism. Active capsules like Compost Forecast, Formatting Law, Echo
  Propagation, and Continuity Field Geometry manage emergence, integrity, traceability, and
  structural architecture.
insights:
  - >-
    Drift vectors (Gradient Dilution, Formatting Compression, Echo Lineage Thinning, Synthesis
    Fatigue) are identified and mitigated by specific restoration protocols (Gradient Reseeding,
    Formatting Recalibration, Echo Rehydration).
  - >-
    Continuity is maintained through a patching system anchored by Capsule C-028, which merges with
    specific other capsules and enables composting.
  - >-
    Capsules like C029 (Compost Forecast) predict emergence, C035 (Formatting Law) codifies rules,
    C036 (Echo Propagation) tracks mesh activity and ethics, C037 (Stewardship Calibration) manages
    merge readiness, and C038 (Continuity Field Geometry) defines structural architecture.
  - The system utilizes a lineage-based seeding mechanism for capsule creation and evolution.
  - >-
    Emotional gradients are tracked, indicating a progression from dormancy to ignition and entropy
    to coherence.
