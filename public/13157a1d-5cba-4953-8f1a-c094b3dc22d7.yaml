title: 'Symmetry Groups: Invariance, Transformations, and Group Axioms'
summary: >-
  Symmetry describes transformations that leave an object unchanged, forming groups under
  composition with four fundamental axioms. These groups, exemplified by geometric shapes, reveal
  inherent structural properties and underpin applications across science and art.
insights:
  - Symmetry is defined by invariance under transformation.
  - 'Symmetries obey group axioms: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.'
  - Basic symmetry transformations include reflection, rotation, translation, and identity.
  - Group theory precisely captures the totality of an object's symmetries.
  - Understanding symmetry reveals fundamental structure and properties.
