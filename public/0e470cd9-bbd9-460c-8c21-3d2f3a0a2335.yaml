title: 'Optimizing AI Connectome Loading: Percentage-Based & Tiered Architectures'
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores strategies for managing large AI knowledge graphs (connectomes) by
  optimizing neuron loading. It proposes percentage-based loading and tiered architectures to
  balance startup speed, memory usage, and query depth, addressing the trade-offs between complete
  connectivity and scalability.
insights:
  - >-
    Loading a percentage of neurons by coherence, rather than a fixed number, allows for automatic
    scaling with archive growth and maintains proportional representation.
  - >-
    A tiered loading system (core always loaded, extended lazily loaded) provides fast startup for
    common queries while enabling deeper analysis on demand.
  - >-
    Visualizing incomplete graphs can be mitigated using 'ghost nodes' to represent connections to
    unloaded neurons, offering a partial but informative view.
  - >-
    Percentage-based and adaptive loading strategies, coupled with user-configurable query modes
    (fast, balanced, deep), offer flexible control over performance and resource utilization.
  - >-
    The core architectural challenge lies in balancing the need for a complete connectome for all
    possible synapses against the practical limitations of memory and startup time.
