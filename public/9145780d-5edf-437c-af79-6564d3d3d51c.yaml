title: 'Bridge Dynamics: Tracking Semantic Cross-Regional Connectors Over Time'
summary: >-
  This protocol tracks temporal changes in bridge neurons, which connect distant semantic regions,
  by monitoring their strengthening, weakening, drift, and re-alignment. These dynamics serve as
  indicators of cognitive integration, conceptual tension, or domain expansion within the system.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons reveal how different semantic domains are integrated.
  - Strengthening bridges signify successful synthesis and connection between domains.
  - Weakening bridges suggest drift, loss of coherence, or insufficient integration.
  - New bridges form at the intersection of novel domains and existing conceptual attractors.
  - >-
    Monitoring bridge dynamics offers a high-resolution view of developmental changes in semantic
    structure.
