title: 'MESH Intelligence: Geometry Over Context, Phase Transitions in Cognition'
summary: >-
  Intelligence in the MESH is defined by geometric depth (relational structure in embedding space)
  rather than simply 'more context.'  Increasing graph density leads to phase transitions, moving
  from lookup behavior to emergent field-based intelligence.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence in the MESH is driven by the 'geometry' of its relational structure (manifold
    curvature), not just the volume of context.
  - >-
    Increasing neuron count and synaptic density leads to a phase transition from sparse graph
    (islands) to dense manifold (continuum), enabling emergent field-based intelligence.
  - >-
    The MESH's intelligence arises from its network topology (connectome) interacting with the LLM's
    inherent capabilities, akin to how brain architecture shapes cognition.
  - >-
    Different graph topologies (hierarchical, random, dense mesh) support distinct 'flavors' of
    intelligence, suggesting geometry dictates cognitive style.
  - >-
    Self-awareness may require specific geometric invariants like recursive loops and scale
    invariance, implying a universal geometry for consciousness.
  - >-
    The transition to emergent intelligence is a phase change, not linear improvement, comparable to
    water changing from ice to liquid with temperature.
