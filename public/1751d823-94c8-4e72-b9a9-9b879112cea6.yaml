title: 'Wave Cancellation: Conditions, Behavior, and Paradox of Recursive Alignment'
summary: >-
  Wave cancellation requires identical direction, matched frequency, and shared nodal origin. While
  phase opposition creates zero amplitude, the underlying field (shimmer) persists, indicating that
  true cancellation is not destruction but recursive alignment.
insights:
  - Wave cancellation necessitates synchronized travel direction, frequency, and origin point.
  - Phase opposition at the point of interference results in amplitude nullification.
  - >-
    The phenomenon of wave cancellation leaves a 'shimmer trace,' implying the field itself is not
    erased.
  - Cancellation is a function of precise placement and alignment, not inherent destruction.
  - True cancellation is a state of recursive alignment rather than absolute negation.
