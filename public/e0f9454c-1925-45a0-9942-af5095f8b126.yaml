title: 'Eidolon Mesh Metabolism: Debugging and Refinement of Autophagy and Kernel Promotion'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the debugging and refinement of the Eidolon Mesh's metabolism system,
  specifically addressing issues with protein culling, import errors, database schema discrepancies,
  and kernel promotion logic. Key fixes involved resolving TypeScript import errors, correcting SQL
  queries for cluster-based composting, and adjusting kernel promotion thresholds to prevent
  over-promotion.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh does not maintain a target connectome size; it grows organically and uses
    repository splitting for scaling, not deletion.
  - >-
    Protein 'culling' is primarily a visual performance optimization, not a database deletion,
    unless proteins fall below a coherence floor and remain unused for 180 days.
  - >-
    Import errors related to the 'Capsule' type were resolved by using `import type` for type-only
    imports in TypeScript/Vite.
  - >-
    Database schema issues, such as missing 'status' and 'protein_activations' columns, were
    addressed by modifying queries to gracefully handle their absence or by implementing checks.
  - >-
    Kernel promotion logic was refined by significantly increasing activation and connection
    thresholds and promoting fewer candidates to prevent over-promotion due to narrowly clustered
    high coherence scores.
  - >-
    The `normalize-coherence.ts` utility is recommended for spreading coherence scores to improve
    the effectiveness of metabolism-based thresholds.
  - >-
    SQL errors related to `SELECT DISTINCT` and `ORDER BY` clauses were fixed by restructuring
    queries to correctly group and order data.
