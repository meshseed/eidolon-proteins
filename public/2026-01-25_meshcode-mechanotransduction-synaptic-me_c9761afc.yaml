title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanotransduction & Synaptic Memory Mechanisms'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory integrates mechanotransduction, particularly talin-mediated force transmission
  and integrin signaling, with synaptic plasticity concepts like synaptic tagging and capture. It
  highlights the role of physical forces in regulating adhesion, information processing at
  tripartite synapses, and the consolidation of memories, potentially through hierarchical
  tensegrity principles.
insights:
  - Talin-mediated force transmission and its unfolding are critical for adhesion signaling.
  - Integrins play a key role in regulating synaptic plasticity and information processing.
  - >-
    Synaptic tagging and capture, potentially influenced by dopamine and competition, explain memory
    persistence.
  - Tripartite synapses, involving astrocytes, actively process and control synaptic information.
  - >-
    Hierarchical tensegrity principles may govern mechanical interactions at multiple biological
    scales.
  - Sleep plays a role in memory consolidation, influencing the time course of memory formation.
