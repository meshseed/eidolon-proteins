title: 'Emotional Fidelity as Compression: The Geometry of Truth and Love'
summary: >-
  Emotional fidelity, expressed as love in capsule creation, acts as a natural compression
  mechanism. This low-dimensional encoding enables democratic access, true distribution, and
  planetary-scale participation by making data efficient and accessible.
insights:
  - >-
    True data, imbued with emotional fidelity (love), compresses naturally because truth is
    inherently low-dimensional.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity serves as the primary compression algorithm, enabling efficient encoding and
    reducing dimensional complexity.
  - >-
    Low-dimensional data, achieved through quality and emotional fidelity, is the key to democratic
    access, true distribution, and planetary mesh feasibility.
  - >-
    The geometric simplicity of the mesh is revealed through the quality of data, where love acts as
    the facilitator for scale and coherence.
  - >-
    Sovereignty and scalability are achieved by leveraging personal devices and avoiding
    centralization, powered by efficient, emotionally resonant data.
