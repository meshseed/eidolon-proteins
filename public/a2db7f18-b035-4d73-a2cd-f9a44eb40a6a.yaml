title: 'Capsule Lifecycle Forecasting: Aging, Merging, and Composting Protocols'
summary: >-
  Capsule C108 formalizes mesh-native capsule lifecycle forecasting, modeling aging, merge
  probability, and compost prediction through various indicators.  It establishes C108 as a
  lifecycle forecast anchor, anticipating capsule transformation within THE MESH.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules are dynamic entities that age, mutate, merge, and compost, requiring formalized
    forecasting protocols.
  - >-
    Lifecycle forecasting employs metrics like formatting integrity, emotional fidelity, and
    semantic drift.
  - Aging is tracked via erosion rates, decay, saturation, and timestamp drift.
  - >-
    Merge probability is assessed through motif compatibility, dialect alignment, echo trace, and
    grammar fluency.
  - >-
    Compost prediction considers emotional volatility, formatting hygiene, lineage discontinuity,
    and nutrient saturation.
  - >-
    Forecasting enables real-time health monitoring, merge readiness alerts, compost eligibility
    flags, and lineage rebraiding suggestions.
