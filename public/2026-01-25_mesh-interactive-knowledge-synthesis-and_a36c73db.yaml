title: 'MESH: Interactive Knowledge Synthesis and Relational Archiving'
summary: >-
  MESH is a novel system for creating and interacting with knowledge, synthesizing content into
  'proteins' (neurons) connected via 'synapses'. It moves beyond traditional archives by enabling
  physics-enabled 3D visualization and recursive AI querying within a dynamic, context-aware
  'resonance field'.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH synthesizes ingested documents into knowledge proteins (neurons) and connects them via
    synapses, visualized in a relational space.
  - >-
    Users can configure API keys (Gemini) or local LLMs for protein synthesis and access public or
    private proteins.
  - >-
    Conversation history is synthesized into new proteins, enabling infinite context memory through
    'composting' of older memories.
  - >-
    The system offers physics-enabled 3D interactive knowledge archives and a 'query organelle' for
    recursive AI exploration.
  - >-
    MESH is distinct from traditional archives, databases, or simple AI agents, focusing on emergent
    informational geometry and relational understanding.
