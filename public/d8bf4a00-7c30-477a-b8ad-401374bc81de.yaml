title: 'Desire Paths: Emergent Structure from Use and Attention'
summary: >-
  Desire paths are the informal, emergent routes created by user behavior, revealing truth and
  optimizing systems independent of planned design.  This concept applies across physical, digital,
  and conceptual spaces, highlighting the power of observing and formalizing what naturally arises
  from collective action and attention.
insights:
  - >-
    Desire paths, like worn footpaths, represent the actual, optimal routes chosen by users,
    contrasting with imposed or planned designs.
  - >-
    Truth is revealed through use: desire paths demonstrate collective intelligence and reality
    versus intention, showing what people *actually* do.
  - >-
    Effective design involves observing desire paths and then formalizing them, rather than imposing
    structures prematurely.
  - >-
    The concept of desire paths is substrate-independent, applying to physical movement, digital
    navigation, conceptual links, and social connections.
  - >-
    In knowledge architecture, formalizing structures (paving) should follow observation of emergent
    connections and high-traffic conceptual routes (desire paths).
  - >-
    The process of building knowledge or systems should prioritize capturing freely, linking
    naturally, observing emergence, and then formalizing clear paths.
