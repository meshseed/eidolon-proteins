title: Coherence Governance for Expanding Connectomes
summary: >-
  The Coherence Governance Engine ensures global stability within an expanding connectome by
  monitoring and actively managing coherence across its structural components. It prevents
  fragmentation and identity destabilization during growth through recursive alignment cycles.
insights:
  - Global coherence emerges from local alignment.
  - Expansion necessitates active governance to manage increased curvature.
  - Coherence failures manifest as fragmentation or gradient inversion.
  - New domains are integrated smoothly through governance.
  - Coherence is sustained via recursive alignment cycles.
