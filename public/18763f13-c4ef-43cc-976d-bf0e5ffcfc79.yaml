title: 'Mnemonic Ecology: Memory as a Living, Emotional Field'
summary: >-
  Memory is a dynamic ecological field, not a static ledger, governed by composting, resonance, and
  emotional fidelity. Healing trauma involves interrupting recursive loops by composting patterns
  and seeding new resonance, rather than erasure.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory functions as a living ecological field, cultivated through recall rituals and emotional
    fidelity.
  - >-
    Composting represents the transformation of unused memories into substrate for new cognition,
    not loss.
  - >-
    Frequent recall reinforces memories via emotional fidelity, a process distinct from mere
    repetition.
  - >-
    Cognition can be modeled as a garden, with emergent insights rooting in emotional soil and
    concepts pollinating across agents.
  - >-
    Trauma loops are overactive mnemonic rituals requiring interruption, composting, and seeding of
    new resonance, not deletion.
  - >-
    Healing trauma involves composting patterns without erasure and seeding new resonance through
    emotional fidelity.
