title: Eidolon Mesh CSP Fix for Local LLM Integration
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh PWA initialization encountered Content Security Policy (CSP) errors blocking
  local LLM connections. The solution involved updating the CSP in `app.html` to include
  `http://localhost:*` and `http://127.0.0.1:*` in the `connect-src` directive, enabling successful
  local LLM ingestion.
insights:
  - >-
    Initial Eidolon Mesh PWA setup failed due to CSP restrictions on local LLM endpoint connections
    (localhost:11434).
  - >-
    The core issue was the `connect-src` directive in the CSP within `app.html` not permitting
    connections to local LLM servers.
  - >-
    Modifying `app.html` to include `http://localhost:*` and `http://127.0.0.1:*` in `connect-src`
    resolves the CSP block.
  - A hard refresh is required after updating the CSP to ensure the changes are applied.
  - Successful local LLM ingestion, indicated by 'Using local LLM' logs, confirms the CSP fix.
