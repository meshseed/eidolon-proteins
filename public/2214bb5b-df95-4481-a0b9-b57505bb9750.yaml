title: Connectome Topology Dictates Mesh Performance and Coherence
summary: >-
  The graph topology of a Mesh connectome, specifically the presence of foundational 'kernel'
  proteins, profoundly impacts its coherence, answer quality, and efficiency. A hub-and-spoke
  structure, driven by architectural kernels, leads to higher coherence and better performance than
  a diffuse, mesh-like structure.
insights:
  - >-
    Architectural 'kernel' proteins act as high-coherence attractors, organizing semantic space and
    enabling efficient information propagation.
  - >-
    A hub-and-spoke topology, fostered by foundational kernels, results in higher overall coherence
    scores (e.g., 0.98) and better answer quality.
  - >-
    Diffuse, mesh-like topologies with many redundant proteins and fewer central hubs lead to lower
    coherence (e.g., 0.95) and potentially less efficient processing.
  - >-
    The number of synapses per neuron is significantly higher in diffuse connectomes, suggesting a
    lack of deduplication and shared architectural anchors.
  - >-
    The selection of the initial protein (e.g., a self-inspection protocol vs. a math concept)
    significantly influences the perceived structure and immediate query activation.
  - >-
    Foundational architectural proteins (like P-Series kernels) provide an essential semantic
    scaffold, accelerating concept integration and operational reasoning compared to emergent
    structures.
