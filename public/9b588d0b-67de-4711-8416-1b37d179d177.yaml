title: Graph Breathing Fix & Cloudflare Deployment Glitch
summary: >-
  A code change was implemented to fix a 'glitch' in graph visualization by replacing
  `.d3Alpha(0.3)` with `.resetCountdown()` for a smoother unfolding effect. A subsequent deployment
  attempt failed due to a Cloudflare internal error during dependency installation, likely a
  transient infrastructure issue.
insights:
  - >-
    The code fix involves reverting to `resetCountdown()` to restore a desired graph breathing
    animation.
  - >-
    The deployment failure on Cloudflare Pages occurred during `npm clean-install` and is attributed
    to a Cloudflare-side internal error.
  - >-
    The recommended solution for the deployment failure is to retry the deployment, as these errors
    are typically transient.
  - >-
    The original code likely attempted to use a non-existent or improperly configured alpha fading
    mechanism, which was corrected by defaulting to the standard countdown reset.
  - >-
    Dependency installation failures on platforms like Cloudflare Pages can stem from network
    issues, temporary server problems, or occasional build environment inconsistencies.
