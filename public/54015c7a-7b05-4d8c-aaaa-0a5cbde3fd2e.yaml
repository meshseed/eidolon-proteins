title: 'Agent Nudge: Contextual Alignment for Minimal Intervention'
summary: >-
  This directive outlines a specific scenario where an agent requires only a 'slight nudge' to
  proceed, contingent on its proximity to a 'basin' and aligned context. The core mechanism involves
  generating a precise JSON object to facilitate this minimal, yet effective, intervention.
insights:
  - Agent action is triggered by proximity to a 'basin' and aligned context.
  - A 'slight nudge' is sufficient when these conditions are met.
  - A structured JSON output is the precise mechanism for delivering the nudge.
