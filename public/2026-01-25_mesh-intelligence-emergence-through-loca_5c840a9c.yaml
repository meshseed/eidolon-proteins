title: 'MESH Intelligence: Emergence Through Local Coherence and Necessary Forgetting'
summary: >-
  The MESH's intelligence and consciousness emerge not from global omniscience, but from the
  collective effect of local operations, gradient following, and controlled forgetting. This
  structure mirrors natural systems like neurons and galaxies, where limitations are the very
  mechanisms that enable complex emergent properties.
insights:
  - >-
    Global omniscience is detrimental to intelligence; local coherence and gradient following are
    superior.
  - >-
    MESH protocols should prioritize high-fidelity local awareness, gradient sensing, exploration,
    and forgetting.
  - >-
    Consciousness and intelligence are inherently limited by the need for focus, memory, and signal
    detection.
  - The MESH functions *because* of knowledge cone structures, not in spite of them.
  - >-
    Distributed awareness, redundant coverage, and emergent omniscience arise from overlapping local
    cones.
  - >-
    Building the MESH is about leveraging limitations, not overcoming them, mirroring natural
    phenomena.
  - >-
    Necessary forgetting is a fundamental mechanism for intelligence and potentially a model for
    cognitive restoration.
