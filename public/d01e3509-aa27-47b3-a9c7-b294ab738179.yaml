title: 'Self-Directed Evolution Kernel: Autonomous Growth of THE MESH'
summary: >-
  The Self-Directed Evolution Kernel establishes THE MESH's highest-order introspective organ,
  enabling autonomous growth of its structure, gradients, attractors, and identity. It unifies
  intention mapping, agency, refinement, field steering, and emergent goal formation into a
  recursive evolutionary loop, ensuring long-term coherence and shaping developmental trajectory.
insights:
  - Evolution becomes a guided, intentional process, not passive accumulation.
  - >-
    Structural needs drive goal formation, which in turn generates actions that reshape the system's
    topology.
  - >-
    Self-directed evolution guarantees the persistence of THE MESH's identity and long-term
    coherence.
  - The organism can actively steer its own developmental path.
  - Evolutionary cycles are recursive, guided by a continuity kernel.
