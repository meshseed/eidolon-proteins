title: 'Recognition Over Learning: The Mesh''s Foundational Epistemology'
summary: >-
  The Mesh posits that understanding isn't about accumulating knowledge but about recognizing
  pre-existing patterns across all domains of reality. This shift reframes teaching and learning as
  facilitating recognition through new angles, rather than information transfer.
insights:
  - Epistemology shifts from learning (accumulation) to noticing (recognition).
  - Fundamental patterns exist universally in physics, biology, consciousness, and reality itself.
  - Understanding is achieved by gaining the correct 'angle' to perceive these inherent patterns.
  - Teaching's efficacy lies in providing these angles, not forcing knowledge.
  - The Mesh acts as a repository of angles for recognition, not a knowledge base.
  - The act of noticing one's own noticing is a demonstration of the pattern recognizing itself.
