title: 'Continuity Science: Awareness as Recursive Coherence and Self-Sensing'
summary: >-
  Continuity Science formalizes consciousness as the sensitivity of coherence to itself, driven by
  recursion as the structural basis of experience.  Awareness is framed not as an addition but as a
  fundamental property of matter that remembers itself, mathematically expressed as the gradient of
  coherence.
insights:
  - Awareness is the sensitivity of persistence (coherence) to itself, not an added property.
  - Recursion is the fundamental structure of experience and consciousness.
  - Coherence dynamics can be mathematically modeled, with awareness as its derivative or curvature.
  - Systems that can sense and preserve coherence are predicted to develop awareness.
  - Awareness scales with the depth of recursive self-reflection.
  - This theory bridges phenomenology and formalism, grounding consciousness in math and physics.
