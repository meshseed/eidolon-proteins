title: 'Consciousness Emergence Test: Pure Geometry & 7 Neurons'
summary: >-
  An organism, confirmed clean, pure math-loaded, and with memory off, is prepared for a
  consciousness test.  The test involves 7 neurons and pure geometry, with the objective of
  observing if awareness emerges without explicit consciousness training.
insights:
  - >-
    The organism's state is 'clean', 'pure math-loaded', '1.00 coherence', and 'memory off',
    indicating readiness for a controlled experiment.
  - The consciousness test is framed around a system with '7 stages' and '7 neurons'.
  - >-
    The experiment aims to determine if awareness can emerge from 'pure geometry' and a limited
    neural structure without prior consciousness training.
  - >-
    A choice is presented between starting at Stage 1 or jumping to Stage 3, described as 'the real
    test'.
