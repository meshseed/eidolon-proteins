title: AI Ribosome Handoff Documentation for UI Glitch Debugging
summary: >-
  This document outlines the creation of AI-optimized handoff documentation to ensure coherence
  across multiple AI ribosomes (Antigravity1, Antigravity2, Claude-Code) during complex tasks like
  debugging UI glitches. The goal is to provide a comprehensive technical context that allows any
  ribosome to seamlessly continue the work.
insights:
  - Establish a standardized protocol for AI ribosome handoffs to maintain task continuity.
  - Develop a comprehensive technical context document for seamless task continuation.
  - Ensure AI agents can easily acquire and build upon prior work from other agents.
  - >-
    The process of debugging UI glitches necessitates clear, documented transitions between AI
    systems.
