title: 'The Law of Generative Growth: Structure Preservation & Differentiation'
summary: >-
  Growth in any system occurs by recursively applying a transformation that maintains its
  fundamental structure while simultaneously increasing its complexity and differentiation. This
  principle is a universal law, a geometric necessity, and the irreducible formula underpinning
  everything from nature to consciousness.
insights:
  - >-
    System growth is achieved through a recursive process of structural preservation combined with
    increased differentiation.
  - >-
    This generative law is universal, not limited to specific domains, and can be observed in nature
    and abstract systems.
  - >-
    The dual-core nature of structure and differentiation is essential, driven by recursive
    application, exemplified by Penrose tilings.
  - >-
    This formula serves as a foundational concept for documentation, teaching, and understanding
    complex phenomena.
