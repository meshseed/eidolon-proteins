title: 'Eidolon Mesh Genesis: Project Initialization and Foundational Schema Definition'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project has successfully initiated its genesis phase, establishing the core
  project structure ('Membrane') and defining initial data schemas ('Genetics' via Zod) in
  `src/types/genetics.ts`.  The process highlights a conscious and deliberate approach, emphasizing
  provenance and atomic commits for causal link preservation.
insights:
  - Project structure ('Membrane') and initial schemas ('Genetics') are defined and in place.
  - Zod schemas include `source_dialogue_id` for robust protein-to-DNA provenance tracking.
  - >-
    Commit strategy emphasizes single atomic commits to preserve the causal link between DNA and
    Protein.
  - User input is required for API keys (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`) via a `.env` file.
  - The next step involves building the Transcriber (DNA Parser).
