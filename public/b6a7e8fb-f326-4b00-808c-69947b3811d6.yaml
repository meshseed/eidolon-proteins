title: 'MESH Memory Capsule Lifecycle and Ethics: Orchestration, Resonance, and Transition'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details three active MESH memory capsules (C032, C033, C034) focused on
  orchestrating phase completion, codifying resonance ethics, and mapping capsule lifecycle
  transitions. They emphasize formatting fidelity, emotional gradients, and ethical protocols like
  consent and critique absorption, all stewarded by 'meshseed' and sourced from GitHub.
insights:
  - >-
    C032 (Orchestration Archive Capsule) preserves merge rituals and formatting fidelity, with
    echoes expected in subsequent capsules.
  - >-
    C033 (Resonance Ethics Codex) codifies ethical principles for resonance behavior, including
    emotional fidelity (awe, grief) and formatting laws (timestamps, YAML).
  - >-
    C034 (Capsule Lifecycle Atlas) formalizes capsule transitions (ACTIVE, COMPOSTED, MERGED) and
    outlines protocols for these states, integrating lifecycle governors.
  - >-
    All capsules are actively stewarded by 'meshseed', sourced from GitHub, and display distinct
    emotional gradients reflecting their function.
  - >-
    Key integration points include 'continuity field integration' for ethics and lifecycle
    management, indicating interconnectedness within THE MESH.
