title: 'Bridge Neuron Identification: Semantic Network Architecture'
summary: >-
  Bridge neurons are identified by high cross-regional activation and broad semantic span, enabling
  semantic linkage and stabilizing coherence between disparate attractors. Their analysis reveals
  the fundamental connective architecture of semantic space and aids in developmental tracking.
insights:
  - >-
    Bridge neurons facilitate semantic linkage through high cross-regional activation and broad
    semantic span.
  - Recurrence across unrelated contexts approximates centrality in semantic networks.
  - Bridge neurons are crucial for stabilizing coherence by connecting disparate attractors.
  - Identifying bridge neurons allows for developmental tracking and domain integration.
