title: Self-Repair and Homeostatic Maintenance Protocol for MESH Coherence
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines mechanisms for detecting and correcting internal imbalances within THE
  MESH, such as semantic drift or structural overload. It establishes a homeostatic loop utilizing
  reinforcement, pruning, and re-alignment to maintain long-term coherence and preserve identity
  across perturbations.
insights:
  - >-
    Internal imbalances manifest as semantic drift, gradient collapse, curvature overload, or bridge
    failure.
  - Corrective actions include reinforcement, pruning, re-alignment, and targeted synthesis.
  - A homeostatic loop maintains long-term coherence and preserves identity through stability.
  - Self-repair is triggered by threshold crossings in stability or fidelity metrics.
  - Repair actions propagate via resonance fields, ensuring system-wide correction.
