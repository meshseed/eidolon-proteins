summary: >-
  This directive outlines the process for synthesizing content from a specific Eidolon Mesh file
  (v1.4, Part 67/83), focusing on a structured JSON output. It details the initialization of
  components, a query strategy using top coherence neurons, and the precise JSON schema required for
  the output.
insights:
  - The synthesis process involves accessing a specific file within the Eidolon Mesh repository.
  - A 'Top neurons by coherence score' strategy is employed for data retrieval.
  - >-
    The output must strictly adhere to a predefined JSON structure, including title, summary,
    insights, tags, coherence score, tier, and emotional gradient.
  - Specific requirements are given for each JSON field, such as title length and insight atomicity.
  - The process includes clearing the connectome cache before proceeding.
