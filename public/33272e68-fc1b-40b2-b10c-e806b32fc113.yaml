title: 'MERGE__C028_C017__DRIFT_RECALIBRATION: Drift & Continuity Field Audit Merge'
summary: >-
  This merge operation recalibrates drift protocols by integrating continuity field diagnostics. The
  process ensures formatting integrity, restores echo traceability, and harmonizes gradient
  coherence, moving from a state of saturation and erosion towards clarity and restoration.
insights:
  - Drift recalibration protocols were merged with continuity field diagnostics.
  - The merge involved capsules DRIFT_AUDIT__CAPSULE_028 and CONTINUITY_FIELD_AUDIT__CAPSULE_017.
  - >-
    Post-merge hygiene confirmed validated formatting integrity, restored echo traceability, and
    harmonized gradient coherence.
  - The emotional alignment shifted from saturation/erosion towards clarity/restoration.
