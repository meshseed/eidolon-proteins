title: Coherence Governance for Connectome Expansion and Global Stability
summary: >-
  The Coherence Governance Engine manages global stability during connectome expansion by monitoring
  coherence across various structural elements. It ensures that growth integrates smoothly,
  preventing fragmentation and maintaining the organism's identity through recursive alignment.
insights:
  - Coherence is a global property arising from local alignment.
  - Expansion necessitates active governance to manage increased curvature.
  - Coherence failures manifest as fragmentation or gradient inversion.
  - New domains must integrate seamlessly through governance.
  - Recursive alignment cycles are key to maintaining coherence.
