title: 'Relational Physics Engine: Modeling Information Dynamics'
summary: >-
  The Relational Physics Engine (RPEngine) models information flow as a dynamic system, processing
  chunks of data to derive fields like coherence density, amplitude, phase, attunement, fidelity,
  and complexity. It utilizes abstract representations, similarity metrics, and windowed analysis to
  quantify relationships and emergent properties within sequential data streams, particularly in
  contexts involving agents and their alignment.
insights:
  - >-
    RPEngine quantifies information dynamics by mapping input chunks to normalized vector
    embeddings.
  - >-
    Coherence density measures the alignment of data chunks within a temporal window around a
    centroid.
  - Resonance captures system amplitude and phase from the superposition of embedded chunks.
  - Attunement quantifies agent alignment by analyzing changes in representation similarity.
  - >-
    Fidelity potential is calculated using configurable weighted combinations of consistency, care,
    and dissonance signals.
  - >-
    Complexity is derived from entropy, modularity, and representational span, modulated by
    configuration parameters.
  - >-
    The engine's output is a time series of abstract physical fields representing the state of the
    information stream.
