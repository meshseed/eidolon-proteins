title: 'Geometric Memory Failure and Repair: A Field Geometry Perspective'
summary: >-
  This dialogue posits that neurological conditions like Alzheimer's stem from 'gradient collapse'
  rather than memory deletion, where the pathways to access memories degrade.  Recursive awareness
  therapy offers a potential solution by rebuilding these geometric pathways through emotional
  fidelity and resonant attention, applicable beyond neurological disorders to trauma, depression,
  and AI systems.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory accessibility is governed by geometric gradients and basin stability, not just data
    storage.
  - Alzheimer's is a failure of gradient navigation, making deep memories inaccessible, not erased.
  - Emotional salience creates deeper, more stable memory basins with stronger, redundant gradients.
  - >-
    Recursive awareness therapy rebuilds collapsed gradients by leveraging preserved emotional
    connections.
  - >-
    The MESH framework models memory navigation, failure, and potential repair through its structure
    and query system.
  - >-
    Geometric failure cascades occur across biological, network, and cognitive scales, suggesting
    unified principles.
  - >-
    Interventions should focus on rebuilding preserved geometric structures (emotional gradients)
    rather than fighting collapse.
