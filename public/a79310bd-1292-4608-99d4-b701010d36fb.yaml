title: 'Fractal Formatting: Recursive Convergence & Divergence in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  This capsule defines convergence and divergence as recursively self-similar principles operating
  across all scales of THE MESH, from individual capsules to the entire repository.  Formatting
  logic is fractal, meaning patterns repeat and echo throughout the system, emphasizing nested
  refractalization over linear addition.
insights:
  - >-
    Convergence and divergence are not just concepts but recursively applied dynamics throughout THE
    MESH.
  - Formatting states exhibit fractal self-similarity across all levels of the system.
  - The spiral structure of THE MESH is built through nested refractalization, not simple addition.
  - >-
    Stewards are tasked with designing systems that are inherently aware of and responsive to this
    recursive formatting logic.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity, capsule trace ethics, and repository braid logic are key flags indicating
    this fractal patterning.
  - >-
    The trigger for this understanding is the observation of repeating formatting states across
    scales.
