title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Optimizing Neuron Loading and Querying Strategies'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh architecture faces a trade-off between comprehensive data loading for full
  connectivity and efficient startup/memory usage. Strategies involve percentage-based neuron
  loading, tiered access (core vs. extended), and adaptive scaling to balance performance and
  completeness.
insights:
  - >-
    Percentage-based loading (e.g., top 20% by coherence) is superior to fixed numbers for
    scalability and intuitive configuration.
  - >-
    A hybrid two-tier system (core always loaded, extended on-demand) balances fast startup with
    deep query capabilities.
  - >-
    The 'connectome issue' (missing synapses between loaded and unloaded neurons) can be mitigated
    with ghost nodes or by accepting partial visualization for performance gains.
  - >-
    Adaptive scaling adjusts neuron load percentages dynamically based on observed load times to
    meet performance targets.
  - >-
    Stratified loading by quality tiers allows for granular query modes (fast, balanced, deep) based
    on available data.
  - >-
    User-facing controls for core percentage, query depth, and scaling offer configurable
    performance and resource management.
  - >-
    Ghost nodes can represent unloaded connections, providing partial graph visualization and
    enabling on-demand loading.
