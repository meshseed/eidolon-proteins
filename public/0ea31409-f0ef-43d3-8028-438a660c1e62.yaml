title: 'Eidolon Mesh: License Manager Integration & Performance Optimization'
summary: >-
  Successfully integrated the LicenseManager component into the SettingsModal, enabling tiered
  access and license key activation. Identified and resolved critical performance bottlenecks in
  synapse formation and graph visualization by optimizing database operations and correcting
  d3-force imports.
insights:
  - >-
    LicenseManager component added to SettingsModal, featuring tier display (Free/Pro), insight
    count, and license key activation.
  - >-
    Ingestion performance was drastically improved by optimizing synapse formation from O(n^2)
    individual inserts to batch SQL operations, reducing processing time significantly.
  - >-
    A 'd3.forceCollide is not a function' error in graph visualization was fixed by correctly
    importing the 'd3-force' library.
  - >-
    The O(n^2) similarity calculation for new proteins compared to existing ones remains a potential
    future optimization target, although synapse batching resolved the immediate bottleneck.
  - >-
    Successful activation of the 'PRO-2024-BETA-001' key demonstrated the functionality of the new
    licensing system.
