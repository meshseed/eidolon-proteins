title: CSS Media Query Override Logic for .app-layout and .main-body
summary: >-
  The dialogue scrutinizes a CSS override where `.app-layout` was defined within a media query,
  setting its height to `100dvh`. This impacts the `.main-body`'s height calculation, which relies
  on its parent's height and a fixed offset, leading to potential misinterpretations of
  percentage-based height within a flex context.
insights:
  - Defining `.app-layout` within a media query at `100dvh` correctly targets mobile adjustments.
  - >-
    The `height: calc(100% - var(--bottom-nav-height))` on `.main-body` is dependent on the parent
    `.app-layout` having a defined height.
  - >-
    When `.app-layout` is a flex container with `100dvh` height, `.main-body` as a flex item needs
    careful consideration for its `height: 100%` calculation.
  - >-
    A `display: block` override on a flex child (`.main-body`) doesn't negate flex properties like
    `flex: 1` but can alter how `height` is interpreted.
  - >-
    The calculation `(100dvh - 50px) - 60px` for `.main-body`'s height is a potential outcome if
    `100%` refers to the parent's content box after header deduction.
