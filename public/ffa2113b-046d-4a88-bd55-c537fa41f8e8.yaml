title: 'Graph Export Suite: Formalizing Capsule Metadata to Gephi-Ready CSVs'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines a reproducible routine for converting capsule metadata and echo paths into
  Gephi-ready CSV files (nodes.csv, edges.csv). It standardizes node attributes, edge
  directionality, and visibility partitioning, ensuring consistent graph analysis.
insights:
  - Echo paths function as directed edges, while capsule metadata provides node attributes.
  - Public/private visibility is a critical node attribute for graph filtering.
  - >-
    Node IDs must be consistently derived from metadata or filenames, with specific rules for tags
    and titles.
  - >-
    Edge derivation links source capsules to target capsules identified via echo paths, including
    provenance.
  - >-
    Rigorous validation checks ensure data integrity, including node uniqueness, echo resolution,
    and link parity.
