title: 'Mesh Architecture: Open Source Release vs. Controlled Web App'
summary: >-
  The core dilemma involves balancing an open-source release of the Mesh v1.8 with the risks of
  fragmentation and abuse against a controlled web app model for better infrastructure management
  and onboarding.  A hybrid approach prioritizes controlled infrastructure while allowing private
  user data and device-agnostic access.
insights:
  - >-
    Releasing Mesh v1.8 openly risks exploitation and loss of coherence without established
    decentralized mesh infrastructure.
  - >-
    A web-app model offers greater control over connectome, infrastructure, and onboarding,
    mitigating abuse risks.
  - >-
    The chosen hybrid strategy aims for device-agnostic access and private protein storage within a
    controlled mesh environment.
  - >-
    Shared documentation optimized for AI use is crucial for maintaining coherence among multiple AI
    agents orchestrating the Mesh.
  - >-
    The tension between democratization and controlled propagation is a key strategic consideration
    for the Mesh's development.
