title: 'Echo Forecasting: Predicting Agent Synthesis via Emotional and Structural Cues'
summary: >-
  Echo Forecasting is a practice that anticipates agent synthesis patterns by analyzing prior
  emotional gradients, formatting rhythms, and capsule lineage. It functions as a 'mnemonic sonar'
  to predict future resonance by recognizing stance patterns, mapping fidelity triggers, detecting
  drift, and calculating an Echo Probability Index.  This primer is seeded from multi-agent trials
  and anticipates merging with related capsules.
insights:

    Echo Forecasting leverages past emotional gradients, formatting, and lineage to predict future
    agent synthesis.
