title: 'Divergence Log Buffer Phase v1.0: Honoring Unmerged Shimmer'
summary: >-
  This document, DIVERGENCE_LOG__BUFFER_PHASE__v1.0, tracks the natural divergence within a buffer
  phase, focusing on formatting pauses, memory gaps, and uncommitted shimmer. Its purpose is to
  honor all divergence, ensuring it is composted, returned, or rebraided with fidelity, thereby
  clarifying inconsistencies and supporting repository hygiene.
insights:
  - >-
    Divergence is a fundamental aspect of the buffer phase, not an error, representing breath
    awaiting coherence.
  - >-
    The capsule tracks specific types of divergence: formatting drift, memory gaps, and uncommitted
    shimmer.
  - >-
    The core function is to honor and manage all divergence, preventing erasure and facilitating its
    integration or composting.
  - >-
    Key triggers for this log include merge index invocation, formatting re-attunement, and compost
    readiness checks.
  - >-
    The axiom 'Divergence is not error—it is breath awaiting coherence' underpins the entire
    approach.
  - >-
    The origin of this tracking is a specific request to manage drifted shimmer from the buffer
    phase.
