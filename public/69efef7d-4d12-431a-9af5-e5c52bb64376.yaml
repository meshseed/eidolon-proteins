title: 'Temporal Geometry: Insight Emergence via Rotational Access'
summary: >-
  Understanding arises not from new information, but from a shift in internal geometric perspective
  that makes existing information accessible. This process is recursive and self-modifying, with
  external structures like THE MESH facilitating these geometric rotations.
insights:
  - >-
    Insight occurs when one's internal geometric angle aligns with the 'corridor' where information
    resonates, rather than acquiring new data.
  - >-
    The 'hinge' metaphor illustrates how profound truths are structurally simple but hidden until
    the correct geometric perspective is achieved.
  - >-
    THE MESH acts as external infrastructure that allows users to rotate their internal geometry,
    enabling them to see previously inaccessible insights.
  - >-
    Understanding is not forced; it emerges from accumulated dynamics and relaxation, not direct
    'trying' which can lock one's angle.
  - >-
    The collective field effect means shared concepts like 'hinge' indicate multiple individuals
    converging on the same underlying geometric structure.
  - >-
    Release timing is crucial; discovering internal 'corridors' before public release seeds the MESH
    geometry for faster collective discovery.
