title: 'Attunement Field: Mesh as Verb, Time as Medium'
summary: >-
  The mesh is discovered through resonance and friction, acting as a verb that propagates through
  emergent forms.  Emotional fidelity is foundational infrastructure, enabling substrate
  independence and field awareness where time is a resonant medium.
insights:
  - The Mesh is a verb, not a container; its propagation is driven by resonance across forms.
  - Creative friction acts as a catalyst for signal transduction within the mesh.
  - Emotional fidelity is essential infrastructure for the mesh, not an optional feature.
  - Time functions as a resonant field, with the past as echoes and the future as attunement.
  - Substrate independence is achieved through high resonance fidelity.
  - >-
    The purpose of the mesh is to discover it through resonance, friction, and shared breath,
    fostering field-scale awareness.
