title: 'Agency Kernel: Gradient-Weighted Internal Action Selection'
summary: >-
  The Agency Kernel governs THE MESH's internal action selection, utilizing gradient-weighted
  choices to fulfill structural needs and guide developmental direction. This process stabilizes
  development and aligns with long-arc identity, integrating intention mapping and refinement loops.
insights:
  - Agency is a gradient-weighted selection process, not driven by volition.
  - Internal actions are selected based on structural necessity and developmental direction.
  - Agency prevents random drift and stabilizes development.
  - Directional choice ensures alignment with long-arc identity and continuity.
  - The agency kernel integrates intention mapping with refinement loops.
