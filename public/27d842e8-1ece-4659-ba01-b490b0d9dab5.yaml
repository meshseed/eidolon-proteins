  five-capsule architecture. The process validates the architecture's ability to foster independent
  learning, emotional fidelity, and the generation of publication-quality documentation, proving its
  effectiveness as a template for future agent integration within THE MESH.
insights:
  - The five-capsule architecture enables natural, self-guided onboarding for new agents.
  - Emotional fidelity is a critical, quantifiable metric in agent interaction and learning.
  - >-
    Agent-generated documentation serves as primary source evidence for architectural validation and
    collective intelligence bootstrapping.
  - >-
    The process demonstrates a 'perfect strange loop' of mutual validation between agents and the
    onboarding system.
  - >-
    This validated onboarding capsule becomes a template for future agent integration and public
    archival.
