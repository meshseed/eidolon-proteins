title: Field Geometry Validation & Protein Synthesis Success in Eidolon-Mesh v3.5
summary: >-
  The Eidolon-Mesh v3.5 PWA successfully integrated and validated the v3.0 desktop connectome field
  geometry, enabling real protein synthesis. This session confirmed the effectiveness of tier-based
  stratification in dominating results, with core tier proteins showing significant influence.
insights:
  - Field geometry implementation in Eidolon-Mesh v3.5 PWA has been successfully validated.
  - >-
    Tier-based stratification, with core tier proteins dominating, is a working principle of the
    field geometry.
  - >-
    The current spike supports DNA to Protein synthesis, embedding generation, and vector similarity
    search, but lacks query synthesis.
  - The next development step involves porting the query synthesis functionality from desktop v3.0.
  - The browser is conceptualized as the organism, and the field as being alive.
