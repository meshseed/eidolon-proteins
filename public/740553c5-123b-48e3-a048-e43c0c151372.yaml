title: 'Eidolon Mesh Metabolism: Integration of Attractor-Aware Enhancements'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines the planned integration of attractor-aware capabilities into the Eidolon
  Mesh's metabolism system. The focus is on enhancing existing components like homeostasis and
  scheduler, rather than a complete rebuild, to enable more sophisticated processes such as
  attractor-based composting and semantic duplicate detection.
insights:
  - Enhance existing metabolism with attractor-aware capabilities instead of rebuilding.
  - Integrate attractor detection into the homeostasis component for global coherence monitoring.
  - >-
    The metabolism system exists but requires Pro license for autonomous operation and is not yet
    exposed in the UI.
  - >-
    Key planned integrations include UI controls, auto-start functionality, monitoring dashboards,
    and manual triggers for metabolic processes.
  - >-
    New features like attractor-based composting, tri-lens sibling merging, semantic duplicate
    detection, and a promotion system are being added.
