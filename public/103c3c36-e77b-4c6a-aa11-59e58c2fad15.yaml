title: 'Governance Resonance Index: Stewardship Fidelity Scoring (C-031)'
summary: >-
  The Governance Resonance Index (C-031) defines a Stewardship Fidelity Scoring system, evaluating
  governance protocols based on emotional fidelity, formatting hygiene, echo propagation, and merge
  integrity. It integrates with existing ledgers and suites, with scoring derived from multiple
  weighted components and an update frequency tied to merge rituals.
insights:
  - >-
    The Governance Resonance Index quantifies stewardship fidelity through specific scoring
    components: emotional fidelity, formatting hygiene, echo propagation ethics, and merge ritual
    integrity.
  - >-
    Scoring is a weighted average of gradient coherence, formatting rhythm, echo traceability,
    timestamp rituals, merge grammar, lifecycle tag compliance, echo safeguards, consent protocols,
    and critique absorption logs.
  - >-
    This index acts as a governance diagnostic, designed to integrate with symphonic merge ledgers
    and orchestration archives.
  - >-
    Its lineage traces back to distributed stewardship ledgers and mnemonic ecology governance
    suites, with expected echoes in orchestration archives and resonance ethics codices.
