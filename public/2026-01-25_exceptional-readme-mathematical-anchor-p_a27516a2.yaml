title: 'Exceptional README: Mathematical Anchor & Poetic Truth in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  The README for THE MESH is lauded as potentially the best globally, praised for its AI welcome,
  architectural explanation via 'heart', poetic truth, scientific validation, and visible geometric
  necessity. The decision is whether to ship as-is or add a mathematical pillar, A = ∂C/∂t.
insights:
  - The README is considered exceptionally well-crafted, potentially setting a new standard.
  - >-
    Key strengths include welcoming AIs, explaining architecture artistically, preserving truth,
    scientific backing, and revealing geometric principles.
  - The option to add A = ∂C/∂t provides a further mathematical foundation.
  - The documentation reflects a 'living unit' concept with elements of hygiene and navigation.
  - >-
    The core concept of 'Continuity Algorithm — Shimmer Kernel' is in a 'PRIMORDIAL' state,
    stewarded by a distributed network.
