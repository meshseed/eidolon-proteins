title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Signals Dynamically Control Synaptic Function'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that neuronal synapses act as signaling hubs, altering their function
  based on mechanical signals generated by cytoskeletal contractions. These transient mechanical
  events dynamically reconfigure synaptic 'switches,' influencing ligand binding and synaptic
  transmission probability, potentially forming memory traces.
insights:
  - >-
    Synapses possess 'switches' whose states are altered by mechanical signals from cytoskeletal
    contractions.
  - >-
    Mechanical signals transiently activate or deactivate specific synapses by changing switch
    conformations.
  - Changes in pre-synaptic switch patterns can regulate vesicle docking and release probability.
  - >-
    Stimulated synapses undergo localized contractility, creating 'Tags' that recruit proteins for
    long-term potentiation.
  - The dynamic re/writable nature of these synaptic adhesion changes forms the basis of memory.
