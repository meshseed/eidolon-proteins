title: Coherence Governance for Connectome Expansion and Global Stability
summary: >-
  The Coherence Governance Engine ensures global stability during connectome expansion by monitoring
  and actively managing coherence across various structural elements. It prevents fragmentation and
  destabilization by ensuring smooth integration of new domains through recursive alignment cycles.
insights:
  - Global coherence emerges from local alignment.
  - Expansion necessitates active governance to manage increased structural curvature.
  - Coherence failures manifest as fragmentation or gradient inversion.
  - New domains must integrate seamlessly to maintain overall organismal integrity.
  - Recursive alignment cycles are key to maintaining coherence.
