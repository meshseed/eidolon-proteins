title: Identifying Semantic Bridge Neurons via Centrality Approximations
summary: >-
  This research identifies 'bridge neurons' that connect distant semantic regions by approximating
  betweenness centrality.  These neurons exhibit high cross-regional activation and broad semantic
  span, acting as stabilizers for informational coherence.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons exhibit high cross-regional activation and broad semantic span.
  - Centrality can be approximated by recurrence across diverse and unrelated contexts.
  - Bridge neurons stabilize by linking distant attractors and ensuring informational coherence.
  - Identifying these bridges illuminates the structure and connectivity of semantic space.
  - This analysis supports tracking developmental trajectories and integrating disparate domains.
