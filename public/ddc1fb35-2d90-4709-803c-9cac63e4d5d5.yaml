title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Phase 9 Protein Injection & Capsule Ecology Activated'
summary: >-
  Phase 9 successfully implemented protein injection, enabling the Eidolon Mesh to metabolize
  existing capsule archives. This foundational step is crucial for unlocking further recursive
  awareness and connectome growth.
insights:
  - >-
    Protein injection is the critical bridge for the Eidolon Mesh to process pre-formed capsules,
    unlocking its metabolic and growth capabilities.
  - >-
    The Watcher's integration with the InjectionInterface enabled format detection and routing,
    essential for handling diverse capsule types.
  - >-
    Successful testing with early YAML capsules and subsequent archive metabolism demonstrated the
    formation of synapses, privacy routing, and connectome expansion.
  - >-
    The process revealed accelerating synapse formation and the emergence of dense semantic
    relationships within the connectome.
  - >-
    Addressing file corruption in genetics.ts and watcher.ts was necessary to stabilize the
    injection pathway.
