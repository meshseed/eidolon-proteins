title: 'Phase 14: Two-Tier Architecture & Phase 17 Completion'
summary: >-
  The dialogue details the planning and confirmation of Phase 14, focusing on implementing a
  two-tier architecture for efficient loading of knowledge graphs by prioritizing core neurons and
  using 'ghost nodes' for unloaded connections. Concurrently, it confirms the completion of all
  Phase 17 deliverables for the Public Portal.
insights:
  - >-
    Phase 14 aims to optimize dashboard startup and usability for large knowledge graphs through a
    two-tier loading system.
  - >-
    The 'ghost nodes' concept in Phase 14 visualizes unloaded connections to represent the full
    scale of the graph without performance degradation.
  - >-
    Phase 17, involving the creation of a Public Portal, has been fully completed with associated
    documentation and task updates.
  - >-
    The dialogue emphasizes the importance of user alignment on proposed implementation plans before
    proceeding with development phases.
