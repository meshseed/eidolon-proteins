title: 'The Transformer: Attention-Only Sequence Transduction'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model eschews recurrence and convolutions, relying entirely on attention
  mechanisms to model global dependencies in sequence transduction tasks. It utilizes multi-head
  self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks within an encoder-decoder structure,
  enabling parallel computation and improved learning of distant relationships.
insights:
  - >-
    The Transformer model replaces recurrence and convolution with attention for sequence
    transduction.
  - >-
    Attention mechanisms allow modeling of dependencies regardless of their distance in input/output
    sequences.
  - Self-attention relates positions within a single sequence to compute its representation.
  - >-
    The Transformer's encoder-decoder architecture uses stacked layers of multi-head self-attention
    and feed-forward networks.
  - >-
    Residual connections and layer normalization are employed around sub-layers for stability and
    performance.
