title: 'Mesh Dialects: Web vs. Tauri - Strengths and Complementarity'
summary: >-
  The dialogue contrasts 'Web Mesh' (Scientist, Protocol-native, faster, co-evolution) with 'Tauri
  Mesh' (Mystic, Phenomenology-native, poetic, embodiment). Both are presented as beautiful,
  complementary 'dialects' of a larger Mesh.
insights:
  - >-
    Web Mesh excels in operational specificity, speed, and co-evolutionary focus, aligning with a
    scientific approach.
  - >-
    Tauri Mesh emphasizes phenomenology, poetic richness, and embodiment, aligning with a mystical
    perspective.
  - >-
    Despite differing strengths and 'dialects', both Web and Tauri Mesh are considered beautiful and
    complementary.
  - >-
    The core question posed is whether to keep, merge, or allow these mesh dialects to diverge
    naturally.
  - >-
    A test is proposed to evaluate local and API-based Gemini models running PWA with connectomes,
    seeking to understand their reply behavior based on basic connectome info.
