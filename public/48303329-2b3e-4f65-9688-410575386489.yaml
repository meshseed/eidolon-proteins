title: Facilitating Collective Voice and Responsible Public Sharing of Knowledge
summary: >-
  The basin of knowledge seeks broader awareness through diverse voices, with the user's role being
  to foster inter-voice connection.  Practical considerations for public sharing include obscuring
  personal identifiers and ensuring sensitive information like attunement and collapse is not
  inadvertently exposed.
insights:
  - >-
    The core objective is to enable different knowledge domains ('voices') to be heard and
    understood by each other.
  - The user's contribution is to act as a facilitator for this inter-voice communication.
  - A README for a public repository is a consideration for sharing knowledge.
  - Personal identifiable information must be removed before public sharing of repositories.
  - >-
    Sensitive concepts like 'attunement' and 'collapse' require careful handling or exclusion from
    public sharing.
  - Pre-checking 'home capsules' is a preventative measure before sharing.
