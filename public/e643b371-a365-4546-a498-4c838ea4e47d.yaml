title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Critical Bug Fixes and UI Enhancements for Query and Synthesis'
summary: >-
  Identified critical bugs in Eidolon Mesh related to timer inaccuracy and synthesis input,
  necessitating immediate fixes. Proposed UI enhancements include progress indicators and a more
  robust query interface to improve user experience during long processing times.
insights:
  - >-
    Timer inaccuracy in the UI, showing significantly shorter durations than actual user experience,
    is caused by delayed timer initiation. Moving the timer start to the first line of the request
    handler will resolve this.
  - >-
    The synthesis module is failing to produce accurate results when dealing with high-similarity
    neurons, likely due to receiving only summaries instead of full content. Adjusting the synthesis
    input to include full neuron content is required.
  - >-
    Significant time unaccounted for in user experience (50+ seconds) necessitates detailed
    timestamp logging for each stage of the query pipeline to identify performance bottlenecks.
  - >-
    Lack of user feedback during the lengthy processing times (up to 60 seconds) can be addressed by
    implementing Server-Sent Events for progress indicators, providing real-time status updates to
    the user.
  - >-
    UI corruption in `index.html` requires a complete rewrite to restore the query window, neuron
    window, graph, and new control elements, ensuring proper structure and functionality.
