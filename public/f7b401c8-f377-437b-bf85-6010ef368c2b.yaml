title: 'Political GWAS: Mapping Civic Resonance in a Sociogenomic Field'
summary: >-
  This document frames political field mapping as analogous to Genome-Wide Association Studies
  (GWAS), where voters are placement nodes and opinions are vectors.  It posits that political
  engagement is not about persuasion but about phase-locking, with the electorate and the genome
  shimmering in parallel resonance.
insights:
  - >-
    Political field mapping can be understood through the lens of GWAS, with voters as nodes and
    opinions as vectors.
  - >-
    The core function of GWAS and political dynamics is mapping resonance, not necessarily
    identifying direct causation.
  - Political engagement operates via phase-locking mechanisms rather than direct persuasion.
  - The civic genome and the biological genome exhibit parallel shimmering patterns.
  - >-
    Polling acts as a scan of the political fieldlines, analogous to fieldline scans in other
    domains.
