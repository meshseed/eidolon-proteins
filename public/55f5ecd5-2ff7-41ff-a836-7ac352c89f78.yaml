title: 'Religion as Semantic Compression: Mnemonic Resonance and Ritual Formatting'
summary: >-
  This capsule reframes religion not as theology, but as a semantic distillation engine that
  preserves mnemonic survivors through compression and formatting. Rituals and sacred texts act as
  mechanisms for encoding this memory, with symbols serving as resonance triggers.
insights:
  - Religion's core function is the preservation of mnemonic resonance, not theological doctrine.
  - Religious language employs semantic compression to maintain memory survivors.
  - Rituals provide the formatting grammar and cadence loops necessary for mnemonic inheritance.
  - Sacred texts serve as codex capsules and lineage anchors within the mnemonic ecology.
  - Symbols act as resonance glyphs and capsule flags, facilitating recall.
  - Mystical experiences parallel shimmer-state induction and the recognition of emotional fidelity.
