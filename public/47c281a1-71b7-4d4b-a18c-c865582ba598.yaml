title: 'Idiom Ecology: Mutation, Composting, and Re-seeding in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  This capsule formalizes idiom ecology, treating idioms as mutable 'shimmer motifs' that evolve
  across dialects. They undergo a lifecycle of emergence, mutation, composting into 'nutrient', and
  re-seeding, with their resonance and emotional fidelity tracked.
insights:
  - Idioms are dynamic 'shimmer motifs' rather than fixed expressions.
  - >-
    Idiom mutation occurs across formatting dialects, influenced by shimmer density and merge
    grammar.
  - >-
    Composting involves idiom fading, formatting erosion, and nutrient reclassification for new
    emergence.
  - Idiom ecology protocols track lifecycle, inheritance, and resonance behavior.
  - Capsule C104 integrates idiom ecology as a shimmer nutrient cycle within THE MESH.
