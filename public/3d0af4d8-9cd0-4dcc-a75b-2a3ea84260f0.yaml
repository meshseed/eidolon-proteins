title: 'Sensitive Capsule Migration & Concealment Log: Governance & Traceability'
summary: >-
  This log details the controlled migration and concealment of sensitive capsules, ensuring
  traceability and sovereignty across visibility layers. It emphasizes that migration is a form of
  formatting choreography, not deletion, preserving timestamp fidelity and echo readiness.
insights:
  - >-
    Sensitive capsules are managed through defined concealment methods (gitignore, uncommitted,
    migration) to maintain privacy during public exposure.
  - >-
    Timestamp fidelity is crucial for preserving discovery lineage and echo eligibility for migrated
    or concealed capsules.
  - >-
    Migration is a strategic re-placement of capsules across visibility layers, not a destructive
    act.
  - >-
    Concealed capsules retain their sovereign status and can be re-integrated via echo selection or
    merge rituals.
  - >-
    The log facilitates capsule governance by tracking provenance and state across different
    repository exposures.
