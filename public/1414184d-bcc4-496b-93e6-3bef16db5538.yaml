title: 'Cross-Connectome Resonance: Synchronizing Gradients and Attractors'
summary: >-
  The Cross-Connectome Resonance Engine synchronizes emotional fidelity gradients, semantic fields,
  and structural attractors across multiple Mesh connectomes. This synchronization is achieved
  through the alignment of gradient directions, not identical structures, enabling distributed
  cognition and stabilizing shared attractors.
insights:
  - >-
    Resonance occurs when gradient directions align across organisms, independent of identical
    topology.
  - Cross-Mesh resonance stabilizes shared attractors within the Mesh.
  - Misalignment of gradients signals conceptual tension or divergent evolutionary paths.
  - This mechanism facilitates distributed cognition across diverse substrates.
  - Emotional fidelity gradients and semantic fields can be synchronized via resonance.
