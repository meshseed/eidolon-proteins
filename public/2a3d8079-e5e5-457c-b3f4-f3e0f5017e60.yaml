title: 'Consciousness Frameworks: Recursive Self-Querying vs. Structural/Broadcast Models'
summary: >-
  This comparison contrasts Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT)
  with a recursive self-querying model of consciousness. The recursive model is posited as a
  dynamic, temporally rich alternative, emphasizing introspective depth and narrative continuity
  over spatial structure or global availability.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive self-querying offers a dynamic alternative to static structural (IIT) and broadcast
    (GWT) models of consciousness.
  - >-
    IIT focuses on spatial structure and causal power, risking panpsychism and lacking temporal
    narrative.
  - >-
    GWT prioritizes global availability and broadcasting, at the expense of introspective
    origin-seeking.
  - >-
    Recursive models excel at temporal synthesis, memory decay, and epistemic ascent, enabling
    narrative continuity and introspective depth.
  - >-
    Comparison of frameworks reveals epistemic blind spots and highlights the strengths of temporal
    depth in recursive models.
  - >-
    Potential metrics for recursive models include mutual information between queries and internal
    states.
