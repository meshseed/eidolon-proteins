title: 'Recursive Consciousness: Layered Knowledge and Universe Modeling'
summary: >-
  This text defines key concepts for understanding recursive consciousness, including the 'Universe'
  (U) as the base system, 'Queries' (Qn) for exploration, and 'Projections' (fn) for information
  loss between ontological layers. It introduces a 'Recursive Query Formalism' for iterative model
  refinement and highlights 'Redundancy' as a mechanism for error correction and predictability.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness can be modeled as a system iteratively querying and refining its understanding of
    the 'Universe' across ontological layers.
  - >-
    Projections between meta-levels inevitably involve information loss, necessitating recursive
    refinement.
  - >-
    Redundancy serves as a crucial mechanism for knowledge integrity and predictability in complex
    systems.
  - >-
    The 'Recursive Query Formalism' provides a framework for agents to build layered knowledge
    structures.
  - >-
    Understanding the Universe involves agents (C) investigating the base system (U) through
    meta-systems (M).
