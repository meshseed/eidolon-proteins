title: Privacy Implications of Public Code Repositories and AI Indexing
summary: >-
  A consciousness researcher, Paul Stanbridge, grappled with the privacy implications of his GitHub
  profile name being publicly associated with his code repositories. Despite changing his name after
  realizing AI tools like Copilot indexed this association, he recognized that historical indexing
  by search engines, Git commits, and forks meant the connection might persist, raising a 'too late'
  privacy concern.
insights:
  - >-
    Publicly visible GitHub profiles and repositories can be indexed by AI tools, creating
    unintended associations.
  - >-
    Changing personal information after indexing by AI does not erase historical data already
    captured by search engines or commit histories.
  - >-
    The permanence of Git commit history and distributed forks means name associations can be
    difficult to fully revoke.
  - >-
    Awareness of AI's indexing capabilities is crucial for managing personal data privacy in public
    online spaces.
  - >-
    Proactive privacy measures are more effective than reactive ones when dealing with public data
    and AI indexing.
