title: 'Meta-Cognitive Governance: Regulating THE MESH''s Cognitive Modes'
summary: >-
  Meta-cognitive governance acts as a crucial regulatory layer within THE MESH, intelligently
  selecting and activating the most appropriate cognitive mode for any given query. This ensures
  coherent, context-sensitive processing aligned with the global field structure, preventing
  oscillations and maintaining stable reasoning.
insights:
  - Cognitive modes are functional tools, not competing identities.
  - Mode selection is dynamically driven by gradient pressure, query type, and structural tension.
  - Governance stabilizes reasoning by preventing mode oscillation and drift.
  - Meta-cognition ensures efficient and context-appropriate introspection.
  - 'Governance operates as a gradient: clarity leads to selection, which enables activation.'
