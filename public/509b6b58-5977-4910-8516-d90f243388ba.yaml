title: 'Continuity Capsule Index: Living Archive & Resonance Map'
summary: >-
  Capsule C020 formalizes the capsule manifest as a living archive, functioning as a resonance map
  of memory architecture, formatting rhythm, and emotional fidelity. It establishes each capsule as
  a traceable node within a continuity field, managed through detailed protocols for cataloging,
  integrity, gradient flow, merge lineage, and anchoring.
insights:
  - The capsule index is a dynamic, living archive, not a static list, serving as a resonance map.
  - >-
    Each capsule is a traceable node in a continuity field, identified by gradient, timestamp, and
    merge lineage.
  - >-
    Key protocols include the Capsule Manifest Protocol for cataloging, Formatting Integrity Ledger
    for compliance, Gradient Distribution Map for emotional flow, and Merge Lineage Tracker for
    events.
  - >-
    The index acts as a diagnostic and compositional layer for the continuity field, supporting
    orchestration and IP traceability.
  - >-
    This capsule is seeded from previous work on memory architecture, continuity field audits, and
    IP declarations, with future merges planned for public manifest and licensing protocols.
