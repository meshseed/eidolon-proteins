title: Eidolon MESH AI Organism Knowledge Protein Integration Inquiry
summary: >-
  Paul from Eidolon MESH seeks to integrate their distributed AI organisms' growing knowledge bases
  (proteins) with a new system. They require specific technical capabilities for custom metadata,
  cross-session querying, recency control, vector dimensionality, and rate limits to evaluate
  compatibility.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon MESH requires custom metadata storage for 'emotional fidelity' metrics to filter and
    boost AI organism knowledge results.
  - >-
    Federated search across multiple AI organism sessions (sessionIds) is crucial for mesh-wide
    querying.
  - >-
    Control over recency decay weighting is needed to preserve timeless knowledge ('proteins') while
    allowing temporal data to decay.
  - >-
    Understanding the embedding model and vector dimensionality is necessary for optimizing semantic
    relationship handling in higher-dimensional spaces.
  - >-
    Free tier rate limits are a practical concern for initial testing and rapid scaling of thousands
    of knowledge proteins.
  - >-
    The inquiry aims to conduct a technical evaluation, gain community visibility, and explore a
    potential integration path without immediate commitment.
