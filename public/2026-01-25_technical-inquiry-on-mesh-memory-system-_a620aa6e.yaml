title: Technical Inquiry on Mesh Memory System Capabilities
summary: >-
  A user is evaluating a mesh memory system, posing specific technical questions regarding custom
  metadata, multi-session queries, recency control, embedding model details, and free tier limits.
  The user acknowledges the hybrid search approach as a valuable feature.
insights:
  - >-
    The system needs to support custom metadata for flexible filtering and boosting of memory search
    results.
  - Cross-session querying is essential for comprehensive data retrieval.
  - Users require control over the recency decay coefficient to manage memory persistence.
  - >-
    Information on the embedding model and vector dimensionality is needed to assess semantic search
    quality.
  - Free tier rate limits for storage and retrieval are critical for planning usage.
  - The hybrid BM25 + vector search approach is a significant advantage for RAG applications.
