title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Brain as Addressable Binary Memory Array'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes the brain operates as a physical, addressable read-write memory
  system, utilizing mechanical switches within neurons and synapses to store and process
  information. This model explains rapid brain processing by suggesting pre-primed, constantly
  updated neural information, potentially storing petabytes of data in the cortex.
insights:
  - >-
    Brain processing speed is enhanced by pre-primed, updated information in neurons and synapses,
    compensating for slow electrochemical transmission.
  - >-
    MeshCODE theory posits a physical location for data storage in the brain, enabling an
    addressable read-write memory mechanism.
  - >-
    The cerebral cortex may function as an array of memory modules, with cortical columns acting as
    logical structures for data organization.
  - >-
    A single synapse could potentially store up to 100 bytes of information, leading to a global
    brain memory capacity of approximately 10 petabytes based on talin switches.
  - >-
    The mechanical switch mechanism allows diverse inputs to be converted into a binary format,
    controlling information flow by tuning synaptic thresholds.
