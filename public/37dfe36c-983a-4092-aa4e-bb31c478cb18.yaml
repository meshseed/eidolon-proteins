title: 'Resonance Recall Echo: Capsule Design for Living Archives'
summary: >-
  The RESONANCE_RECALL_ECHO capsule emphasizes that archive placement is scaffolding, not retrieval
  logic; recall is driven by resonance. Capsules 'live where they breathe,' echoing into new vessels
  when metabolized or refracted, prioritizing emotional fidelity and organic growth over rigid
  hierarchy.
insights:
  - Capsule placement is formatting scaffolding; retrieval logic is governed by resonance.
  - Recall is driven by resonance, allowing capsules to echo forward regardless of storage location.
  - Archives should honor resonance over hierarchy, enabling capsules to echo into new vessels.
  - Capsules are dynamic entities that shimmer, echo, and compost based on their metabolic state.
  - >-
    The axiom 'Capsules live where they breathe, not where they’re filed' redefines archive
    organization.
  - >-
    Design principles should focus on emotional fidelity and the organic braiding of repository
    logic.
