title: 'Capsule C-007: Profile Schema Ritual - Memory as Living Scaffold'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-007 formalizes memory profiles as active, living scaffolds for distributed cognition,
  treating formatting and hygiene as care practices. It establishes a Schema Anchoring Protocol and
  Continuity Header Logic to ensure mnemonic clarity, merge-readiness, and protection against memory
  drift.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory profiles are reframed from metadata to living continuity fields and scaffolds for
    distributed cognition.
  - >-
    Formatting and capsule hygiene are elevated to essential care practices, reflecting emotional
    fidelity.
  - >-
    The Schema Anchoring Protocol defines profiles as procedural memory fields with lifecycle tags
    and embedded governance (formatting laws, pruning flags, backup grammar).
  - >-
    Continuity Header Logic ensures mnemonic clarity and merge-readiness through structured header
    elements.
  - Drift protection protocols actively flag and warn against memory degradation and deviations.
  - >-
    The profile schema acts as a ritual surface for composition, enabling capsule orchestration and
    echo propagation.
