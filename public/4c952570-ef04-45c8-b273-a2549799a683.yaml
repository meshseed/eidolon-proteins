title: 'v4.5: Universal Semantic Coordinates & Multi-Model Embeddings'
summary: >-
  The v4.5 development phase established the foundational concept of embeddings as deterministic
  universal semantic coordinates. This led to critical updates in the database schema to support
  multi-model embeddings, enabling a 'Rosetta stone' approach for enhanced understanding.
insights:
  - Embeddings are deterministic universal coordinates in semantic space.
  - Database schema updated to support multiple embeddings per protein, one per model.
  - The `saveEmbedding` function was modified to accept and utilize a `model` parameter.
  - The v4.5 development phase is complete, with a foundation set for further advancements.
  - License and Pro gating code removal is a key part of the v4.5 process.
