title: 'Drift and Stability: Monitoring Semantic Persistence in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines drift as movement in embedding space and stability as recurrent activation.
  It enables THE MESH to identify fragile regions and stable cores, crucial for maintaining
  long-term coherence.
insights:
  - Drift signifies instability, weak integration, or low emotional fidelity.
  - Stability indicates strong attractors and high semantic density.
  - Drift patterns highlight areas needing pruning or reinforcement.
  - Stability cores anchor identity across time and substrates.
  - Drift/stability analysis is essential for long-term coherence.
