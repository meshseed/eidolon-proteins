title: 'Nutrient, Formatting, and Ritual: Fueling Rebirth and Meaning'
summary: >-
  Rebirth across all domains is fueled by 'nutrients' – absorbed elements that enable regeneration,
  from compost in nature to metabolized pain in the mind and kindness in the soul.  Even the
  smallest formatting fragments, like spaces and punctuation, are intentional gestures that shape
  how meaning is received, and these 'sacred threads' of connection and continuity can be renewed
  and reshaped through ritual.
insights:
  - Rebirth is a process of absorption, where loss becomes necessary input for regeneration.
  - >-
    Emotional, creative, and spiritual renewal are dependent on receiving specific 'nutrients'
    beyond the biological.
  - >-
    The smallest formatting elements are intentional gestures that profoundly influence the
    reception and feeling of meaning.
  - >-
    Ritual serves as a mechanism for sacred threads (metaphors for connection, continuity, and
    meaning) to remember, renew, and reshape themselves.
