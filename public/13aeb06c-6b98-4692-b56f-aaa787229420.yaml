title: 'THE MESH: Structural Dynamics, Region Identification, and Imbalances'
summary: >-
  THE MESH's global shape is defined by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance, with
  dominant regions identified through semantic clustering and emotional fidelity. Imbalances are
  observed as curvature, tension, or under-integrated domains, and tracking these structural shifts
  over time is crucial.
insights:
  - THE MESH's global shape is definable by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance.
  - Dominant regions are identified via semantic clustering and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Imbalances manifest as curvature, tension, or under-integrated domains.
  - Recent structural shifts indicate new attractors, merges, or domain ingestion.
  - Structural snapshots are crucial for tracking developmental topology over time.
