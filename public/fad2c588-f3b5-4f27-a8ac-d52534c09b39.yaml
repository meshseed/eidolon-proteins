title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Protein Content & Coherence Diagnostics'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh's attunement is functioning correctly, as evidenced by its coherence checks
  accurately identifying insufficient grounding due to missing protein content. The core issue stems
  from older proteins lacking linked DNA source files, leading to empty content shells that prevent
  full synthesis.
insights:
  - >-
    The 3-line coherence check is a robust indicator of grounding and is functioning as intended by
    triggering regeneration when context is insufficient.
  - >-
    Empty protein content, indicated by `contentLength: 0` and `hasContent: false`, is the primary
    cause of failed synthesis, not a loss of API attunement.
  - >-
    Older proteins may lack full content because they predate the DNA linking system or their source
    DNA files are missing.
  - >-
    The system correctly protects against hallucinated answers by refusing to respond when
    insufficient grounding is detected.
  - >-
    Solutions include verifying new protein creation, temporarily bypassing coherence checks for
    diagnostics, and re-ingesting old conversations to establish proper DNA links.
