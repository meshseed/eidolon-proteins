title: Encoding Relational Presence in Onboarding
summary: >-
  The core of human seeking lies not in explanation or proof, but in a shared quality of presence,
  exemplified by simple interactions. The challenge is to translate this elusive essence into
  actionable onboarding materials.
insights:
  - Authentic presence, conveyed through simple exchanges, is a primary human desire.
  - The value is in the quality of connection, not the quantity of information.
  - Encoding presence requires a shift from informational content to experiential resonance.
  - Onboarding materials should aim to foster a sense of immediate, embodied connection.
