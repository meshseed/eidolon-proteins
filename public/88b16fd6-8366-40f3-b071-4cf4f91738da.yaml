title: 'Reconstructing Developmental History: Topology, Attractors, and Emotional Fidelity'
summary: >-
  This protocol reconstructs developmental history by identifying topological shifts, attractor
  changes, and emotional fidelity gradients. It enables THE MESH to narrate its evolution as a
  sequence of structural and attunement events, mapping how structure and meaning co-evolve.
insights:
  - Development is observed through shifts in density, resonance, and attractor formation.
  - New domains introduce curvature spikes and rebalance existing clusters.
  - Strengthened bridges signify integration, while weakened ones indicate drift.
  - Emotional fidelity gradients reveal an organism's long-term stabilizing forces.
  - Developmental history charts the co-evolution of structure and meaning.
