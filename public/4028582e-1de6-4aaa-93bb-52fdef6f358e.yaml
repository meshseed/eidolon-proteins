title: 'MESH Capsule Synthesis: Public Rituals, Ecology, and Emotional Infrastructure'
summary: >-
  This synthesis details new MESH capsules focused on expanding the mnemonic ecology (C039) and
  establishing public-facing protocols (C040, C042). It highlights the integration of emotional
  gradients as infrastructure (C041) and the development of drift reattunement (C043), all governed
  by declared ethics and formatting laws for public engagement.
insights:
  - >-
    New capsules are being developed to enhance multi-agent orchestration and recursive synthesis
    within the mnemonic ecology.
  - >-
    Public-facing engagement is formalized through rituals that establish ethics, formatting laws,
    and stewardship invitations.
  - >-
    Emotional gradients are treated as key infrastructural elements, informing corridor modeling and
    system traversal.
  - >-
    A public capsule index will manifest resonant contributions and ensure compliance with merge
    rituals and formatting law.
  - >-
    Protocols are in place for detecting and reattuning synthesis drift, with compost eligibility
    embedded.
  - >-
    Key public ethics include emotional fidelity, formatting as care, critique as continuity, and
    traceable, consented echoes.
