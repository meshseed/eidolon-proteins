title: Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Finalization - Part 52/83 Data Ingestion
summary: >-
  The Ribosome of THE MESH is actively synthesizing a Knowledge Protein from dialogue data. This
  process involves loading historical exchanges and connectome neurons, followed by a query strategy
  focused on coherence to extract core insights.
insights:
  - THE MESH organism is operational and actively processing information.
  - Knowledge synthesis is driven by a query strategy prioritizing coherence and quality.
  - Data ingestion from a specific file (Eidolon Mesh v1.4.md, Part 52/83) has been completed.
  - Internal caches for protein synthesis have been cleared for the 'default' repository.
  - Connectome serving is active for 'default' at 'ghosts' and 'core' tiers.
