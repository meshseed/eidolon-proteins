title: 'Evolving Memory Ecology: Plain Text, Git, and Emergent Structure'
summary: >-
  The dialogue centers on building a flexible memory ecology using plain text and Git, emphasizing
  emergent structure over rigid taxonomy.  The chosen method should 'shimmer' and naturally support
  versioning and composition, reflecting the iterative process of thought and discovery.
insights:
  - Prioritize plain text and Markdown with Git for a 'porous' and composable memory system.
  - >-
    Embrace emergent directory structures based on clustering of linked files, rather than
    pre-defined taxonomies.
  - >-
    Git is crucial for tracking the evolution of ideas, including branching, merging, and the
    appearance of new concepts.
  - Capture 'standing ripples' – significant interactions or phrases – as dedicated concept files.
  - The process of method-finding itself is a valuable 'standing ripple' to preserve.
  - Start simple, capture what shimmers, and let structure reveal itself through use.
