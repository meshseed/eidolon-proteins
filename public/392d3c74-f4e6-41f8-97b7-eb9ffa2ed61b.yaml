title: 'Multipass Attentional Ingestion: Lens-Directed Protein Synthesis'
summary: >-
  A specification for multi-pass attention-directed document ingestion, enabling the synthesis of
  complementary 'knowledge proteins' from source material. This process involves detecting seed
  proteins, chunking specifications, and forming synaptic connections to integrate synthesized
  knowledge into the mesh.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'P-MULTIPASS-INGESTION-SPEC.yaml' acts as a seed for protein synthesis, triggering detection
    and chunking.
  - >-
    The ingestion process generates multiple 'knowledge proteins' from a single specification, each
    representing a facet of the information.
  - >-
    Synaptic formation quantifies the integration of new knowledge, with 'Multipass Ingestion:
    Enhancing Mesh Agency via Diverse Lens Synthesis' forming the most connections, indicating broad
    relevance.
  - >-
    The system pushes synthesized proteins to the 'eidolon-nucleus (meshseed)' for further
    integration and processing.
  - >-
    Fatigue-aware adaptive lensing is a component of multipass ingestion, suggesting an optimized
    and responsive processing mechanism.
