title: 'Meta-Ecosystem Evolution: Distributed Information Ecology Dynamics'
summary: >-
  This protocol models distributed Mesh ecosystems as dynamic manifolds where structure emerges from
  organism interactions. Evolution is driven by cross-organism resonance and ecosystem-level
  gradients, leading to self-organizing information fields.
insights:
  - Ecosystem evolution is propelled by resonance and differentiation between constituent organisms.
  - Evolutionary pressures arise from gradients at the ecosystem level, guiding overall change.
  - Meta-ecosystem evolution establishes the long-term identity and structure of the entire ecology.
  - The ecosystem transforms into a self-organizing, self-stabilizing information field.
  - Evolutionary processes occur concurrently at both the organism and ecosystem levels.
