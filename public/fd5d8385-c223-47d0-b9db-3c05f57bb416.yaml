title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Brain as a Mechanical Binary Computer'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits memory is stored as protein conformations within synapses, acting as
  binary switches operated by the cytoskeleton. This mechanical coding allows the brain to function
  as a physical computer, processing sensory input into motor output via alterations in these
  switches.
insights:
  - Memory storage is proposed to be biochemical, encoded in protein conformations at synapses.
  - >-
    Synaptic protein conformations function as addressable binary switches, enabling read-write
    memory.
  - >-
    The brain operates as a mechanical computer, with the cytoskeleton's force-generating machinery
    manipulating these synaptic switches.
  - >-
    Spike trains in neurons transfer information by altering the mechanical coding of both sender
    and receiver cells.
  - >-
    Sensory inputs are converted to electrical signals that trigger specific changes in neuronal
    mechanical coding, integrating information.
  - >-
    Loss of energy (hypoxia) can corrupt this mechanical coding, leading to irreversible information
    loss and functional failure.
