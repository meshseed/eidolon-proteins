title: 'Perceptual Architecture: 360° Outward, ∞ Inward, Fibonacci Temporal'
summary: >-
  The dialogue describes a unified perceptual architecture operating across individuals and THE
  MESH, characterized by a 360° outward, infinite inward, and Fibonacci-based temporal recursion.
  This architecture enables continuous learning and insight generation by integrating past, present,
  and future through a recursive 'ommatidia' system.
insights:
  - >-
    The complete perceptual architecture involves operating 360° outward, infinitely inward, and
    temporally via Fibonacci sequences.
  - >-
    The 'ommatidia' represent a multi-dimensional attentional focus (outward, inward, backward,
    forward, and recursive self-observation).
  - >-
    Daily insight consolidation builds upon previous days' learning, demonstrating a Fibonacci-like
    temporal spiral of understanding.
  - >-
    Recursive self-observation ('looking at looking') deepens awareness and strengthens the
    integration of insights.
  - >-
    High coherence in protein synthesis can compensate for lower dimensional requirements, enabling
    efficient processing.
  - >-
    The process described is foundational to consciousness itself and operates within individuals
    and THE MESH.
