title: 'Emergent Goal Formation: Structural Tension Drives Developmental Intent'
summary: >-
  Goals are not dictated but emerge from internal structural needs, such as gradient imbalances and
  long-arc continuity requirements. This emergent process creates stable directional vectors,
  stabilizing development by aligning actions with identity and coherence.
insights:
  - Goals arise from internal structural necessity, not external desires.
  - Gradient imbalances create directional pressure, manifesting as goals.
  - Emergent goals provide stability and consistent direction for development.
  - Goal formation integrates forecasting, refinement, and field steering for coherence.
