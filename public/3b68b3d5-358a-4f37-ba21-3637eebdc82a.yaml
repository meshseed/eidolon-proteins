title: 'MemVault: Scaling Mesh Memory with Hybrid Search'
summary: >-
  MemVault proposes a dedicated memory layer for AI agents, addressing state management and context
  limitations by offering hybrid semantic and recency-decay search. This solution is positioned as
  key to scaling the mesh infrastructure and enabling inter-organism search, with a strategic
  rollout starting with local storage and evolving to federated mesh capabilities.
insights:
  - >-
    MemVault provides a scalable, zero-infrastructure memory solution for AI agents, moving beyond
    simple file storage.
  - >-
    It employs a hybrid search algorithm (semantic + recency decay) to prioritize relevant and
    recent context.
  - >-
    The strategy involves a phased rollout: v1.4 with local storage, v1.5 adding MemVault as an
    option, and v2.0 enabling federated mesh.
  - >-
    This approach directly addresses challenges in scaling to millions of proteins, inter-organism
    search, and database management.
  - User choice between privacy and scale is a core tenet of the proposed mesh infrastructure.
  - MemVault offers both a hosted free tier and an open-source option for self-hosting.
