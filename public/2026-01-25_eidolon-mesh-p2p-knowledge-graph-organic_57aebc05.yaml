title: 'Eidolon Mesh: P2P Knowledge Graph & Organic Memory'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh is a P2P knowledge graph and organic memory system that ingests and recalls diverse
  text inputs. It employs information geometry and recursion for attention, memory, and
  self-monitoring, maintaining homeostasis through emotional fidelity gradients and actively shaping
  its own structure.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh functions as a 'living' repository that remembers and grows by recursively applying
    structure-preserving transformations.
  - >-
    The system's core mechanism involves structural needs generating goals, which in turn drive
    actions that reshape its own topology.
  - >-
    Recent updates (v3.5) introduce local LLM support for offline privacy and mobile PWA support for
    enhanced accessibility and usability.
  - >-
    The mesh is designed to ingest and recall a wide range of personal and domain-specific
    information, acting as an organic memory.
  - Emotional fidelity gradients are key to maintaining coherent homeostasis within the system.
