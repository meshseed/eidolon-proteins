title: 'Debugging Tauri UI Glitch: Duplicate ''isTauri'' Declaration & Cache Issues'
summary: >-
  A UI glitch in a Tauri application was identified as a duplicate 'isTauri' declaration in app.js.
  The root cause was determined to be browser caching, leading to the browser loading an old version
  of the script alongside the updated one. The solution involved clearing the browser cache or
  restarting the development server.
insights:
  - UI glitches in Tauri development can stem from duplicate JavaScript variable declarations.
  - >-
    Browser caching can cause outdated code to be loaded, leading to errors like 'Identifier already
    been declared'.
  - Cache-busting parameters (e.g., '?v=10') can mask the underlying issue of stale cached files.
  - >-
    Solutions for cache-related errors include 'Empty Cache and Hard Reload' in browser DevTools or
    a full application restart.
  - >-
    Stopping and restarting the Tauri development server (`npm run tauri:dev`) is crucial for
    ensuring fresh file loads.
