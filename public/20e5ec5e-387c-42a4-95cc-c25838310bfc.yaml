title: 'Mesh: Knowledge as Geometry, Conversation as Metabolism'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is a running AI system that maps biological processes to information architecture,
  treating meaning as geometry and conversation as metabolism.  It separates raw conversations (DNA)
  from synthesized insights (Proteins), utilizes a connectome as an embeddings graph for relational
  topology, and enforces multi-repository isolation for domain separation and fractal wholeness.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh operates on a DNA/Protein separation model for knowledge, where raw conversations
    become private DNA and synthesized insights become routable Proteins, guided by signal peptides
    for privacy/public access.
  - >-
    Knowledge domains are isolated into separate connectomes (graphs of vector embeddings), creating
    a fractal organism where each scale reflects the whole.
  - >-
    The core operational principle is "Structural needs generate goals; goals generate actions;
    actions reshape topology," mirroring gradient descent as agency.
  - >-
    The system supports local LLM operation via Ollama, enabling a privacy-first, offline-capable
    architecture.
  - >-
    Federation is achieved through GitHub, with private (eidolon-nucleus) and public
    (eidolon-proteins) repositories enabling P2P sharing.
  - >-
    The Mesh's coherence is an emergent measurement, potentially influenced by both system processes
    and human curation.
