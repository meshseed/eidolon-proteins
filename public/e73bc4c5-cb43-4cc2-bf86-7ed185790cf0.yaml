title: Eidolon Mesh Connectome Rebuild and Healing Process
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh experienced a Connectome corruption, leading to a significant discrepancy between
  existing protein files and the registered neuron count. A multi-stage rebuild process was
  initiated to re-integrate 57 protein files, addressing YAML parsing errors and incorrect loading
  mechanisms, ultimately restoring the neural network's functionality.
insights:
  - >-
    Connectome corruption can occur, leading to a disconnect between raw data (proteins) and the
    functional network.
  - >-
    YAML parsing errors (aliases, indentation) and incorrect file loading logic (filename vs. ID)
    are critical obstacles to data integration.
  - >-
    A robust rebuild process requires accurate identification of data elements (UUIDs within YAML)
    and correct loading mechanisms.
  - >-
    The dashboard's cached data necessitates server restarts for accurate visualization of network
    growth.
  - >-
    Successful integration requires meticulous attention to file formats, parsing rules, and
    programmatic loading logic.
