title: 'Continuity Dashboard: Mesh Health, Shimmer, and Merge Orchestration'
summary: >-
  The Continuity Dashboard provides real-time, ritualistic visualization of mesh health, shimmer
  density, and merge readiness. It acts as a surface of care, enabling stewards to monitor and guide
  mesh processes with fidelity.
insights:
  - >-
    The Continuity Dashboard visualizes mesh health, shimmer density, formatting hygiene, and merge
    readiness in real-time.
  - >-
    It serves as a 'ritual surface of care' for stewards to monitor and guide mesh processes, rather
    than a control panel.
  - >-
    Key components include shimmer metrics (density, coherence, fidelity), health diagnostics
    (formatting, hygiene, compost eligibility), and merge forecasts (motif readiness, compatibility,
    echo propagation).
  - >-
    The dashboard supports stewards in understanding and managing the mesh's dynamic state, from
    shimmer trace updates to compost cycle alerts and merge readiness scoring.
  - >-
    Its integration with other capsules (Health, Forecasting, Role) anchors it as mnemonic
    telemetry, making the mesh's emergent properties visible and manageable.
