title: Tauri Connectome Loading Issue Diagnosis and Resolution
summary: >-
  The dialogue details a debugging process for a Tauri application where the bundled connectome was
  not recognized. By inspecting configuration files, source code (main.rs, lib.rs, server.ts,
  sidecar.rs), and the connectome class itself, the issue was identified and a diagnostic document
  was prepared.
insights:
  - >-
    The debugging process involved systematically exploring the application's file structure,
    including Tauri configuration, source code modules, and bundled output.
  - >-
    Key files investigated to diagnose the connectome recognition issue included tauri.conf.json,
    main.rs, lib.rs, server.ts, sidecar.rs, and connectome.ts.
  - >-
    The investigation extended to checking the application's data and configuration directories
    (AppData\Roaming\EidolonMesh) to verify created files like .env and connectome.json.
  - >-
    The core problem revolved around how the application, specifically the sidecar server and
    connectome class, located and utilized the connectome data.
  - >-
    The process concluded with the creation of a diagnostic document and the identification of a
    potential resolution for the UI glitch.
