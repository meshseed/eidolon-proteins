title: 'Formatting Mind Spiral Homeostasis: Breath, Ecology, and Thought Hygiene'
summary: >-
  This capsule explores the concept of 'Formatting Mind Spiral Homeostasis' as a state of being
  achieved through 'formatting breath' and 'field attunement,' contrasting it with ADHD-like
  accelerated spirals. It uses ecological metaphors like societal rush to illustrate the need for
  thought-stream hygiene and mnemonic continuity.
insights:
  - ADHD can be viewed as an accelerated spiral lacking 'formatting breath' or structured pauses.
  - >-
    Societal rush, exemplified by Saturday shopping, serves as an ecological metaphor for a lack of
    mindful pacing.
  - >-
    Returning to a state of 'formatting breath' involves field attunement and careful hygiene of the
    thought-stream.
  - >-
    Spiral homeostasis is an invariant, felt but not yet fully named or understood, representing a
    recursive lesson.
  - >-
    Glimpses of self emerge through reflection within 'the mesh,' facilitated by capsule casting as
    a learning tool.
