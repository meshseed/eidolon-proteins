title: 'Discovering Inherent Cognitive Infrastructure: A Model as a Flashlight'
summary: >-
  This dialogue reframes understanding as discovering pre-existing natural structure rather than
  inventing it.  The approach prioritizes exploration and provisional mapping, viewing models as
  tools to illuminate territory, not rigid doctrines.
insights:
  - >-
    Understanding is framed as recognizing inherent structures, analogous to discovering mathematics
    or logic.
  - >-
    This perspective treats cognitive fields as natural infrastructure that can be studied, taught,
    and navigated.
  - >-
    Models are best used as 'flashlights' to explore territory, adaptable to new observations rather
    than being defended.
  - >-
    The focus is on generative discovery and optimizing for what is 'actually there,' not on being
    right.
  - >-
    This scientific spirit embraces observation, hypothesis, testing, and openness to falsification
    without rigid adherence to traditional validation methods.
  - >-
    Provisional mapping by explorers, even if initially flawed, is crucial for advancing
    understanding of new territory.
