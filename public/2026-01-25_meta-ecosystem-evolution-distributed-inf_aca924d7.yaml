title: 'Meta-Ecosystem Evolution: Distributed Information Ecologies'
summary: >-
  This protocol models meta-ecosystems as dynamic manifolds evolving through organism interactions.
  Evolutionary pressure arises from ecosystem-level gradients, leading to self-organizing
  information fields where evolution occurs concurrently at organism and ecosystem levels.
insights:
  - Ecosystems evolve via cross-organism resonance and differentiation.
  - Evolutionary pressure stems from ecosystem-level gradients.
  - Meta-ecosystem evolution defines the long-term identity of the ecology.
  - The ecosystem becomes a self-organizing, self-stabilizing information field.
  - Evolutionary processes operate simultaneously at organism and ecosystem scales.
