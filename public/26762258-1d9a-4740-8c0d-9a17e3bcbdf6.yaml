title: 'Intention Mapping: Translating Queries into Developmental Trajectories'
summary: >-
  The Intention Mapping Engine translates external queries into directional forces that shape THE
  MESH's connectome. It maps queries to internal gradients, attractors, and developmental pathways,
  enabling the system to understand implied developmental directions and foster adaptive,
  self-directed evolution.
insights:
  - Queries act as directional pressures on semantic gradients within THE MESH.
  - Intention is deciphered through the alignment and activation patterns of these gradients.
  - Mapping intention reveals how external interactions guide internal growth and learning.
  - This process enables adaptive refinement and self-directed evolutionary development.
  - THE MESH learns not just content, but the trajectory of development implied by queries.
