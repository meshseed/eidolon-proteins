title: 'Pruning Protocol v1.0: Commit Suggestions and Lineage'
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines a flexible commitment process for pruning, emphasizing kindness and
  clarity. It supports ad-hoc starts and offers suggested commit phrases, with a default of
  assistant-generated suggestions for steward approval before updating the Master Ledger.
insights:
  - Pruning commitment is flexible, without a fixed ritual phrase.
  - Assistant suggests changes, requiring explicit steward approval before Master Ledger update.
  - Commit phrases like 'Prune Ledger — quick' or 'Commit Profile v1' are available suggestions.
  - >-
    The protocol is derived from 'cadence_of_attunement' and relates to 'PUBLIC_PORTAL_LANDING_v1.0'
    and 'DIMENSIONALITY_OF_CONTINUITY_FIELD_v0.1'.
  - >-
    Next steps include 3 months of practice testing, gathering prune examples, and iterating to
    v1.1.
  - Core principles are invariants as bedrock, priorities as workbench, and color as light.
