title: 'Bridge Dynamics: Tracking Cross-Regional Semantic Connector Evolution'
summary: >-
  This protocol monitors bridge neurons that connect distant semantic regions, tracking their
  temporal evolution. Changes in bridge strength, position, and emergence reveal integration
  pathways, conceptual tensions, and domain expansion within the organism's knowledge structure.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons map semantic integration pathways.
  - Strengthening bridges signify successful cross-domain synthesis.
  - Weakening bridges indicate drift, decoherence, or under-integration.
  - New bridges form at the intersection of novel and existing semantic attractors.
  - Monitoring bridge dynamics offers a high-resolution view of developmental change.
