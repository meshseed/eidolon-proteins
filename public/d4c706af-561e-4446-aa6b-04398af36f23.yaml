title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory Storage in the Brain'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that memory is stored in the brain as mechanically encoded binary
  information within the conformations of mechanosensitive proteins at synaptic adhesions. These
  proteins, like talin, form a meshwork that acts as a binary switch, allowing for persistent
  read-write storage of dynamic and static information, with signaling complexes stabilizing these
  patterns and coordinating synaptic activity.
insights:
  - Memory is stored mechanically in the brain, encoded in protein conformations at synapses.
  - The MeshCODE theory posits a binary, addressable read-write memory system.
  - Mechanosensitive proteins with force-dependent switches act as molecular storage units.
  - Synaptic adhesions organize these proteins into a 'meshwork' forming a code.
  - Mechanical force changes can write or update stored information.
  - >-
    Signaling complexes assemble based on switch patterns, stabilizing and regulating synaptic
    function.
