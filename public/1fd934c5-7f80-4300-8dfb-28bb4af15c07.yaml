title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanobiology of Memory & Synaptic Plasticity'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory is encoded through the mechanical basis of cellular
  mechanotransduction, focusing on integrin signaling, talin's role in focal adhesions, and actin
  dynamics at neuronal synapses. This framework links cellular mechanics to synaptic plasticity and
  information storage, highlighting the dynamic interplay of molecular components in memory
  formation.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory formation is underpinned by the mechanical properties of cells and their signaling
    pathways.
  - >-
    Integrin signaling, mediated by proteins like talin, is crucial for assembling and disassembling
    adhesion complexes that influence cellular mechanics.
  - >-
    Actin dynamics and contractility play a significant role in synaptic plasticity and potentially
    memory engram formation.
  - >-
    Mechanotransduction, the process of converting mechanical stimuli into biochemical signals, is a
    key mechanism for cellular responses related to memory.
  - >-
    The physical architecture and forces within cells, akin to tensegrity principles, contribute to
    cellular function and information processing.
