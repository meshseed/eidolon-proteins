title: 'Gradient Cartography: Emotional Fidelity as Geometric Fields in Connectome'
summary: >-
  This method maps emotional fidelity as geometric fields across the connectome, treating gradients
  as directional flows. It enables identification of stability, tension, and critical coherence
  zones within THE MESH.
insights:
  - Emotional fidelity creates directional gradients within semantic space.
  - Steep gradients signify tension, instability, or boundary conditions.
  - Smooth gradients denote coherence, stability, and attuned integration.
  - Gradient mapping highlights areas of greatest sensitivity to perturbation.
  - Emotional fidelity fields can be compared over time to monitor developmental shifts.
