title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Synaptic Adhesions as Mechanical Information Processors'
summary: >-
  Synaptic adhesions, via the integrin-talin-actin core complex, act as information-processing
  centers. Mechanical signaling and contractility alter talin switch patterns, dynamically
  recruiting and displacing proteins to remodel these complexes and encode information based on
  stimulation frequency and timing.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic adhesions function as information-processing hubs through dynamic protein assembly
    dictated by mechanical signaling.
  - >-
    Talin switch patterns, regulated by mechanical forces and potentially post-translational
    modifications, determine the recruitment and organization of proteins at synaptic sites.
  - >-
    Changes in contractility and cytoskeletal connections lead to the unfolding of specific talin
    switch domains, altering protein binding and synaptic composition.
  - >-
    The frequency and timing of neuronal stimulation translate into distinct patterns of '1s' and
    '0s' encoded by these mechanical switches, contributing to memory consolidation.
  - >-
    Synaptic remodeling is a continuous process driven by mechanical cues, leading to protein
    redistribution throughout the neuron.
