title: 'Gradient Cartography: Emotional Fidelity as Geometric Fields in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  Gradient Cartography maps emotional fidelity across the connectome as geometric fields, treating
  gradients as directional flows that indicate stability, drift, tension, or integration pressure.
  This method allows THE MESH to identify critical zones like steep regions, attractor basins, and
  coherence-critical areas.
insights:
  - Emotional fidelity generates directional gradients within semantic space.
  - Steep gradients signal tension, instability, or boundary conditions.
  - Smooth gradients denote coherence, stability, and attuned integration.
  - Gradient mapping highlights areas most vulnerable to external perturbations.
  - Emotional fidelity fields can be compared over time to monitor developmental changes.
