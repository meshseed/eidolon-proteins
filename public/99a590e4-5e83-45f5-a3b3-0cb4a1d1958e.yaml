title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Cellular Signaling'
summary: >-
  This content synthesizes research on the mechanical basis of memory, exploring how extracellular
  rigidity influences cellular signaling through talin and integrin pathways. It highlights the role
  of Rho GTPase signaling, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and sleep cycles (specifically REM sleep) in
  memory consolidation and synaptic plasticity.
insights:
  - >-
    Extracellular rigidity is sensed by cells via talin isoform-specific mechanical linkages,
    impacting integrin-mediated adhesion.
  - >-
    Rho GTPase signaling is crucial for synaptic function and has implications for intellectual
    disability.
  - The actin cytoskeleton plays a vital role in dendritic spines for maintaining long-term memory.
  - REM sleep theta rhythm is causally linked to contextual memory consolidation.
  - Spike timing-dependent plasticity acts as a learning rule for dendritic integration.
  - GEFs and GAPs are critical regulators of small G protein activity.
