title: 'MeshCODE: Memory, Synapses, and Cellular Mechanisms'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory explores the mechanical basis of memory, linking cellular processes like Rho
  GTPase signaling, integrin activation, and cytoskeletal dynamics to synaptic plasticity and memory
  formation. It highlights the role of sleep and neuronal activity in consolidating associative
  memories, suggesting a complex interplay between molecular switches and network-level processes.
insights:
  - >-
    Rho GTPase signaling is crucial for cell migration and invasion, implying a role in neuronal
    structural plasticity.
  - >-
    Integrin activation operates as a binary switch, vital for adhesion maturation and potentially
    synaptic stabilization.
  - >-
    Synaptic tagging and subsequent protein synthesis are key mechanisms for long-term memory
    storage, with local synthesis playing a role.
  - >-
    Slow wave sleep and hippocampal network activity, particularly ripples, are implicated in memory
    consolidation and synaptic down-regulation.
  - >-
    The axonal cytoskeleton's nano-architecture and extracellular matrix influence dendritic spine
    and synapse structure and plasticity.
  - >-
    Associative memory formation requires early tagging of cortical networks, suggesting a temporal
    component to memory encoding.
