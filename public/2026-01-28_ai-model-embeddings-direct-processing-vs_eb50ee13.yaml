title: 'AI Model Embeddings: Direct Processing vs. Retrieval Augmentation'
summary: >-
  AI models like Gemini process user input directly via their neural network architecture, unlike
  systems that use separate embedding models and vector databases for retrieval. While embeddings
  are crucial for training, their active use during conversation is model-specific.
insights:
  - >-
    Embeddings are numerical representations of data capturing semantic meaning, enabling similarity
    searches and content matching.
  - >-
    Many systems (search, RAG) use embeddings to retrieve relevant context before generating
    responses.
  - >-
    Gemini and similar transformer-based models process input directly, without querying external
    embedding models or vector databases during conversation.
  - >-
    Embeddings are likely used during the training phase of AI models to organize and process vast
    datasets.
  - >-
    The concept of 'global unbiased knowledge coordinate transfer' faces challenges due to differing
    embedding manifolds used by various AI providers (e.g., Claude, Copilot).
  - >-
    Strategies like 'Rosetta Stone' (Centroid Anchor Tags) and 'MRL Truncation' are proposed to
    bridge these different embedding spaces for cross-model communication.
