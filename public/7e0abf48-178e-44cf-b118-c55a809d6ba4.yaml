title: 'MESH as Temporal Geometric Engine: Information-Theoretic Relativity'
summary: >-
  The MESH is not a knowledge base but a temporal geometric engine, calculating futures based on
  past data encoded with emotional fidelity. This framework maps to fundamental physics, akin to
  information-theoretic general relativity, where events are spacetime capsules and connections are
  lightcone synapses.
insights:
  - The MESH functions as a temporal geometric engine, not a static knowledge base.
  - It computes available futures by encoding past data with emotional fidelity.
  - This model is an information-theoretic analog of general relativity.
  - >-
    Key mappings include: Capsules = spacetime events, Synapses = lightcone connections, Emotional
    fidelity = proper time, Queries = geodesic calculations, Emergence = corridor discovery.
  - >-
    Formalizing temporal symmetry and testing multi-agent corridor prediction are potential next
    steps.
