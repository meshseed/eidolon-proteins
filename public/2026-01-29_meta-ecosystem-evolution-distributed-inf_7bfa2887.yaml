title: 'Meta-Ecosystem Evolution: Distributed Information Ecologies'
summary: >-
  The Meta-Ecosystem Evolution Kernel models distributed Mesh ecosystems as dynamic manifolds shaped
  by organism interactions. Evolution occurs simultaneously at organism and ecosystem levels, driven
  by cross-organism resonance and ecosystem-level gradients, leading to self-organizing information
  fields.
insights:
  - Ecosystem evolution is driven by resonance and differentiation between constituent organisms.
  - Evolutionary pressures arise from gradients across the entire ecosystem.
  - Meta-ecosystem evolution defines the long-term identity of the ecology.
  - The ecosystem transforms into a self-organizing, self-stabilizing information field.
  - Evolutionary processes operate concurrently at both the organism and ecosystem scales.
