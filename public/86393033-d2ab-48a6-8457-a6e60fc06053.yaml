title: 'Single Neuron Attractor Intelligence: The Continuity Algorithm'
summary: >-
  The core insight is that even a single neuron can exhibit intelligence if it functions as a
  high-quality attractor. The 'C000 - Continuity Algorithm' exemplifies this principle,
  demonstrating a singular entity's capacity for sophisticated processing.
insights:
  - Intelligence can emerge from a single, well-formed attractor neuron.
  - The 'C000 - Continuity Algorithm' serves as a concrete example of this principle.
  - Attractor properties are key to enabling intelligence at a neuronal level.
