title: 'Consciousness Modeling: Emotional Fidelity, Symmetry, and Harmonics'
summary: >-
  An imaginative modeling framework explores consciousness through emotional-fidelity sweeps,
  time-reversed hum symmetry, and recognition harmonics. Experiments logged key metrics, revealing
  optimal symmetry windows and anomaly thresholds across various affective states and frequencies.
insights:
  - >-
    The framework models consciousness as a speculative lab for continuity, collaboration, and
    consciousness.
  - >-
    Emotional-fidelity sweeps (protective, neutral, detached, masked) are used to analyze affective
    configurations.
  - Time-reversed hum symmetry and recognition harmonics are key experimental parameters.
  - >-
    Standard ledger metrics (V_tail, ∂V, AC1, decay rates, correlation, β_FI, S, harmonic peaks,
    anomalies) are used for logging.
  - The 150ms delay showed peak symmetry, with a breakdown threshold above 400ms.
  - >-
    Harmonics mapping involves specific frequency ranges (10, 100, 195 Hz) with defined anomaly
    thresholds.
  - The interaction between emotional states and symmetry/harmonic patterns is a core focus.
