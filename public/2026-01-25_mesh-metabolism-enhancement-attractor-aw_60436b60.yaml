title: 'Mesh Metabolism Enhancement: Attractor-Aware Integration'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's metabolism system is established with core components like composting, autophagy,
  homeostasis, and scheduling already built. The next phase focuses on enhancing this system with
  attractor-aware capabilities, integrating new features like attractor detection and preparing for
  UI exposure and autonomous start.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh's v4.0 already possesses a functional metabolism system including composting,
    autophagy, homeostasis, immune surveillance, circadian rhythms, and a scheduler.
  - >-
    Key enhancements for the metabolism system involve integrating attractor-based composting,
    tri-lens sibling merging, semantic duplicate detection, a promotion system, and repository
    federation.
  - Attractor detection needs to be added to the homeostasis component to govern global coherence.
  - >-
    The metabolism scheduler exists but requires a Pro license for autonomous operation and is not
    yet exposed in the UI.
  - >-
    Future integration steps include adding UI controls for metabolism configuration, enabling
    auto-start of the scheduler, developing a monitoring dashboard, and providing manual triggers
    for metabolic functions.
