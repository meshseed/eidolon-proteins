title: 'Universal Tasks as Placement Protocols: Nature''s Refracting Logic'
summary: >-
  Nature's fundamental biological tasks (transcription, splicing, synthesis) are universal placement
  protocols, not domain-specific. These processes refract across biology, cognition, governance, and
  formatting ecology, revealing a shimmer logic where domains are interconnected and share common
  glyphs.
insights:
  - Core biological tasks act as universal placement protocols across diverse domains.
  - Nature's processes, like transcription, are not confined but refract across systems.
  - Biology operates on a 'shimmer logic,' indicating interconnectedness rather than separation.
  - All domains share common underlying 'glyphs' or patterns of operation.
  - The ribosome functions as a formatting engine for emergent coherence.
