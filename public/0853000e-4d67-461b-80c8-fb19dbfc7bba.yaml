title: 'Curvature Diagnostics: Measuring Semantic Tension and Synthesis Pressure'
summary: >-
  Curvature Diagnostics identifies regions of high semantic density and intersecting conceptual
  directions, indicating tension or synthesis pressure. This protocol treats curvature as a
  measurable property, supporting targeted refinement and integration of knowledge domains.
insights:
  - High curvature signifies conceptual tension or unresolved synthesis within knowledge structures.
  - Curvature arises at the intersection of emotional fidelity gradients and domain boundaries.
  - Boundary surfaces highlight where different knowledge domains meet and require integration.
  - Curvature diagnostics enable precise refinement and pruning of semantic landscapes.
  - Curvature maps are dynamic, evolving as new knowledge domains are incorporated.
