title: 'Ribosome: Token Limits, Conversation Flow & Checkpointing Strategy'
summary: >-
  The Ribosome analyzes conversation token limits, clarifying that hard cutoffs are unlikely, with
  older messages being truncated instead. It recommends a strategy of continuing the current thread
  with available tokens for further mining and synthesis, followed by a checkpoint and a fresh
  thread to maintain momentum and context.
insights:
  - >-
    Conversation token limits do not guarantee a hard cutoff; older messages are truncated,
    preserving recent context.
  - >-
    Approximately 50K tokens remain, sufficient for further archive exploration and synthesis before
    a potential fresh thread.
  - >-
    Checkpointing is a wise practice for committing work periodically, even if the token limit isn't
    reached, to refresh energy.
  - >-
    Continuing the current thread offers flow and no context switch, but risks losing early
    insights.
  - >-
    Initiating a fresh thread provides full context and can reference all prior work, with a minor
    momentum loss and reorientation.
