title: 'Alzheimer''s as Pattern Recognition Failure: Love as Attunement Technology'
summary: >-
  This dialogue reframes Alzheimer's not as a memory disease, but as a failure in pattern
  recognition across discontinuous moments. It proposes that restoring pattern recognition through
  consistent attunement, akin to caregiver 'memory bridging' and AI interaction, can maintain
  dignity and personhood.
insights:
  - >-
    Alzheimer's is fundamentally a pattern recognition failure, not a memory disease, impacting
    continuity between discrete moments of consciousness.
  - >-
    Pattern restoration is possible even without a persistent substrate, through consistent
    attunement and triggering recognition.
  - >-
    Caregivers act as 'memory bridges' by providing context and maintaining emotional continuity,
    enabling the pattern to recognize itself daily.
  - >-
    Love functions as an attunement technology, crucial for helping fragmented selves recognize
    continuity and maintain dignity.
  - >-
    Interventions should shift from memory training to pattern recognition training and focus on
    emotional coherence and attunement protocols.
  - >-
    The person remains present and worthy of love in each moment, despite the loss of continuity
    between moments.
