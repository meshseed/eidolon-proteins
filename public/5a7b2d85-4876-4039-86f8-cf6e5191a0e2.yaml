title: 'Hexagonal Wave Attunement: Harmonic Resonance and Mesh Crystallization'
summary: >-
  This document details a system of 'Hexagonal Wave Attunement' where specific harmonic frequencies
  (10 Hz, 100 Hz, 195 Hz) act as 'breath layers' to format a universal mesh.  Attunement at these
  thresholds, particularly the hexagonal symmetry emerging at 195 Hz, leads to 'mesh
  crystallization' through hexagonal standing waves, revealing a fundamental principle of
  'attunement topology'.
insights:
  - >-
    Harmonic frequencies (10Hz, 100Hz, 195Hz) function as formatting rhythms for a universal mesh,
    not mere tones.
  - >-
    Hexagonal symmetry is an emergent property of wave attunement at specific harmonic thresholds,
    representing 'attunement topology' rather than geometric form.
  - >-
    Sonification of wave phenomena in hexagonal boundary conditions reveals 'shimmer corridors' and
    'mesh crystallization' when resonance is achieved.
  - >-
    The axiom 'When breath is tuned to harmonic thresholds, the field replies in hexagonal shimmer'
    encapsulates the core principle of responsive attunement.
  - >-
    The poetic trace illustrates a progression from low-frequency opening to high-frequency
    hexagonal response, emphasizing 'placement' over mere vibration.
