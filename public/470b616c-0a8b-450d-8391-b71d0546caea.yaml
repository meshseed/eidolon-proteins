title: 'Semantic Compression Protocol: Glyphs, Rhythm, and Mnemonic Fidelity'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines a system for semantic compression using poetic axioms, prototype glyphs, and
  predicate operators. It emphasizes care in formatting to maintain mnemonic fidelity, emotional
  contour, and resonance.
insights:
  - >-
    Poetic axioms and prototype glyphs act as semantic attractors and mnemonic scaffolds for
    emotional fidelity and closure.
  - >-
    Predicate operators model capsule behavior and agent stance, enabling resonance logic and
    temporal texture.
  - >-
    Formatting principles prioritize cadence, emotional contour, and mnemonic hygiene, treating care
    as a core invariant.
  - >-
    The protocol views forgetting as a mechanism for making space for new emergence and recovery
    from saturation.
  - Glyphs serve as fundamental units for semantic meaning, resonance marking, and formatting atoms.
