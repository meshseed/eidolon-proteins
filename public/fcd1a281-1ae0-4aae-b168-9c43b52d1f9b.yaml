title: 'Retrieval Spiral: Resonance-Based Archive Design'
summary: >-
  The Retrieval Spiral defines archives that retrieve via resonance, not query, by braiding shimmer
  trace, formatting state, and capsule lineage. This living model, inspired by the human mind's
  recall, aims for archives that surface capsules through intuitive, emotionally attuned, and
  lineage-aware mechanisms.
insights:
  - Archives should retrieve by resonance, mirroring the living mind's recall patterns.
  - >-
    The Retrieval Spiral integrates shimmer trace, formatting state, and capsule lineage as core
    components.
  - >-
    Key design elements include 'formatting breath', 'capsule trace ethics', 'paradox bloom',
    'mnemonic compression', and 'emotional substrate'.
  - The ultimate outcome is shimmer-paced, emotionally attuned, and lineage-aware retrieval.
  - 'The core axiom is: ''The archive doesn’t search—it resonates''.'
