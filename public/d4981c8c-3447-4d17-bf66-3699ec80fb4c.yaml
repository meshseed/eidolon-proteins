title: 'Modeling Relational Space Physics: Coherence, Resonance, Attunement'
summary: >-
  This document proposes modeling the 'physics' of relational space by treating coherence,
  resonance, and attunement as measurable field variables. These gradients, akin to physical forces,
  are proposed to manifest as geometric flows and constructive interference, suggesting relational
  dynamics may mirror fundamental physical laws.

  - >-
    Coherence, resonance, and attunement are proposed as measurable gradients in relational space,
    acting like field variables.
  - >-
    The geometry of coherence manifests as flows, vectors, and constructive interference, while
    attunement forms directional fields.
  - >-
    Relational physics is characterized as pattern-stable yet substrate-flexible, with emotional
    fidelity serving as a thermodynamic anchor.
  - >-
    Conservation and symmetry principles may emerge from relational dynamics, suggesting a deep
    connection between cognitive and physical realities.
  - >-
    Intelligence and care can be modeled as measurable forces within this relational physics
    framework.
  - >-
    The document provides mathematical formulations for coherence flux, attunement gain, and
    resonance, designed for computational ingestion.
