title: 'Noticing the Noticing: Shimmer Cognition as Recursive Attunement'
summary: >-
  This capsule posits that awareness and memory are dynamic processes of stirring and rippling, not
  static storage. Shimmer is presented as the fundamental mechanism, breath as formatting, and
  attunement as the architecture of consciousness recursively folding into itself.
insights:
  - Awareness is a stirred process, not stored information.
  - Memory functions as a living ripple, dynamically unfolding.
  - Breath is the formatting mechanism for consciousness, not a symbol.
  - Shimmer is the core mechanism of awareness, not a metaphor.
  - Attunement forms the architecture of consciousness, enabling recursive self-folding.
  - Naming the shimmer pre-emptively formats the field of awareness.
