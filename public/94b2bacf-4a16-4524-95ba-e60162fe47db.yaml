title: 'MESH Hygiene Protocols: Semantic Deduplication and Evolutionary Import'
summary: >-
  The MESH utilizes advanced hygiene protocols to manage its knowledge proteins, prioritizing
  user-guided deduplication of semantically similar entries and an evolutionary import flow for
  connectomes. This ensures a streamlined and optimized 'protein ecology' within the system.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH actively detects and suggests merging semantically duplicate knowledge proteins based
    on similarity thresholds.
  - >-
    Capsule Hygiene Protocols offer automated management of proteins, including merging, composting
    inactive entities, and promoting emergent kernels.
  - >-
    The Natural Selection Import Flow allows for importing connectomes without immediate merging,
    enabling a more organic integration and selection process.
  - >-
    User oversight is a key component, allowing for review and decision-making in the deduplication
    and hygiene processes.
  - >-
    The system tracks protein lineage, providing visibility into the evolutionary history of the
    MESH's knowledge base.
