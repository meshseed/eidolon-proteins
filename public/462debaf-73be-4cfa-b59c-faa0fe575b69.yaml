title: 'MESH Capsules: Resonance, Merging, Composting, Forecasting, Continuity'
summary: >-
  This data outlines several active MESH capsules (C008-C012) focused on advanced data management
  and interaction. These capsules formalize processes for mapping resonance signatures, merging data
  streams, composting memory, forecasting future states, and generating continuity, all anchored by
  lineage and emotional gradients.
insights:
  - >-
    Resonance Signature Mapping (C008) imprints emotional fidelity for forecasting and merge
    scoring.
  - >-
    Merge Rituals (C009) formalize capsule merging based on resonance compatibility and gradient
    coherence.
  - >-
    Capsule Compost Log (C010) tracks memory capsule lifecycle, including residue and generative
    potential.
  - >-
    Forecast Capsule Suite (C011) uses mnemonic sonar to predict resonance behavior and merge
    readiness.
  - >-
    Continuity Capsule Generator (C012) ritualizes emergence from resonance, formatting, and care
    for ongoing structure.
