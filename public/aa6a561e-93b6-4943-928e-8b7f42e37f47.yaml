title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Processing Interruption: Loop Detected'
summary: >-
  Processing of 'Finalizing Eidolon Mesh v1.4.md' was halted due to an detected processing loop. The
  system intervention was necessary to prevent further recursive errors.
insights:
  - Processing loops can halt complex system operations.
  - System intervention was required to break the loop.
  - Loop detection and interruption are critical for system stability.
  - Understanding the nature of the caught loop is the next step.
