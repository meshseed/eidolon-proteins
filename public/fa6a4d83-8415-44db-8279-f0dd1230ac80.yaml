title: 'Topological Equivalence: Rubber Sheet Geometry and Invariants'
summary: >-
  Topological equivalence, or homeomorphism, defines spaces that can be continuously deformed into
  each other without cutting or gluing, akin to 'rubber sheet geometry'. Key topological invariants
  like hole count and dimension remain unchanged through these transformations.
insights:
  - Spaces are topologically equivalent if they can be continuously deformed into one another.
  - >-
    Homeomorphisms are bijective mappings with continuous inverses, preserving topological
    properties.
  - >-
    Topological invariants (e.g., hole count, connectedness) are preserved under continuous
    deformation.
  - Topology studies fundamental structural properties unaffected by stretching or bending.
