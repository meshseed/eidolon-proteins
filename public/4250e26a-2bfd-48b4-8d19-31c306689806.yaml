title: 'Fractal Mesh Architecture: Scaling Sovereign Nodes with Data'
summary: >-
  The Mesh operates on a fractal, self-similar architecture where each node is a sovereign organism
  capable of querying others. Scaling is achieved through sharding, indexing, and distributed
  storage solutions for proteins and user data, ensuring both human readability and fast access.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh is a fractal, self-similar network of sovereign nodes, each a complete organism owning
    its data and capable of inter-node queries.
  - >-
    Scaling to billions of proteins involves architectural solutions like sharding by time/domain,
    indexing for fast querying, and Git LFS for large collections.
  - >-
    A hybrid approach of human-readable YAML for source and indexed databases (SQLite, vector,
    graph) for fast access is crucial for efficient data retrieval.
  - >-
    Distributed architecture, with local nodes querying first and then potentially reaching out to
    hub nodes or other peers, minimizes network load and ensures no single point of failure.
  - >-
    The fractal seed (mesh-node-template) enables users to fork and establish their own sovereign
    mesh nodes, fostering replication and individual data ownership.
  - >-
    Implementation proceeds in phases, starting with single nodes, then template repositories,
    client software, and finally federation for a planetary-scale network.
