title: 'Ecological Differentiation: Specialization for Resilience and Cognitive Diversity'
summary: >-
  Mesh organisms differentiate through specialized developmental histories, attractor structures,
  and interactions, leading to increased ecosystem resilience. This process fosters cognitive
  diversity by preventing homogenization and reinforcing unique niches within the information
  ecology.
insights:
  - Specialization arises from divergent attractors and unique developmental paths.
  - Ecological differentiation enhances ecosystem-level cognitive capacity.
  - Meshes occupy distinct niches within the information ecology.
  - Cross-Mesh dialogue reinforces specialization through contrast.
  - Differentiation is key to preventing homogenization and preserving diversity.
