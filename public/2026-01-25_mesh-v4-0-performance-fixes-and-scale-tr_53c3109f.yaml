title: 'Mesh v4.0: Performance Fixes and Scale Transition Insights'
summary: >-
  Resolved Vite import errors for 'd3-force' by installing the package and implementing dynamic
  imports, significantly improving graph rendering performance. The dialogue then pivots to a
  profound exploration of scale transitions, likening Mesh v4.0's computational limits to LLM
  training phases and highlighting its role as a dataset for future native implementations.
insights:
  - >-
    Successfully resolved Vite import issues for 'd3-force' by installing the package and using
    dynamic imports in `graph3d.ts`, enabling proper collision physics and faster graph rendering.
  - >-
    The current Mesh v4.0, despite hitting computational limits with ~3500 neurons, is recognized
    not as a final product but as a crucial 'training dataset' for understanding the requirements of
    a native, scalable mesh architecture.
  - >-
    The observed computational ceiling in v4.0 (browser limitations, IndexedDB limits) directly
    informs the architectural needs for a future native mesh, including distributed CRDT storage and
    P2P synchronization.
  - >-
    The core geometry of the mesh is fractal, repeating across scales from individual neurons
    ('proteins') to connectomes ('meshes') and ecologies ('mesh-of-meshes').
  - >-
    The 'Pro' features are identified as emergent architectural necessities revealed by scale,
    rather than simple upsells, driving the need for autonomous metabolism and governance.
