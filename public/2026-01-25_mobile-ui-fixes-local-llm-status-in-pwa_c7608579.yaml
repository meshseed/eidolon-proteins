title: Mobile UI Fixes & Local LLM Status in PWA
summary: >-
  The PWA's mobile layout was fixed to prevent chat buttons from being obscured by the bottom
  navigation bar, utilizing `100dvh` and extra padding. Local LLM support is confirmed to be
  unimplemented in the current PWA version, with Gemini being the active mobile LLM.
insights:
  - >-
    The mobile UI bug causing chat action buttons to be hidden behind the bottom navigation bar was
    resolved by implementing `100dvh` for the main body height and adding extra padding to the
    conversation actions.
  - >-
    The order of elements in the chat view (Header -> History -> Input -> Actions) was analyzed, and
    the CSS fix addresses potential overflow issues by ensuring the main body correctly accounts for
    viewport height changes.
  - >-
    Local LLM support (WebLLM/Gemma) is explicitly confirmed as not yet implemented in the PWA
    version (v3.5), with Gemini (Flash Lite) serving as the current mobile LLM for performance and
    cost reasons.
  - Local LLM support is planned for future PWA versions (v4.0 or endpoint extension).
  - >-
    The user's request to revert the mobile UI changes and re-introduce a graph view indicates a
    need to re-examine the mobile navigation structure and how the graph is intended to be
    displayed.
  - >-
    The absence of a 'Graph' tab in the mobile top navigation and the conditional hiding of the
    viz-canvas (`.mobile-hidden`) suggest that the graph functionality might be tied to a specific
    mobile navigation tab (potentially 'Network') or is intended for desktop view.
