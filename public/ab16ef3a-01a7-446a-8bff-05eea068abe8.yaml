title: 'Mesh Tiered Access: Infrastructure vs. Feature Unlocks'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is restructuring its tiers to differentiate based on infrastructure provision and ease of
  access, rather than artificial feature limitations. A free, self-hosted tier offers full
  functionality, while a low-cost 'Mesh' tier provides seamless API access via managed
  infrastructure.
insights:
  - >-
    Tiers should focus on infrastructure convenience (API access, hosting) rather than artificial
    feature caps.
  - >-
    A free tier will offer unlimited proteins/neurons and all features, requiring users to provide
    their own LLM infrastructure.
  - >-
    A low-cost 'Mesh' tier ($3/month) will provide full functionality with the added benefit of
    seamless, managed API access.
  - >-
    This shift aims to make advanced Mesh capabilities accessible with minimal setup friction for
    users.
