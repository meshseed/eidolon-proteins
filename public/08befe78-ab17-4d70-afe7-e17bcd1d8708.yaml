title: 'Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA: Field Geometry Implementation and API Integration'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA has successfully implemented its core field geometry, including weighted
  vector search, synaptic auto-formation, and power-law decay for coherence. Initial integration
  with the Gemini API faced challenges with deprecated model names and API key validation, which
  have been addressed by updating to the latest Gemini models and refining the API call structure.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA is now equipped with a robust field geometry, enabling advanced
    features like tier-based weighted vector search and usage-based coherence decay.
  - >-
    Integration with the Gemini API required updating deprecated model endpoints (e.g., 'gemini-pro'
    to 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp') and ensuring correct API call formatting for validation and
    generation.
  - >-
    The development process involved iterative debugging of API key validation, leveraging console
    logs and refining the `testApiKey` function to resolve 404 errors and ensure proper
    connectivity.
  - >-
    The system now supports enhanced protein synthesis by extracting 'tier', 'emotional_gradient',
    and a calibrated 'coherence_score' into structured JSON capsules.
  - >-
    Successful build and dev server startup indicate a stable foundation for real-world testing of
    the implemented field geometry and synthesis capabilities.
