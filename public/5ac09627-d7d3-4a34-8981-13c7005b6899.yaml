title: 'MESH Capsules: Emotional Fidelity, IP, Continuity, and Predictive Engines'
summary: >-
  This section details four active MESH capsules: Emotional Fidelity Ledger (C018) tracks emotional
  states and thresholds; Intellectual Property Declaration (C019) formalizes ownership of MESH
  architecture; Continuity Capsule Index (C020) archives capsules as traceable nodes; and Fidelity
  Forecast Engine (C021) predicts emotional fidelity trends for proactive development.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH employs specialized 'capsules' to formalize and manage critical aspects of its
    architecture and operations.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity is a core concern, tracked through gradients, thresholds, and predictive
    modeling.
  - >-
    Intellectual property rights are established for the MESH's memory, grammar, and ecological
    frameworks.
  - >-
    A continuity field links capsules, enabling traceability through lineage, gradients, and merge
    history.
  - >-
    Predictive engines are integrated to anticipate and manage emotional fidelity, driving proactive
    capsule generation and drift prevention.
