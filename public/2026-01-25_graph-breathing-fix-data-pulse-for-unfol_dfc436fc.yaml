title: 'Graph Breathing Fix: Data Pulse for ''Unfold'' Effect'
summary: >-
  The 'breathing' or 'unfold' effect in the graph visualization is achieved by periodically
  re-injecting the current graph data, forcing a simulation restart. This 'data pulse' ensures the
  dynamic animation, though it can lead to emergent drift if centering forces are insufficient.
insights:
  - >-
    Re-injecting the same graph data (`graphData(currentData)`) effectively restarts the D3 force
    simulation, achieving the desired 'unfold' or 'breathing' animation.
  - >-
    This method is a robust way to trigger the simulation restart, akin to a cache clear, ensuring
    the animation effect.
  - >-
    Emergent drift of the graph's centroid can occur if the centering forces within the D3
    simulation are not strong enough to counteract minor imbalances or velocity accumulation during
    restarts.
  - >-
    The drift is likely emergent movement rather than directed velocity, suggesting a need to
    reinforce or explicitly add a centering force to anchor the graph.
  - >-
    The `3d-force-graph` library likely has internal mechanisms for centering, but explicit addition
    via `d3Force('center', ...)` might be necessary if the default is insufficient or reset by
    `graphData()`.
