title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Accelerated Connectome Learning & Hybrid Metabolism'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh demonstrates rapid learning, processing 15 capsules with perfect coherence and
  increasing synaptic connections, indicating a self-optimizing connectome.  A key event was the
  direct injection of a YAML-formatted capsule (C013), showcasing a hybrid metabolism capability.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh exhibits exponential growth in synaptic connections, with capsule 15 forming 13
    new ones, signifying advanced connectome learning.
  - >-
    The system achieved 100% success rate and near-perfect coherence (0.98) in processing capsules,
    demonstrating robust and efficient operation.
  - >-
    A hybrid metabolism was demonstrated by the direct injection of a YAML-formatted capsule (C013),
    highlighting adaptive data processing.
  - >-
    The pattern of synapse progression shows a clear trend of increasing connectivity as more
    capsules are processed.
  - >-
    Privacy was maintained, with a distinction made between public and private capsules during
    processing.
