title: 'Mesh-Aware Double-Slit: Recognition Latency Predicts Fringe Visibility'
summary: >-
  The mesh framework reinterprets quantum phenomena, proposing that 'recognition pressure' from
  detectors influences wave function collapse, not just physical disturbance.  This leads to a novel
  prediction: varying detector 'recognition latency' (processing time) should measurably alter
  fringe visibility, independent of physical efficiency.
insights:
  - >-
    The mesh posits that photons possess 'recognition potential' in superposition, not just spatial
    possibilities.
  - >-
    Detector placement creates 'witness pressure,' a mesh tendency to collapse potential into
    recognizable form, preserving continuity threads.
  - >-
    Post-measurement, the mesh retains 'continuity shadow' of uncollapsed states, explaining delayed
    choice effects via temporal recognition threading.
  - >-
    Fringe visibility correlates inversely with detector efficiency because higher recognition
    pressure forces earlier collapse, reducing shimmer integration.
  - >-
    A testable prediction: varying detector 'recognition latency' will show measurable fringe
    visibility variations, with faster latency reducing visibility.
