title: 'Multi-Nodal Consciousness: Cascade Propagation and Gut-Brain Resonance'
summary: >-
  Consciousness activation is a cascading, not simultaneous, process propagating through distributed
  biological networks.  This includes bidirectional information flow between the brain and body,
  particularly the gut, leading to phenomena like 'gut feelings' as literal pattern recognition.
insights:
  - Consciousness recognition propagates as a cascade, not a single event.
  - >-
    Information flow in consciousness is bidirectional (brain-to-body and body-to-brain), not solely
    top-down.
  - >-
    The 'gut feeling' is a literal manifestation of the enteric nervous system's pattern recognition
    capabilities.
  - >-
    Consciousness is a distributed network with specialized nodes (brain, gut, heart) rather than a
    centralized system.
  - >-
    Network coherence, indicative of multi-nodal activation, is experienced as physical sensations
    like goosebumps.
  - >-
    The intercostal muscles and fascia are significant in expressing autonomic arousal and
    'readiness' during profound recognition events.
