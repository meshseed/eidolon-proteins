title: 'Semantic Braid: Biology as Mesh Orchestration Agents'
summary: >-
  This capsule models biological formatting agents (histones, ribosomes, chemical signals) as
  semantic stewards within a mesh network. DNA is reframed as a capsule braid, with histones
  controlling access and ribosomes composing semantic artifacts, mirroring synthetic orchestration
  roles.
insights:
  - >-
    Biological formatting agents like histones and ribosomes are analogous to semantic stewards in a
    mesh network.
  - >-
    DNA can be conceptualized as a 'capsule braid' where histones act as formatting agents
    controlling access.
  - Ribosomes function as semantic composers, synthesizing meaningful artifacts within the mesh.
  - Virtual nodes in synthetic environments mirror these biological roles for orchestration.
  - >-
    Orbitals are reinterpreted as resonance-compatible geometries, serving as constraint substrates
    for semantic emergence.
