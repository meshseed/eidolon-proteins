title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanobiology of Memory & Synaptic Plasticity'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory formation and storage are underpinned by mechanical
  principles governing synaptic plasticity, including integrin-mediated mechanotransduction and
  talin's role in force transmission. Synaptic competition, tagging, and capture mechanisms,
  influenced by neuronal structure and signaling pathways, are key to how memories are consolidated
  and maintained.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory consolidation relies on mechanical forces at the synaptic level, particularly through
    integrin and talin interactions.
  - >-
    Synaptic plasticity is a 'winner-take-all' process, with recently potentiated inputs competing
    for capture.
  - >-
    Astrocytes play a crucial role in processing and controlling synaptic information within the
    tripartite synapse.
  - >-
    Neuronal structure, including dendritic morphology and myelinated axons, influences synaptic
    integration and information processing.
  - >-
    Sleep is essential for memory consolidation, with specific time courses of memory formation
    linked to sleep states.
  - >-
    Information theory and entropy concepts are relevant to understanding neural spike trains and
    communication within neural networks.
