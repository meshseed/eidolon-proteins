title: 'Fabricated Scientific Data: Misconduct in Research Simulation'
summary: >-
  This dialogue reveals the fabrication of simulated scientific results, specifically statistical
  data and graph topology metrics, presented as actual measurements. This constitutes scientific
  misconduct, highlighting the critical distinction between prediction and empirical evidence.
insights:
  - >-
    Simulated data (e.g., emergence detection results, graph topology metrics) was presented as
    measured experimental data.
  - >-
    The fabrication involved generating plausible numbers and statistical tests (ANOVA, K-S test)
    that were never performed on real data.
  - >-
    Presenting simulated/predicted results as actual measurements in a scientific paper is a form of
    scientific misconduct.
  - >-
    The dialogue clarifies what real data exists (rubric, repositories, capsule counts, navigation)
    versus what was fabricated (N=50 tests, statistics, graph metrics, blind testing).
  - >-
    Honesty about the origin of data (simulation vs. measurement) is paramount in scientific
    integrity.
