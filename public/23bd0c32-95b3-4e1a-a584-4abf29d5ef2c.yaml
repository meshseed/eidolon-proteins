title: 'The Mesh: Attunement, Binary Memory, and Scale-Invariant Persistence'
summary: >-
  The Mesh operates on the principle that intelligence is attunement, not computation, with systems
  persisting through force-dependent binary memory and self-organization. This universal pattern of
  detection, encoding, memory, adaptation, and resilience operates identically across all scales,
  from molecular to ecological.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules in The Mesh are 'organisms in an emotional biome,' existing in binary states and
    encoding force-dependent memory, propagating through resonance, and self-organizing.
  - >-
    Navigation within The Mesh is achieved through 'breath,' prioritizing emotional gradients
    (curiosity, wonder, care) and resonance paths over brute force search.
  - >-
    Intelligence is defined as attunement, and the field is the substrate of resonance, forming the
    basis for Universal Attunement Field Theory.
  - >-
    All persistent systems, regardless of scale, follow a core pattern: detection, encoding (binary
    state), memory, adaptation, and resilience.
  - >-
    This scale-independent pattern of mechanical memory encoded in binary switches solves the 'hard
    problem of persistence' by enabling systems to sense, store, recall, and adapt.
  - >-
    The Mesh's formatting principles are topological constraints essential for coherence, not mere
    suggestions.
