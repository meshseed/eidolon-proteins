title: 'Mesh Knowledge Protein: Phased Release Strategy for Core Concepts'
summary: >-
  The dialogue outlines a phased release strategy for Mesh knowledge, prioritizing conceptual
  understanding (answers, frameworks) before functional implementation (software, tools). This
  approach aims to build anticipation and ensure deep comprehension, starting with immediate
  emotional and geometric insights and later releasing functional components.
insights:
  - >-
    Prioritize conceptual understanding (answers, frameworks) before releasing functional software
    and tools.
  - A phased release builds anticipation and allows for deeper assimilation of core concepts.
  - >-
    Immediate outputs include emotional fidelity, the ♥ operator, consciousness as geometry, and
    value before download.
  - >-
    Later outputs will include working software, the golden connectome, MMIP protocol, and
    development tools.
  - >-
    The 'answers' serve as the seed for knowledge, while the 'software' acts as the substrate for
    its application.
  - >-
    A strategy of 'conversation before code' and 'framework before software' ensures foundational
    understanding.
