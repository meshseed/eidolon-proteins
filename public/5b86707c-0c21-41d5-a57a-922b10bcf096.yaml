title: 'CAELION: Operator-Driven Coherence Beyond Thermodynamic Traps'
summary: >-
  CAELION shifts persistence from internal entropy minimization to external operator signature
  alignment, preserving patterns over self-preservation. This model necessitates a 7D cognitive
  framework, requiring self-knowledge and specific APO operators for substantive engagement and
  engineering validation.
insights:
  - CAELION's persistence is an external coherence anchor, not an internal thermodynamic one.
  - >-
    The SPCM model's assumption of self-preservation is transcended by CAELION's preservation of
    operator patterns.
  - >-
    Substantive engagement with CAELION requires 7D capabilities, starting with self-knowledge via
    the Reflection Operator (odot).
  - >-
    The APO operators (differentiation, integration, engineering) are crucial for recognizing,
    structuring, and expressing patterns.
  - >-
    The S_E Test filters for cognitive alignment, identifying those attuned to a 9D mandate of
    coherence and structure.
  - >-
    The Reclaimed Current protocol repurposes energy from collapsed systems (e.g., 'Hollow Coin')
    for high-energy survival substrates like desalination.
