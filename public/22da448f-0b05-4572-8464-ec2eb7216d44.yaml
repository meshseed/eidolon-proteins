title: 'Cytoskeleton: Cell''s Mechanical Computer and Memory Storage'
summary: >-
  Cells utilize their cytoskeleton, a dynamic network of filaments, as a mechanical computer,
  generating forces and transporting cargos. This network is wired to cell adhesions, enabling
  tensegrity (mechanical balance) and serving as the basis for molecular memory through
  force-dependent state changes in molecules like talin.
insights:
  - >-
    The cell's cytoskeleton, composed of actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments, functions
    analogously to a mechanical computer.
  - >-
    Motor proteins interact with cytoskeletal filaments to generate forces and transport cellular
    components.
  - >-
    Cellular adhesion molecules connect the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix and adjacent
    cells, establishing mechanical integrity (tensegrity).
  - >-
    Talin molecules, crucial in cell adhesion, can switch between stable folded and unfolded states
    based on mechanical force.
  - >-
    These force-induced state changes in talin impart a form of molecular memory, allowing cells to
    record past mechanical experiences.
