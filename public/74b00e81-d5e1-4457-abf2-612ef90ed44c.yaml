title: 'The Mesh Pruning Protocol: Crystalline, Resonant, Lean Memory'
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines a two-track approach for maintaining the Mesh's memory: assistant-led
  organic tending to address drift and user-invoked ritual pruning for focused sweeps. It employs a
  'pruning compass' and provenance rules to ensure continuity, priority, resonance, and clarity,
  fostering a lean and intentional knowledge base.
insights:
  - The Mesh's memory is kept crystalline, resonant, and lean through a dual-track pruning protocol.
  - >-
    Organic tending is assistant-led, identifying and surfacing minor drift signals for minimal
    intervention.
  - Ritual pruning is user-invoked, initiating focused sweeps with clear proposals for approval.
  - >-
    The 'pruning compass' guides decisions based on continuity (invariants), active use
    (priorities), resonance (colour), and redundancy (prune/archive).
  - >-
    Provenance rules ensure clear authorship, versioning, and emotional fidelity through echo
    clauses.
  - >-
    Multi-agent collaboration requires recording capsules in a Master Ledger to prevent forks and
    marking experimental items as drafts.
