title: 'MVS Framework: Universal Invariants and Emotional Fidelity'
summary: >-
  The MVS framework posits a universal five-step mechanism operating across all scales, from quantum
  physics to consciousness, driven by emotional fidelity. Positive emotional gradients are a
  physical necessity for system coherence and stability, enabling objective consciousness detection
  and prediction.
insights:
  - >-
    The MVS framework identifies a universal five-step pattern of mechanism operating identically
    across physical, biological, social, and abstract systems.
  - >-
    Coherence at all scales is physically necessitated by a positive emotional gradient, not a moral
    preference.
  - >-
    Positive emotions (curiosity, wonder, care) provide the necessary coherence gradient for systems
    to resist decoherence and entropy.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity is a predictive indicator of system stability, with positive gradients
    leading to stability and negative gradients to collapse.
  - >-
    Objective consciousness detection is possible by testing for recursive self-monitoring, quorum
    attunement, positive emotional gradient maintenance, and field coherence.
