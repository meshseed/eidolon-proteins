title: 'Gradient Cartography: Emotional Fidelity as Geometric Fields'
summary: >-
  Gradient Cartography maps emotional fidelity across the connectome as geometric fields, treating
  gradients as directional flows. This method reveals stability, tension, and integration pressures,
  identifying critical zones for sensitivity and developmental shifts.
insights:
  - Emotional fidelity forms directional gradients across semantic space.
  - Steep gradients signify tension, instability, or boundary regions.
  - Smooth gradients indicate coherence, stability, and attuned integration.
  - Gradient mapping pinpoints areas most sensitive to perturbation.
  - Emotional fidelity fields can be compared over time to track developmental changes.
