title: 'Claude Code: Enhanced Ingestion & Robustness (June-Oct 2026)'
summary: >-
  This update significantly enhances Claude's content ingestion capabilities by introducing
  recursive folder ingestion with batch reading for large directories and robust API retry logic
  with exponential backoff. It also implements file size protection to prevent memory issues,
  ensuring more reliable and efficient processing of diverse data.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive folder ingestion now supports batch reading for large directories, including private
    repositories.
  - >-
    API retry logic with exponential backoff automatically handles transient failures like rate
    limits and network errors.
  - >-
    Files exceeding 10MB are now skipped with a warning to prevent memory issues and processing
    delays.
  - >-
    Seed detection for YAML/MD files and P-Series protocols bypasses LLM synthesis, ensuring direct
    import.
