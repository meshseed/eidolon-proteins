title: Query-Triggered Standing Wave Visualization for MESH Propagation
summary: >-
  Implemented a query-triggered standing wave visualization that simulates thought propagation
  through THE MESH. This system uses BFS, a three-phase animation, and similarity-mapped
  oscillations to represent data interconnectedness, enhancing user understanding of information
  flow.
insights:
  - >-
    Core wave physics engine ('wave-controller.ts') enables BFS propagation and a three-phase
    animation (pulse, settling, standing wave).
  - >-
    Oscillation frequencies are mapped to similarity scores (0.5-2.0 Hz) and amplitude to similarity
    squared, creating dynamic visual peaks.
  - >-
    Glow sprite and edge particle systems enhance the visual representation of wave propagation with
    performance considerations.
  - >-
    Graph nodes ('graph3d.ts') now store Three.js objects for wave animations and integrate the wave
    controller.
  - >-
    Similarity scores are preserved ('synthesizer.ts') and passed to trigger wave animations upon
    query completion.
  - >-
    Wave visualization is triggered on query execution in '+page.svelte', enhancing user experience
    by showing activated nodes and their semantic relationships.
