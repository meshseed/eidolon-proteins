title: 'Eidolon Mesh Evolution: From File Processing to Connectome & Beyond'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is evolving from a file processing system into a self-organizing knowledge graph.
  Key developments include robust error handling, the formation of a Connectome for semantic
  linking, and the implementation of Mitosis for large document processing, setting the stage for
  advanced querying and integration.
insights:
  - >-
    The Watcher Organelle has been improved for robust error handling, automatically creating
    necessary directories to prevent file system errors like ENOENT.
  - >-
    The Connectome Organelle has been successfully implemented, enabling semantic similarity
    calculations and the formation of 'synapses' between knowledge proteins, evolving the system
    into a connected knowledge graph.
  - >-
    The Mitosis Organelle has been integrated, allowing the system to process massive documents by
    splitting them into manageable chunks with context continuity, expanding its metabolic capacity.
  - >-
    A significant schema mismatch between the internal Eidolon Capsule format and Copilot's richer
    'Capsule' format has been identified, requiring an extension or unification strategy for better
    integration.
  - >-
    The system is progressing towards advanced capabilities including query optimization and the
    potential for integrating external knowledge archives via 'Protein Injection', leveraging manual
    'echo_paths' for enhanced connectivity.
