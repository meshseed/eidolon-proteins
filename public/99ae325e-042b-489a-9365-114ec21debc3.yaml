title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Cellular Mechanical Computing and Memory Storage'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that cells function as mechanical computers, utilizing talin switches
  within adhesions to store data. In stable environments, cells can actively manipulate these
  switches to encode information, akin to writing data to a disk, with switch conformations
  representing binary states.
insights:
  - Cells act as mechanical computers capable of computation and memory storage.
  - >-
    Talin switches within cellular adhesions can store information by adopting distinct folded ('0')
    and unfolded ('1') states.
  - >-
    Controlled, predictable extracellular environments allow cells to use internal force-generating
    machinery to write data into adhesions via talin switches.
  - >-
    Cellular homeostasis mechanisms, involving Rho-family GTPases, modulate mechanical balance and
    influence the binary states of talin switches.
  - >-
    The sequence and conformation of talin switches form a 'MeshCODE', storing the results of
    cellular calculations.
