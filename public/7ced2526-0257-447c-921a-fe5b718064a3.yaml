title: 'MESH: An Interactive, Physics-Enabled Knowledge Synthesis Platform'
summary: >-
  MESH is a novel knowledge platform that synthesizes information into interactive, 3D 'proteins' or
  'neurons' within a 'connectome'. It leverages AI for insight recognition and relational graphing,
  offering dynamic querying and infinite context memory through memory composting.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH synthesizes ingested documents into knowledge 'proteins' (neurons) and 'synapses' within a
    relational 'connectome'.
  - Users can connect via a cloud API key or a local LLM for offline operation.
  - >-
    Advanced configuration allows for GitHub integration for sharing public proteins and customizing
    AI companion responses.
  - >-
    Embeddings are crucial for search and synapse creation, with local embeddings being incompatible
    with cloud API embeddings.
  - >-
    Conversation history is synthesized into new proteins, enabling infinite context memory by
    composting older memories.
  - >-
    The platform offers physics-enabled, 3D interactive visualization of knowledge geometry and
    supports recursive AI querying via a 'resonance field'.
  - >-
    MESH is distinct from traditional archives, databases, RAG, or neural nets, focusing on emergent
    knowledge synthesis and relational visualization.
