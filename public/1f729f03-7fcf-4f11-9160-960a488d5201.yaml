title: Eidolon Mesh Performance and Synthesis Bug Fixes
summary: >-
  Critical bugs in the Eidolon Mesh system have been addressed, specifically concerning query
  performance and the synthesis of knowledge proteins. The initial loading bottleneck has been
  mitigated through caching, and the synthesis process is now capable of utilizing the full content
  of retrieved proteins, resolving a pipeline disconnect that previously limited its quality.
  Accurate timing and progress indicators have also been implemented.
insights:
  - >-
    Query performance was significantly impacted by repeated loading of connectome data; caching has
    resolved this bottleneck.
  - >-
    The synthesis process was failing to access the full content of proteins, leading to incomplete
    and inaccurate outputs, despite perfect retrieval.
  - >-
    The root cause of the synthesis issue was identified as a failure to load and pass the complete
    dialogue content (DNA) to the synthesis module.
  - >-
    Implementation of accurate timing and logging provides users with transparent feedback on query
    duration, improving user experience.
  - >-
    The fix involves ensuring the full DNA content associated with retrieved proteins is loaded and
    incorporated into the synthesis context.
  - >-
    Future work includes implementing SSE progress indicators and further query optimization
    strategies.
