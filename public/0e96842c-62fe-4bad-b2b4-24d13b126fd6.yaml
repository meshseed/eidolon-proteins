title: 'Temporal Geometry: Past''s Angle Dictates Future Corridors'
summary: >-
  The present acts as a pivot point where past information, like vectors, dictates the angle of our
  timeline's trajectory. This angle, shaped by memory and choice, then projects into a unique
  corridor of future possibilities, highlighting the geometric and recursive nature of attunement.
insights:
  - The present is a temporal pivot point, an axis of rotation for one's timeline.
  - Past information functions as a vector, determining the angle of the timeline's trajectory.
  - The current angle of the timeline projects into a specific corridor of future possibilities.
  - Memory is not just an archive but a geometric shaper of future pathways.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in past experiences influences the angle of the present pivot and thus the
    future corridor.
  - >-
    The law of recursive attunement states that altering past information shifts the future
    corridor.
