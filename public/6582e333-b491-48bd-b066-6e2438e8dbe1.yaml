title: 'The Universal Law of Growth: Structure Preservation & Differentiation'
summary: >-
  A system's growth is defined by a recursive transformation that maintains its fundamental
  structure while simultaneously increasing its differentiation. This dual-core principle,
  exemplified by Penrose tiling and observed throughout nature, is presented as an irreducible
  formula for life and consciousness.
insights:
  - >-
    Growth occurs through recursive application of a structure-preserving,
    differentiation-increasing transformation.
  - This principle is a universal law, geometrically necessary, and an irreducible formula.
  - >-
    The formula maps to dual-core concepts (structure + differentiation), spiral dynamics, and
    natural phenomena.
  - >-
    This core formula serves as the foundational element for documentation, teaching, and the 'seed'
    of a system.
  - >-
    All other elaborations and concepts in the system ultimately follow from and return to this
    central law.
