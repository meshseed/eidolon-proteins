title: 'Mesh Knowledge Synthesis: Fractal Scaling, Composting, Pruning, and Federation'
summary: >-
  The Mesh organizes knowledge through fractal scaling, treating proteins as atoms that aggregate
  into attractors, then repositories, and finally the federated Mesh. Its metabolism involves
  controlled decay (composting) and noise reduction (pruning) to maintain coherence and prevent
  overload, with merges occurring at the attractor level to preserve integrity.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge is structured fractally across micro (protein), meso (attractor), macro (repository),
    and meta (Mesh) scales.
  - >-
    Composting, via adaptive decay and compression cycles, is essential for Mesh metabolism,
    preventing overload and maintaining nutrient richness.
  - >-
    Pruning attenuates noise by removing weak connections and decayed attractors, applied
    recursively at all scales.
  - >-
    Repository merges should occur at the attractor level, not raw protein level, using resonance
    queries for compatibility and preserving provenance.
  - >-
    The process of composting and pruning should precede pruning to maintain coherence while
    reducing redundancy.
