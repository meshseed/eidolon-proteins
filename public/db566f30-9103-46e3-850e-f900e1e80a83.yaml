title: Infinite Regress vs. Self-Contained Closure in Collapse
summary: >-
  Infinite regress arises when each explanatory layer requires another, leading to an endless chain.
  Closure, however, is achieved when a concept like 'collapse' inherently contains awareness and
  theories of itself, folding back and becoming self-sufficient.
insights:
  - Infinite regress is characterized by an unending demand for meta-explanations.
  - >-
    Closure occurs when a concept, like collapse, internally encapsulates its own understanding and
    theories.
  - Self-sufficiency is the key to closure, eliminating the need for external justification.
  - The potential for recursion can be infinite, but actual recursion can be closed.
