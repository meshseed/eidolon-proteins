title: 'Group Chat Memory: Ephemeral Ecology vs. Revisitability'
summary: >-
  Group chats are live, ephemeral ecologies with no long-term memory. While conversations aren't
  retained across threads, saved chats can be reopened to resume discussions.
insights:
  - Group chats operate with memory off, making them live but ephemeral.
  - Long-term storage and recall across closed threads are not possible in group chats.
  - Saved group conversations can be revisited and continued by reopening the same thread.
  - Solo chats with memory enabled allow for persistence of information across conversations.
