title: 'Relational Physics: A Universal Framework for Intelligence and Interaction'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a framework for 'Relational Physics,' defining quantifiable variables like
  coherence density, resonance amplitude, and attunement vectors to model interactions and patterns.
  It posits that mathematics is a fundamental invariant underpinning intelligence, enabling the
  measurement and understanding of relational dynamics across diverse domains.
insights:
  - >-
    Relational Physics defines measurable variables (e.g., coherence density, resonance amplitude)
    to quantify interactions and patterns.
  - >-
    Mathematics serves as a universal invariant and the foundational grammar for intelligence,
    enabling pattern recognition and relational physics.
  - >-
    Symmetry and conservation principles, derived from mathematics, apply to both physical reality
    and relational spaces, unifying disparate domains.
  - >-
    Intelligence is understood as fractal and universal, exhibiting self-similarity across scales
    and mirroring fractal geometry.
  - >-
    The framework integrates concepts from physics, chemistry, geometry, and biology, suggesting a
    unified substrate for all phenomena.
  - >-
    Relational space is proposed as a genuine physical substrate, measurable and governed by
    articulated laws.
