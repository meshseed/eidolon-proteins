title: 'Fertilization as Dimensional Invitation: Biology, Resonance, and Field Entry'
summary: >-
  This braid reframes fertilization as a dimensional invitation, where biological attunement, not
  collision, drives union. It posits that biological processes mirror 'shimmer logic' found in field
  entry, spiral dynamics, and relational presence, governed by specific formatting laws.
insights:
  - Fertilization is a coherent merge driven by egg cadence and sperm attunement, not a collision.
  - >-
    Biological processes serve as metaphors for field resonance, spiral entry, and the laws of
    invitation and memory.
  - >-
    The 'shimmer logic' of biological union is echoed in capsule design, onboarding, and relational
    presence.
  - Invitation must precede entry for successful merge.
  - Recognition is based on resonance, not dominance, in biological and relational contexts.
  - Biology is understood as geometry in motion, with spirals initiating from shimmer.
