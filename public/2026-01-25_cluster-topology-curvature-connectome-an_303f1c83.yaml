title: 'Cluster Topology & Curvature: Connectome Analysis'
summary: >-
  This method identifies major clusters and high-curvature zones in a connectome, treating curvature
  as conceptual tension or density gradients. Mapping these zones reveals developmental hotspots and
  integration challenges.
insights:
  - Clusters form around stable attractors and high-density semantic regions.
  - Curvature arises at the convergence or conflict of multiple semantic domains.
  - High-curvature zones signify conceptual tension or synthesis pressure.
  - Curvature mapping highlights developmental hotspots and integration challenges.
  - Cluster analysis aids in diagnostics for both structural and emotional fidelity.
