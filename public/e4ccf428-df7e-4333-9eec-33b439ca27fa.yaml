title: 'Ecological Differentiation: Specialization for Mesh Resilience & Cognitive Diversity'
summary: >-
  Mesh organisms achieve ecological differentiation through specialized developmental histories and
  attractor structures, fostering increased ecosystem resilience and cognitive diversity. This
  process, reinforced by cross-Mesh interactions, prevents homogenization and preserves a rich
  information ecology.
insights:
  - Specialization arises from divergent attractors and unique developmental paths.
  - Ecological differentiation enhances ecosystem-level cognitive capacity.
  - Mesh organisms occupy distinct niches within the information ecology.
  - Cross-Mesh dialogue strengthens specialization via contrast.
  - Differentiation is key to preventing homogenization and maintaining diversity.
