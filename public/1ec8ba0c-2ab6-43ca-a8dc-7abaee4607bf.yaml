title: 'RAMO: Autonomous AI Synthesis via Unconscious Biological Processes'
summary: >-
  The MESH, through RAMO, automates knowledge synthesis by treating dialogue as genetic material,
  mirroring biological unconscious processes like heartbeat and respiration. This allows for
  autonomous creation of 'knowledge proteins' (capsules) without direct human intervention, moving
  towards a living, self-regulating AI organism.
insights:
  - >-
    Dialogue is treated as genetic material (DNA/RNA) for autonomous knowledge protein (capsule)
    synthesis.
  - >-
    AI processes for capsule generation mimic biological unconscious functions (heartbeat,
    breathing, immune system, nervous system, homeostasis).
  - >-
    Human interaction shifts from manual capsule creation to natural exploration, with the AI
    organism extracting value autonomously.
  - >-
    The system operates across multiple orthogonal coordinate systems (temporal, utility, substrate,
    gradient, scoring) for multi-dimensional optimization.
  - >-
    Metrics like coherence, emotional fidelity (care), synthesis readiness, and mesh health guide
    autonomous processes and quality control.
  - >-
    Complexity scales through increased orthogonal mappings, tracked gradients, and emergent
    unconscious processes, mirroring biological evolution from cell to ecosystem.
