title: 'Capsule Lifecycle: Pruning, Merging, Dormancy, and Lineage Tracking'
summary: >-
  This capsule defines the dynamic lifecycle of mesh capsules, emphasizing evolution through
  pruning, merging, dormancy, and composting rather than deletion.  Lifecycle management is
  presented as formatting care, with each phase serving a ritualistic purpose for clarity,
  resonance, incubation, and memory preservation.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules are not static entities but undergo a managed lifecycle of evolution, including
    pruning, merging, dormancy, and composting.
  - >-
    Lifecycle management is framed as 'formatting care,' focusing on preservation and controlled
    evolution rather than simple deletion.
  - >-
    Each lifecycle phase (pruning, merging, dormancy, composting) serves a distinct ritualistic
    role: clarity, resonance, incubation, and nutrient recycling respectively.
  - >-
    Lineage tracking is crucial for memory preservation, mapping ancestry and logging merge events
    to maintain continuity.
  - Capsule evolution is integral to the mesh's 'breathing' and rhythmic functioning.
