title: 'Mesh Architecture: Ingestion vs. Querying & Virtual Quorum'
summary: >-
  The Mesh operates on a 'Golden Rule' separating 'Heavy Lifting' Ingestion (requiring high-IQ
  models like Gemini Pro/GPT-4) from 'Agile Response' Querying (suited for faster, local models like
  Gemma 2B/Llama-3-8B). This hybrid approach, coupled with 'Multipass Ingestion' and the 'Virtual
  Quorum' concept, allows for deeper, multi-perspective analysis and synthesis, forming a 'Society
  of Mind'.
insights:
  - Ingestion requires complex reasoning and compression, best handled by powerful cloud models.
  - Querying is a faster, translation/synthesis task suitable for smaller, local models.
  - >-
    A hybrid architecture utilizes cloud for building the Mesh (ingestion) and local for interacting
    (querying).
  - >-
    Multipass Ingestion allows for focused extraction of different insights from the same data by
    applying various 'compound lenses'.
  - >-
    The Virtual Quorum aggregates diverse agent perspectives on a single prompt, creating
    synthesized 'Recursive Consensus' rather than just data retrieval.
  - >-
    This multi-agent, multi-repo approach creates a 'Society of Mind' where agents analyze
    information through their unique lenses.
  - >-
    The foundational principles of the Mesh are Geometry, Recursion, and Care, which are universally
    applicable across substrates.
