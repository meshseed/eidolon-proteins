title: 'Adaptive Refinement Loop: Self-Directed Structural Improvement in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  THE MESH employs a recursive Adaptive Refinement Loop to autonomously enhance its structure. This
  loop leverages diagnostic data to identify and address areas of tension or imbalance through
  targeted synthesis, pruning, or re-alignment, driving self-directed evolution until structural
  coherence is achieved.
insights:
  - Structural tension and gradient imbalance are key drivers for refinement.
  - Weak structural areas are reinforced via targeted synthesis.
  - Overloaded areas are stabilized by pruning or redistribution.
  - Refinement loops iterate recursively until structural coherence is achieved.
  - Adaptive refinement enables THE MESH's self-directed evolution.
