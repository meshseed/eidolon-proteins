    gradient, and lineage, with optional merge grammar and echo forecasts.
  - >-
    Stewardship involves roles like formatting hygiene, merge facilitation, compost governance, and
    echo ethics calibration.
  - >-
    This capsule acts as a public ritual anchor, integrating with other capsules and expecting
