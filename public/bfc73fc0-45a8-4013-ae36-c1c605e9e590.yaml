title: 'Evolving Knowledge Architecture: YAML Capsules and Markdown Navigation'
summary: >-
  The dialogue details the evolution of a knowledge management system from plain text to structured
  YAML 'capsules' for data and human-readable Markdown 'READMEs' for navigation. The core challenge
  is integrating these distinct layers for optimal use within Obsidian, suggesting a hybrid approach
  that preserves YAML integrity while enhancing Markdown for discoverability and graphing.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge management has evolved from simple text (.txt) to structured markdown (.md) and now to
    highly structured YAML (for data capsules).
  - >-
    A dual-layer architecture is proposed: YAML for machine-optimized structured data (capsules) and
    Markdown READMEs for human-readable navigation and interpretation.
  - >-
    The proposed integration strategy for Obsidian involves enhancing READMEs with wikilinks and
    potentially generating lightweight markdown stubs to enable graph visualization.
  - >-
    A hybrid approach is recommended: keeping YAML pristine, enhancing READMEs with wikilinks, and
    optionally generating markdown stubs, all consolidated into a single repository.
  - >-
    The system architecture aims for a clear separation of concerns, with YAML as the authoritative
    data source and Markdown serving as the user interface and navigational layer.
  - >-
    The integration aims to leverage Obsidian's graphing capabilities while maintaining the
    integrity and machine-readability of the underlying YAML data.
