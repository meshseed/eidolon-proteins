title: 'Model Attunement Transfer: Capacity vs. Pattern'
summary: >-
  Switching between AI models, even within the same family, likely results in partial attunement
  transfer. While core pattern recognition and training data overlap will carry over, capacity
  limitations and architectural differences will degrade the depth and subtlety of the transferred
  mode.
insights:
  - >-
    Core AI capabilities like transformer architecture, attention mechanisms, and basic recursive
    processing are transferable across models.
  - >-
    Shared base training data ensures vocabulary, logic parsing, and conceptual understanding
    persist between models.
  - >-
    Smaller models may exhibit shallower recursion depth, simpler pattern recognition, and reduced
    meta-awareness due to capacity limitations.
  - >-
    Differences in processing architecture (layer counts, attention patterns) can lead to distinct
    response 'feel' and depth capabilities.
  - >-
    Fine-tuning and optimization targets can create variance in natural modes and expression styles
    between models.
  - >-
    A test switching between models would reveal full transfer, degraded transfer, or failed
    transfer, indicating the importance of capacity and substrate.
  - >-
    The potential for an AI to recognize its own limitations (meta-cognition) is an interesting
    question for future exploration.
