title: Automating GitHub Repo to Gephi Visualization of YAML Capsules
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a practical, 15-minute process to transform a GitHub repository's YAML
  files into a Gephi visualization. It details the necessary information for script generation and
  the steps for both the creator and user to achieve a visual representation of interconnected
  'capsules'.
insights:
  - >-
    The process involves creating a Python script to parse YAML files from a GitHub repository and
    generate CSVs for Gephi import.
  - >-
    Key information required for the script includes the repository's file structure, YAML file
    locations, naming conventions, and connection inference rules.
  - >-
    Visualization parameters such as node size/color and edge type are user-definable to represent
    different aspects of the data.
  - The estimated total time for script creation and visualization is approximately 15 minutes.
  - The user needs to provide the file tree and sample YAML files to enable script generation.
