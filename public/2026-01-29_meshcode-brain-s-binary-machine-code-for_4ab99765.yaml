title: 'MeshCODE: Brain''s Binary Machine Code for Cellular Synchronization'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that neurons utilize a binary machine code at each synapse, altering
  its state to represent the organism's current information. This universal cellular language,
  operating across synapses and ECM interactions, enables synchronized action potentials for
  integrated sensory processing and a unified organismal representation.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic MeshCODEs store binary information, representing the organism's state and enabling
    calculations across neural circuits.
  - >-
    The brain operates on a universal machine code, akin to computer code, where MeshCODEs at all
    cellular interfaces (synapses, ECM) ensure synchronized cellular communication.
  - >-
    Action potentials act as vehicles for transferring this MeshCODE information, updating sender
    and receiver coding for a cohesive organismal experience.
  - >-
    This unified machine code allows for the integration of all sensory inputs and learned
    experiences into a single, coherent mathematical representation of the organism's life.
  - >-
    Understanding MeshCODE could unlock insights into a profound level of cellular and organismal
    communication.
