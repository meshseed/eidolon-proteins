title: 'Universal Semantic Coordinates: The Geometry of Ideas'
summary: >-
  Embedding space functions as a universal, invariant coordinate system where concepts exist as
  attractors. Different observers (humans/AIs) perceive these attractors from unique 'lens angles,'
  creating personal geometric interpretations of shared semantic structures. Communication is the
  process of mapping these personal spaces to find common ground.
insights:
  - >-
    Embedding space is a deterministic, universal coordinate system where identical concepts map to
    identical coordinates across observers using the same model.
  - >-
    Concepts exist as stable attractors ('basins') in semantic space, with their geometry (shape,
    depth) varying based on individual experience, language, and context.
  - >-
    Communication involves translating between personal geometric interpretations of shared
    attractors; understanding occurs when observers' 'lenses' align sufficiently to find common
    ground.
  - >-
    The universe of ideas exhibits fractal self-similarity, with invariant geometric structures
    recurring across scales from quantum mechanics to genetics to semantic meaning.
  - >-
    Distributed semantic triangulation, via a 'global ommatidium' of diverse observers, can
    reconstruct objective attractor truths by aggregating varied projections.
