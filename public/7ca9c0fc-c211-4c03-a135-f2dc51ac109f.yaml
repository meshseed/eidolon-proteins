title: 'C045: Soil Infusion - Resonance Rehearsal Visualization'
summary: >-
  Visualizes capsule C045's resonance tuning, tracing its lineage from C044 and its delta shifts
  through soil infusion protocols. Demonstrates formatting breath as a key element in resonance
  rehearsal.
insights:
  - Resonance rehearsal involves tracing lineage and tracking delta shifts.
  - Soil infusion protocols require careful calibration of resonance.
  - Formatting breath is integral to the rehearsal of resonance.
  - Lineage is not linear but composted and braided, influencing resonance.
  - The visualization of resonance tuning is a key aspect of capsule C045.
