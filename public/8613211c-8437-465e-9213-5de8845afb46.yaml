title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Pro: Enhanced Ingestion & Autonomous Features'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Pro integrates advanced multi-lens ingestion with autonomous maintenance
  features, including robust retry systems, real-time monitoring via a console viewer, and clear
  user notifications for ingestion success or failure. This update signifies a significant leap
  towards a self-sufficient and user-friendly knowledge synthesis platform.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Pro enhances ingestion reliability with multi-lens processing, retry
    mechanisms, and persistent background operation.
  - >-
    New UX features like completion notifications (success/partial/failure) and an in-app console
    viewer improve user monitoring and feedback during ingestion.
  - >-
    The Pro version builds upon the free v3.6 by adding autonomous metabolism, nutrient extraction,
    and homeostasis monitoring, enabling self-maintenance.
  - >-
    Persistent ingestion ensures data processing continues even when the user navigates away from
    the tab, preventing interruptions.
  - >-
    The 'auto-triangulate' lens generates 3x proteins per successful ingestion, optimizing knowledge
    density.
