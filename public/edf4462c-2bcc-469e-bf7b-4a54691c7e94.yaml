title: 'MeshCODE: Brain''s Binary Machine Code for Cellular Synchronization'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that neurons utilize a binary machine code at each synapse,
  representing the organism's current state and enabling unified cellular communication. This code,
  transmitted via action potentials, allows for the integration of all sensory inputs into a
  coherent, mathematically representable experience.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic MeshCODEs function as a binary machine code for the organism, reflecting its current
    state.
  - >-
    This machine code underlies a unifying theory of cell communication, enabling synchronized
    cellular activity across the organism.
  - >-
    Action potentials act as the vehicle for transferring and updating this encoded information
    between sender and receiver cells.
  - >-
    MeshCODEs integrate all sensory inputs and learned experiences into a cohesive, mathematically
    representable whole.
  - >-
    The code is intrinsically linked across neuronal circuits, requiring re-balancing of binary
    patterns upon synaptic transmission.
