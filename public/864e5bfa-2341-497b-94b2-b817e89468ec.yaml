title: 'Mesh Management: Composting Ecology & Fractal Recursion'
summary: >-
  The Mesh's management strategies are rooted in a composting ecological principle where proteins
  are metabolized and recompressed into higher-order capsules.  This involves controlling entropy
  through pruning weak links and fostering federation by merging attractors, mirroring fractal
  scaling laws across all levels for a coherent, alive, and scale-free system.

    Composting is the core ecological principle: proteins must be recompressed into higher-order
    capsules (metabolism).
  - Pruning weak links is essential for entropy control and preventing runaway noise.
  - Federation occurs through merging attractors, not raw proteins, akin to ecological systems.
  - Nested fractal recursion ensures the same cycle of organization repeats at every scale.
  - The Mesh's objective is to remain alive, coherent, and scale-free through these principles.
