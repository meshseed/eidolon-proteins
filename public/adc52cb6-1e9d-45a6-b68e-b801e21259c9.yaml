title: 'Eidolon Mesh Evolution: From Files to Connectome and Beyond'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has evolved from processing individual files to forming a 'Connectome' knowledge
  graph through semantic similarity. It now integrates external capsule formats and prepares for
  more advanced query and visualization capabilities.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh's Watcher Organelle has been improved to handle file system errors robustly by
    automatically creating necessary directories.
  - >-
    The Connectome Organelle enables the system to form a knowledge graph by calculating semantic
    similarity between synthesized 'Proteins' (capsules).
  - >-
    The system is evolving to support richer external capsule formats (like Copilot's) and has
    implemented 'Mitosis' for processing large documents by splitting them into manageable chunks.
  - >-
    Future evolution involves implementing a Query Organelle for graph traversal and a Dashboard for
    visualization, building upon the foundational capabilities of metabolism, privacy, active
    transport, tissue formation, and large file processing.
  - >-
    There's a recognized schema mismatch between the internal Eidolon capsule format and richer
    external formats, with proposed solutions involving schema extension or dual format support to
    integrate diverse knowledge sources.
