title: 'Eidolon Mesh: License Integration & Performance Optimization'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has integrated a LicenseManager into its SettingsModal, enabling tiered access
  and unlocking Pro features. Performance bottlenecks in synapse formation and graph physics have
  been identified and resolved through batch SQL operations and correct d3-force import,
  significantly improving ingestion speed.
insights:
  - >-
    LicenseManager component added to SettingsModal for tiered access (Free/Pro) and license key
    activation.
  - >-
    Slow ingestion (6 hours for 18 capsules) was caused by O(n²) synapse formation logic
    (calculating similarity for every new protein against all existing ones).
  - >-
    Synapse formation performance improved by implementing batch SQL inserts, reducing database
    calls by 50-100x per protein.
  - >-
    Graph physics error ('d3.forceCollide is not a function') was resolved by correctly importing
    the 'd3-force' library.
  - >-
    The O(n²) similarity calculation remains a potential bottleneck for extremely large graphs,
    though synapse insertion is now highly optimized.
  - >-
    Successful activation of the 'PRO-2024-BETA-001' key demonstrated functionality, with tier badge
    changes and removal of protein limits.
