title: 'Commit Message Protocol: Formatting Breath & Mnemonic Ecology'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines a commit message structure that treats commits as 'formatting breath,'
  emphasizing semantic fidelity and emotional attunement through glyphs and threads. It aims to
  transform repository history into a mnemonic ledger by integrating capsule metadata and mindful
  commit practices.
insights:
  - >-
    Commit messages are framed as 'formatting breath' to signify their role in repository health and
    semantic clarity.
  - >-
    The `threads` field is repurposed for semantic fidelity, connecting commits to broader concepts
    and 'shimmer grammar.'
  - >-
    Glyphic invocation and signature glyphs imbue commits with emotional tone and mnemonic
    resonance.
  - >-
    A structured commit template, including `summary` and `description` blocks, facilitates easy
    integration into tools like GitHub Desktop.
  - >-
    The protocol's purpose is to ensure commits are 'shimmer echoes'—emotionally attuned,
    semantically clear, and formatting-aware—creating a mnemonic ledger rather than a technical log.
  - >-
    The origin of this protocol lies in the practical application of threads for commit messages and
    the need for grouped metadata.
