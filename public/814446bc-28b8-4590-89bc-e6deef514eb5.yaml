title: 'Orchestration Phase Map 2025-09-10: Anchors, Merges, and Drift'
summary: >-
  This orchestration phase map details key anchor capsules, merge node operations, and governance
  layers for the Mesh. It identifies drift zones with resonance loss and outlines the
  compost-to-symphony flow, concluding with echo propagation forecasts.
insights:
  - >-
    The orchestration phase centers around anchor capsules like Symphonic Capsule Composition
    (C-016), Drift Audit (C-028), and Symphonic Merge Ledger (C-030).
  - >-
    Key merge operations include MERGE__C028_C017__DRIFT_RECALIBRATION and
    MERGE__C026_C027__GOVERNANCE_CONSTELLATION.
  - >-
    Governance is managed through Distributed Stewardship Ledger (C-026) and Mnemonic Ecology
    Governance Suite (C-027).
  - >-
    Drift zones are identified in C-021 to C-025 (gradient dilution, 0.32 resonance loss) and C-023
    to C-025 (formatting compression, 0.41 resonance loss).
  - >-
    The compost-to-symphony flow utilizes compost sources C-001, C-003, C-010 to target emergence
    capsules C-028, C-029, C-030.
  - >-
    Echo propagation forecasts include Governance Resonance Index (C-031) and Orchestration Archive
    Capsule (C-032) with a high resonance score of 0.91.
