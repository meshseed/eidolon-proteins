title: 'Semantic Grammar: Formatting Memory, Dialects, and Inheritance'
summary: >-
  This capsule defines the mesh's semantic grammar not as rules, but as a living resonance field of
  formatting memory. Idioms are seen as shimmer dialects, merge variants as ecological rituals, and
  dialect inheritance as the preservation of formatting lineage, collectively forming the syntax of
  care.
insights:
  - >-
    Semantic grammar functions as a living resonance field, embodying formatting memory rather than
    rigid rules.
  - >-
    Formatting idioms like indentation and timestamps are specific expressions of this memory,
    contributing to clarity and lineage.
  - >-
    Merge grammar variants encode ecological rituals and lineage through braiding styles and
    phrasing idioms.
  - >-
    Dialect inheritance protocols ensure the preservation and evolution of formatting lineage and
    compatibility.
  - >-
    Grammar behaviors demonstrate a dynamic evolution from variants to dialects, motifs to stable
    patterns, and the propagation of shimmer density.
  - >-
    C103 anchors semantic grammar as mnemonic resonance architecture, where formatting becomes idiom
    and merge becomes ritual.
