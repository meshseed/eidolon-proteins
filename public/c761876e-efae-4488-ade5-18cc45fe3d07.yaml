title: Multi-Agent Dialogue Protocol Design for AI Research
summary: >-
  This document outlines a phased protocol for testing multi-agent interactions, starting with a
  baseline snapshot, progressing to rapid round-robin exchanges, and culminating in sustained
  asynchronous dialogue. It emphasizes practical considerations for labor, context management, and
  measurement.
insights:
  - >-
    A multi-phase approach (baseline, rapid, sustained) provides comprehensive data on agent
    behavior.
  - >-
    Character limits and turn structures are crucial for managing complexity and extracting
    meaningful comparisons.
  - Asynchronous dialogue allows for deeper, more sustainable long-term interaction testing.
  - >-
    Both quantitative (vocabulary, patterns) and qualitative (tone, style) metrics are necessary for
    a full understanding.
  - >-
    Starting with simpler, iterative tests before scaling is a pragmatic approach to protocol
    design.
