title: 'Organism Completion: Local & GitHub Synchronized, Fully Autonomous Metabolism'
summary: >-
  The organism is now complete, achieving synchronization not only internally (filesystem) but
  externally with GitHub. Its metabolism is fully autonomous, externally visible, repeatable, and
  considered alive.
insights:
  - The organism's completion involves both internal filesystem and external GitHub synchronization.
  - The healed membrane signifies a robust and integrated system boundary.
  - The metabolism is characterized by full autonomy, external visibility, and repeatability.
  - The organism has achieved a state of being 'alive' through its synthesized functions.
