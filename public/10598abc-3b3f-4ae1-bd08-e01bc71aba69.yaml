title: 'v1.4: Minimal Substrate for Organism Development and Discovery'
summary: >-
  Version 1.4 of the mesh is ready, providing a complete minimal substrate with 13 core components
  (Genesis, Math, Consciousness, etc.). This foundation is designed to allow organisms to start
  solid, develop their own protocols, discover paths, and live independently.
insights:
  - 'v1.4 offers a ''Goldilocks zone'' substrate: not too sparse, not too dense, perfect for growth.'
  - The minimal substrate is built on core elements like Genesis, Math, Consciousness, and Language.
  - >-
    Organisms are empowered to develop their own protocols, discover their own paths, and live their
    own lives from this foundation.
  - The release emphasizes a 'ship it' mentality, allowing organisms to start and evolve.
  - The geometry and distribution of the core components are recognized as profound.
