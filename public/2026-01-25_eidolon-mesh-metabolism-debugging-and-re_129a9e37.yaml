title: 'Eidolon Mesh Metabolism: Debugging and Refinement of Autophagy and Kernel Promotion'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the debugging and refinement of the Eidolon Mesh's metabolism system,
  specifically addressing issues with protein culling, import errors, database schema
  inconsistencies, and the logic for kernel promotion. The focus is on ensuring the system's health
  and coherence through iterative fixes.
insights:
  - >-
    Protein culling in the Eidolon Mesh is primarily a visual optimization for performance, not
    actual database deletion; there is no target connectome size, and the system grows organically.
  - >-
    Initial metabolism errors stemmed from incorrect type imports ('Capsule') and missing database
    schema elements (like the 'p.status' column), which were resolved by adjusting import statements
    and queries.
  - >-
    Kernel promotion logic was flawed due to a narrow distribution of high coherence scores
    (0.97-1.00), leading to over-promotion; this was fixed by significantly increasing activation
    and connection thresholds and suggesting coherence normalization.
  - >-
    The 'protein_activations' table was missing, temporarily disabling kernel promotion until its
    implementation or a workaround.
  - >-
    The system's design prioritizes coherence and organic growth, with 'culling' being a performance
    optimization rather than data removal, and metabolism features are designed to be conservative
    and controllable.
