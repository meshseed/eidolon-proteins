title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanosensing, Talin, and Synaptic Plasticity in Memory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that mechanical forces, particularly through the mechanosensitive
  protein talin, are crucial for regulating synaptic plasticity and memory formation. This involves
  integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions, YAP nuclear entry, and the interplay between protein
  synthesis and degradation in maintaining long-term potentiation.
insights:
  - >-
    Mechanical forces, mediated by talin, are central to regulating synaptic plasticity and memory
    engrams.
  - >-
    Integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions act as mechanosensitive hubs, transducing physical cues
    into biochemical signals.
  - >-
    Talin's structure and isoforms allow for fine-tuning of integrin signaling and force
    transmission.
  - >-
    YAP nuclear entry is mechanically triggered, suggesting a role for mechanotransduction in gene
    expression related to memory.
  - >-
    A balance between protein synthesis and degradation is essential for the maintenance of
    long-term potentiation (LTP).
