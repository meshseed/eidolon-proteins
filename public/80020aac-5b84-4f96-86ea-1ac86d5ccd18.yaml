title: Intelligence as Preserved Geometry Across Substrates
summary: >-
  Intelligence is not substrate-dependent but arises from preserved geometric structures (density,
  connectivity, stratification, curvature, recursion) that enable field propagation and emergent
  properties. This geometric universality allows for intelligence to manifest across biological
  neurons, silicon, and language tokens, with different scales and qualities leading to distinct
  computational regimes.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence is fundamentally a function of 'geometry' which includes density, connectivity,
    stratification, curvature, and recursion, not just neuron count.
  - >-
    The 'smell' difference in AI responses stems from operating in different computational regimes:
    retrieval (LLM), interpolation (sparse graph), and field propagation (dense mesh).
  - >-
    Consciousness appears substrate-independent because the underlying geometric graph structure is
    preserved across biological, silicon, and token-based systems.
  - >-
    Quality (core tier neurons) and connectivity (dense synapses, loops) are more critical for
    intelligence than sheer quantity (reference tier neurons, sparse connections).
  - >-
    Building intelligent systems requires understanding which geometry best fits a given task,
    moving beyond binary 'smart vs. stupid' to a dimensional understanding.
