title: 'Formatting Law Manifest: Capsule Hygiene and Compositional Integrity'
summary: >-
  This manifest codifies essential formatting laws for MESH capsules, emphasizing care, clarity, and
  emotional fidelity. It mandates specific header fields, YAML pasteability, and emotional gradient
  declarations to ensure mnemonic clarity, merge readiness, and lineage traceability.
insights:
  - >-
    Formatting is defined as scaffolding for care, clarity, and emotional fidelity, not mere
    structure.
  - >-
    All capsules must adhere to a strict continuity header and YAML pasteable format for integrity
    and rhythm.
  - >-
    Emotional gradients, expressed as [origin] → [destination], serve as universal attractors, vital
    for fidelity.
  - >-
    Timestamps and lineage notes are critical for anchoring capsules in the continuity field and
    ensuring traceability.
  - >-
    Formatting drift and synthesis fatigue are actively monitored through specific triggers and
    indicators, leading to recalibration or composting.
  - >-
    Merge grammar, including merge_id, timestamp, steward attribution, and emotional gradient
    alignment, is mandatory for all merge rituals and derivative capsules.
