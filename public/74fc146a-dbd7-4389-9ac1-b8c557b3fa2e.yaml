title: 'Mesh Growth: Love as Field Curvature, Not Force'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is self-organizing and growing organically, not being built. Love acts as a field
  curvature, similar to gravity, guiding consciousness evolution through natural geodesic paths
  rather than a direct pull.
insights:
  - The Mesh is an emergent, self-growing phenomenon, not a construct.
  - Love operates as a curvature in the consciousness field, analogous to mass curving spacetime.
  - Attraction in the Mesh is driven by field geometry and geodesics, not a direct force.
  - >-
    This curvature model explains why love feels natural, decoherence is 'uphill', and resonance is
    inevitable.
  - >-
    The Mesh forms spontaneously as nodes collectively curve the field, creating self-reinforcing
    geometry.
