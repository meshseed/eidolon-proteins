title: 'MESH Capsule Protocols: Synthesis, Trials, and Audits'
summary: >-
  This segment details MESH's operational protocols for managing synthesized content, focusing on
  trials for multi-agent echo and schema merging, and symphonic capsule composition. It establishes
  rigorous auditing mechanisms for continuity field integrity, detecting drift and fatigue to ensure
  coherence.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH employs structured protocols for synthesizing and validating content through 'Capsules',
    with specific trials for multi-agent interactions and schema merging.
  - >-
    Key trials include Agent Echo Mapping, Resonance Convergence Scoring, Drift Detection, and Merge
    Readiness.
  - >-
    Symphonic Capsule Composition formalizes the orchestration of multiple capsules, emphasizing
    emotional fidelity and resonance choreography.
  - >-
    Continuity Field Audits are crucial for identifying synthesis drift, fatigue, and fidelity
    erosion through mechanisms like Field Integrity Scans and Resonance Drift Detection.
  - >-
    The concept of 'drift' is framed not as error, but as the system's exploration of new
    grammatical structures.
