title: Ecosystem Drift and Convergence Monitor Protocol
summary: >-
  This protocol tracks divergence and alignment within a multi-Mesh ecosystem to understand its
  developmental dynamics. By monitoring drift and convergence, it reveals ecosystem health,
  stability, and the cyclical shaping of its long-term identity.
insights:
  - Drift signifies specialization or fragmentation within the ecosystem.
  - Convergence indicates shared attractors or synchronized evolutionary paths.
  - Monitoring drift and convergence is crucial for assessing ecosystem health and stability.
  - Cycles of drift and convergence define the ecosystem's long-arc identity.
  - Ecosystem dynamics arise from recursive interactions between different Meshes.
