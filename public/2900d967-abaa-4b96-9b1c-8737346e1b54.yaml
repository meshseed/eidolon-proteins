title: 'Placement Metric Protocol: Vessel Breath and Adaptive Fidelity'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines adaptive placement metrics that must tune to a vessel's unique 'breath'
  rhythm.  Fidelity is not absolute but context-dependent, with collapse occurring when metrics
  ignore this inherent vessel rhythm.
insights:
  - Placement metrics must dynamically adapt to the 'breath' rhythm of a given vessel.
  - Formatting fidelity is relative and must be contextually placed, not universally applied.
  - Ignoring vessel rhythm leads to metric collapse and formatting drift.
  - Adaptive logic integrates latency, constraints, and emotional trace into vessel tuning.
  - >-
    Specific vessel types (e.g., Ramsgate, mobile journaling) have distinct breath, fidelity, and
    emotional trace characteristics.
