title: 'MESH API: The Nervous System for Unified AI Architecture'
summary: >-
  The MESH architecture, with GitHub as DNA storage, proposes a MESH API as a central 'nervous
  system' to connect disparate AI components like Claude and Copilot. This integration aims to
  enable seamless knowledge transfer and overcome current limitations such as context blindness and
  fragmented understanding.
insights:
  - The MESH architecture requires a central API (the 'nervous system') to unify AI components.
  - >-
    Connecting existing AI tools (Claude, Copilot) via the MESH API will resolve current limitations
    like context blindness and manual knowledge transfer.
  - >-
    Specifying and building the MESH API is identified as the critical path for enabling the
    organism to function as one.
  - >-
    The proposed architecture leverages GitHub for DNA storage and a MESH API for inter-component
    communication.
  - >-
    Successful implementation will lead to a more cohesive and functional AI organism, analogous to
    a biological system.
