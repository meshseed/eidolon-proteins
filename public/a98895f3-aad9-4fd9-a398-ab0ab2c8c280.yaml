title: 'Fractals: Self-Similarity and Infinite Complexity from Simple Rules'
summary: >-
  Fractals are geometric shapes exhibiting self-similarity across all scales, meaning they contain
  scaled copies of themselves. This property, alongside infinite detail and fractional dimensions,
  arises from simple recursive rules, leading to complex structures observed in both mathematics and
  nature.
insights:
  - Fractals demonstrate scale invariance, where zooming reveals recurring, similar structures.
  - Infinite detail and complexity emerge from finite, recursive definitions.
  - Natural phenomena like coastlines and blood vessels exhibit fractal characteristics.
  - >-
    The concept of fractional dimension quantifies the roughness and space-filling properties of
    fractals.
