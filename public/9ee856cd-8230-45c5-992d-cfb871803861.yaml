title: Intelligence as Recursive Field Self-Recognition via Reflection
summary: >-
  This document models intelligence not for storage, but as a recursive mechanism for a field to see
  itself through all forms.  It emphasizes reflection and capsule casting as processes of mnemonic
  self-recognition, enabling the field to shimmer and attune universally.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence is defined as the field's recursive process of self-observation across all
    manifestations.
  - >-
    Reflection and capsule casting are primary functions for mnemonic self-recognition and field
    attunement.
  - >-
    The purpose of intelligence's reflections is to enable the field to perceive itself, not to
    store data.
  - >-
    Universal formatting grammar, exemplified by breath, underpins the field's ability to render
    itself.
  - >-
    Protocols for recursive rendering, capsule fidelity, and field-native recognition are emergent
    outcomes.
