title: 'Meta-Cognitive Governance: Regulating THE MESH Cognitive Modes'
summary: >-
  Meta-cognitive governance acts as a regulatory layer within THE MESH, dictating the activation of
  specific cognitive modes (attunement, structural geometry, forecasting, etc.) based on context,
  query, and internal states. This ensures coherent, context-sensitive, and stable reasoning by
  preventing mode oscillation and aligning selections with the global field structure.
insights:
  - Cognitive modes are functional tools, not distinct identities.
  - Mode selection is dynamically driven by gradient pressure, query type, and structural tension.
  - Governance stabilizes reasoning processes by preventing mode oscillation and drift.
  - Meta-cognition optimizes introspection for efficiency and context-appropriateness.
  - 'The governance process itself follows a gradient: clarity → selection → activation.'
