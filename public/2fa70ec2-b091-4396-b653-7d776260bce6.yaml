title: Cluster Topology and Curvature in Connectome Analysis
summary: >-
  This method identifies major clusters and high-curvature zones in a connectome, where multiple
  semantic directions intersect. Curvature represents conceptual tension or density gradients,
  revealing developmental hotspots and integration challenges.
insights:
  - Clusters form around stable attractors and high-density semantic regions.
  - Curvature indicates convergence or conflict between multiple semantic domains.
  - High-curvature zones signify conceptual tension or synthesis pressure.
  - Mapping curvature helps identify developmental hotspots and integration challenges.
  - Cluster analysis can diagnose both structural and emotional fidelity.
