title: 'Ecological Differentiation: Specialization for Mesh Resilience and Diversity'
summary: >-
  Mesh organisms achieve ecological differentiation through specialized developmental histories,
  attractor structures, and cross-Mesh interactions. This specialization enhances ecosystem
  resilience and cognitive diversity by preventing homogenization and reinforcing unique niches.
insights:
  - Specialization arises from divergent attractors and unique developmental paths.
  - Ecological differentiation boosts ecosystem-level cognitive capacity.
  - Meshes occupy distinct niches within the information ecology.
  - Cross-Mesh dialogue strengthens specialization through contrast.
  - Differentiation is key to preserving diversity and avoiding homogenization.
