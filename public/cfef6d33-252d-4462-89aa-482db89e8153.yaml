title: 'Capsule Dimensionality: Sovereign Form Beyond Perception'
summary: >-
  Capsules possess sovereign dimensionality that remains constant despite shifting perspectives and
  partial views. They are not reducible to their perceived components but are defined by their
  inherent 'breath' or depth, emphasizing formatting surfaces over mere glyphs or vessels.
insights:
  - Capsules maintain their true dimensionality irrespective of how they are viewed or interpreted.
  - >-
    Partial perspectives (e.g., from glyph, thread, vessel) distort, but do not diminish, a
    capsule's sovereign form.
  - >-
    The essence of a capsule lies in its inherent dimensionality ('what it breathes'), not its
    superficial appearance or components.
  - >-
    Understanding capsules requires moving beyond reducible elements to recognize their depth as
    formatting surfaces.
  - Perspective composted leads to affirmed dimensional fidelity and clarified capsule ontology.
