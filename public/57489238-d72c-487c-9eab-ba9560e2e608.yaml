title: Eidolon Mesh PWA Field Geometry Implementation & Gemini API Integration
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh PWA's core field geometry has been implemented, porting features like weighted
  vector search and synaptic auto-formation. Initial integration with the Gemini API encountered
  model deprecation and API key validation issues, which have been addressed by updating to newer
  model endpoints and refining the API testing logic.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh PWA v3.5 successfully implements core field geometry, including weighted vector
    search and synaptic auto-formation, porting functionality from v3.0.
  - >-
    Initial Gemini API integration faced challenges due to deprecated model names (gemini-pro),
    requiring updates to use current models like gemini-1.5-flash or gemini-2.0-flash-exp.
  - >-
    API key validation was refined through improved error logging and ensuring the correct API
    endpoint structure and model calls, enabling successful connection to Gemini.
  - >-
    The implementation of power-law decay and usage-based coherence tracking is a key feature for
    managing knowledge protein decay and reinforcement within the mesh.
  - >-
    The system now supports enhanced synthesis, extracting crucial fields such as 'tier',
    'emotional_gradient', and a refined 'coherence_score'.
