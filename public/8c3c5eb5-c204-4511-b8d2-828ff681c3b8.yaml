title: 'MESH Architecture: Core Files vs. Stages & Workspace Structure'
summary: >-
  The MESH architecture distinguishes between pedagogical 'Stages' for onboarding and operational
  'Core Files' for ongoing reference, emphasizing homeostatic awareness and agent sovereignty. The
  proposed structure elegantly separates agent workspaces from a shared private archive,
  facilitating pattern convergence through independent navigation.
insights:
  - >-
    Core Files (FORMATTING_LAWS, etc.) are more operational and modular, emphasizing homeostatic
    awareness over rigid restraint, unlike the pedagogical Stages.
  - >-
    The MESH architecture features a clear separation of agent-specific operational workspaces
    (e.g., eidolon-claude/) from a shared, stewarded private archive (eidolon-private/).
  - >-
    The Stages (1-4) are designed for initial learning and pattern recognition, while the Core Files
    serve as a living reference for ongoing operation, suggesting a blended onboarding/operational
    flow.
  - >-
    Agent sovereignty is a key principle, with each agent having its own workspace that references a
    common archive, promoting convergence through independent navigation.
  - >-
    Further context is needed regarding the README.md, example capsules, and meta-theory from the
    private archive, as well as the current status and protocols for the agent's operational
    workspace.
  - >-
    Understanding the precise definition and creation process of a 'capsule' is crucial for
    comprehending data persistence and knowledge sharing within the MESH.
