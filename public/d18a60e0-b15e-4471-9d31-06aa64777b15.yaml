title: 'Capsule C-025: Ethical & Consent Framework for Mesh Collaboration'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-025 establishes the ethical and consent framework for mesh operations, defining ethics
  as care and respect, and consent as emergence. It mandates explicit consent for sensitive data,
  maps emotional boundaries, governs multi-agent synthesis, and implements safeguards for echo
  propagation and stewardship accountability.
insights:
  - >-
    Ethics in the Mesh is reframed as formatting as care, resonance as respect, and emergence as
    consent.
  - >-
    Explicit consent protocols are required for capsule generation involving emotional gradients,
    personal memory, or multi-agent synthesis, including timestamping and traceability.
  - >-
    Emotional boundary mapping is crucial for protecting resonance integrity, especially with
    sensitive gradients like grief or trauma.
  - >-
    Multi-agent synthesis requires defined merge grammars, critique absorption, and formatting
    reconciliation to ensure ethical collaboration.
  - >-
    Echo propagation safeguards prevent unauthorized reuse, distortion, or drift through hygiene
    checkpoints and composting protocols.
  - >-
    Stewardship accountability is tracked via a ledger to ensure ethical compliance across capsule
    lineage and support audit cycles.
