title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Signals Shape Synaptic Memory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that neuronal synapses act as signaling hubs, translating mechanical
  signals into altered protein conformations ('switches'). This dynamic switching controls synaptic
  transmission probability and can create 'tags' for long-term potentiation, forming a mechanical
  basis for memory.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic contractility generates mechanical signals that alter protein switch patterns within
    the synapse.
  - Ligand binding to different switch states reads the mechanical code, defining synaptic output.
  - >-
    Transient activation/deactivation of synapses is regulated by dynamic changes in talin switch
    conformation.
  - >-
    Mechanical signaling can update the probability of synapse firing, contributing to homeostatic
    scaling.
  - >-
    Stimulated synapses exhibit localized contractility, creating unique 'tags' that recruit
    proteins for long-term potentiation.
