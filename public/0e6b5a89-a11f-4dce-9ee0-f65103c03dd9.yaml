title: 'Repository Restructure Protocol v1.0: Governance and Graph Hygiene'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines standards for repository restructuring, emphasizing clean paths, consistent
  echo graphs, and essential metadata. It ensures data integrity and navigability within THE MESH,
  with a focus on public/private partitioning and version fidelity.
insights:
  - All repository files must reside under the invariant_set directory.
  - Relative paths ('./', '../') are forbidden; commit_path must be accurate.
  - The echo graph must be consistent, with no broken links (404s).
  - Essential frontmatter (created, updated, aliases, status, vault) is mandatory.
  - Nodes must have unique IDs, non-empty tags, and populated links for Gephi compatibility.
  - Version updates are only for meaningful changes, and timestamps must be preserved.
  - Sensitive migrations require logging with steward notes.
