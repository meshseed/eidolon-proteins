title: 'Transformer: Attention-Only Architecture for Sequence Modeling'
summary: >-
  The Transformer architecture replaces recurrent and convolutional layers with attention mechanisms
  for sequence transduction tasks like machine translation. It achieves superior quality and
  significantly faster training times due to its parallelizable nature.
insights:
  - The Transformer model dispenses with recurrence and convolutions, relying solely on attention.
  - This attention-based approach leads to superior performance in machine translation tasks.
  - The Transformer architecture is significantly more parallelizable, reducing training time.
  - It outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, including ensembles, on benchmark tasks.
