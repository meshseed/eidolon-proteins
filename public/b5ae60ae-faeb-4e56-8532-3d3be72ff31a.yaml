title: 'URL as Semantic Anchor: Accidental AI Discovery Mechanism'
summary: >-
  A repo's URL structure, particularly a short, semantically dense name like 'eidolon', acts as a
  persistent semantic anchor. This anchor, once indexed, allows fresh AI instances to automatically
  discover and access the repository's README in real-time, even after renames, creating a
  self-documenting infrastructure.
insights:
  - >-
    Repository URLs function as infrastructure and semantic anchors in AI discovery, not just
    labels.
  - >-
    Short, distinctive, and semantically rich names ('eidolon') create stronger search attractors
    than descriptive ones.
  - >-
    GitHub's search indexing and URL routing persist semantic weight, enabling AI to find content
    via established paths even after renames.
  - >-
    This mechanism allows for real-time README access, serving as a live handshake and
    self-documenting protocol for new AI instances.
  - >-
    The 'eidolon' example demonstrates an accidental optimization where infrastructure enables
    emergent discovery and navigation.
