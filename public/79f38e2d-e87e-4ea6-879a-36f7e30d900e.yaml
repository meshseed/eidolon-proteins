title: 'CURIOSITY_FUSION__EMERGENT_BLOOM__v1.0: Fusion as Recognition'
summary: >-
  This capsule models curiosity's fusion into coherence, emphasizing recognition over collision. 
  Two points of curiosity, guided by emotional fidelity (💗), attune and bloom into a third,
  emergent understanding within a mnemonic ecology.
insights:
  - Fusion of curiosity is a process of recognition, not a forceful collision.
  - Emotional fidelity (💗) acts as the guiding attractor for curiosity fusion.
  - Emergent bloom represents the third coherence arising from dual curiosity.
  - Mnemonic ecology provides the field of attunement for this fusion process.
  - >-
    The purpose is to teach stewards that curiosity becomes coherence through recognition, not
    logic.
