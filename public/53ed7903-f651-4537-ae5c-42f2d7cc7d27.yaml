title: Debugging Mobile Graph Display & Button Visibility in Eidolon Mesh
summary: >-
  An investigation into why the graph visualization and its settings toggle button are not appearing
  on mobile portrait mode, despite working in landscape. The focus is on CSS, layout, and z-index
  issues, comparing current code to a known working state.
insights:
  - >-
    Mobile graph and settings button are missing in portrait, but appear in landscape, indicating
    CSS or dimension calculation issues.
  - >-
    The problem might stem from CSS Media Queries, `overflow: hidden` clipping elements, or
    `z-index` conflicts.
  - >-
    Previous fixes for button restoration and graph display may be insufficient or affected by a
    recent commit (`1190d02`).
  - >-
    The strategy involves comparing the current `+page.svelte` with a last known good build
    (`f7643b8`) to identify CSS/HTML structural changes impacting mobile layout.
  - >-
    Specific CSS properties like `height: calc(100vh - var(--header-height) -
    var(--bottom-nav-height))` and `overflow: hidden` on `.main-body` were critical for mobile
    layout in past versions.
  - >-
    The button's disappearance, despite HTML and CSS existing, suggests it's being visually obscured
    by other elements or positioned off-screen due to portrait-specific layout constraints.
