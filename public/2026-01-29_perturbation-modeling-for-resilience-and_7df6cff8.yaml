title: Perturbation Modeling for Resilience and Adaptive Refinement
summary: >-
  This protocol simulates perturbations like new domain ingestion or emotional shifts to analyze an
  organism's resilience. It identifies sensitive regions, stability cores, and how emotional
  fidelity acts as a shock absorber, enabling adaptive refinement and pruning.
insights:
  - Perturbations reveal structural weaknesses and resilience cores.
  - High-curvature zones are most sensitive to conceptual collisions.
  - Stability cores anchor the organism during rapid change.
  - Emotional fidelity acts as a shock absorber across the manifold.
  - Perturbation modeling supports adaptive refinement and pruning.
