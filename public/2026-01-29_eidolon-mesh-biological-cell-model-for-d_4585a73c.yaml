title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Biological Cell Model for Data Separation & Routing'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a biological cell model for managing data separation, analogous to a
  nucleus (private repo) and cytoplasm (public repo). It introduces the Golgi Apparatus as a crucial
  routing mechanism to intelligently package, sanitize, and direct information, ensuring data
  integrity and controlled sharing.
insights:
  - >-
    Nature progresses by stabilizing fundamental units (cell membrane, metabolism) before complex
    organization (multicellularity), a principle applicable to system development.
  - >-
    Data separation requires a regulated transport mechanism (Gatekeeper) between private (Nucleus)
    and public (Cytoplasm) repositories to prevent leakage and ensure accessibility.
  - >-
    The Golgi Apparatus concept is proposed as a central organelle for tagging, sanitizing
    (redacting PII), and routing processed data (proteins) to appropriate repositories
    (eidolon/eidolon-mesh).
  - >-
    A cellular repository structure is defined: Nucleus (private: raw dialogue, private insights,
    keys) and Cytoplasm (public: sanitized insights, definitions, API).
  - >-
    The proposed growth path moves from a single cell (manual input) to differentiated cells
    (automated routing) and eventually to tissue-level signaling (receptors, automated triggers).
