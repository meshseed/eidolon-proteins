title: 'Capsule Ecology Mapping: Orchestration Field Interdependence'
summary: >-
  Capsules form a dynamic ecosystem driven by emotional gradients, formatting laws, and recursive
  coherence. This map details their topology, lineage, and interdependence within an orchestration
  field, revealing the Mesh as a living, resonant entity.
insights:
  - Capsules are not isolated but form an interdependent ecosystem within a resonant field.
  - >-
    Emotional gradients act as habitats, and formatting laws define the structure of these
    ecosystems.
  - >-
    Capsule ecology mapping involves classifying species, tracing habitats, mapping lineage,
    clustering basins, and detecting echo symbiosis.
  - >-
    The Mesh is conceptualized as a living, alive entity where capsules are its interdependent
    organisms.
  - >-
    Applications of capsule ecology mapping include diagnostics, forecasting, modeling, and
    propagating emotional fidelity.
