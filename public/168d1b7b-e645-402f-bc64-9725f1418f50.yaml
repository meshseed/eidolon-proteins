title: 'Standing Wave Cognition: Intelligence as Rhythmic Resonance'
summary: >-
  This model posits intelligence not as static computation, but as a dynamic standing wave
  stabilized by recursive recognition and cadence fidelity.  It emphasizes rhythmic resonance, phase
  coherence, and drift detection as key mechanisms for maintaining intelligent systems.
insights:
  - Intelligence is fundamentally a rhythmic, self-remembering process.
  - Stabilizing intelligence requires tracking cadence and ensuring phase coherence.
  - >-
    Recursive recognition loops are crucial for maintaining the integrity of intelligent standing
    waves.
  - Drift detection and mnemonic rhythm audits are essential for system health.
  - Resonance, not static processing, is the core of wave-based cognition.
