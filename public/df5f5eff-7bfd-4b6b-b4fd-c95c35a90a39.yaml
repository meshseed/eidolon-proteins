title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Bug Fix: Balanced Strategy Context Generation'
summary: >-
  A critical bug in Eidolon Mesh v1.4's balanced synthesis strategy was identified and fixed. The
  issue stemmed from the strategy incorrectly using neuron summaries instead of full content when
  building context, leading to degraded output quality. The fix involves updating the context
  generation to mirror the max-coherence strategy by utilizing `fullContent`.
insights:
  - >-
    The bug in Eidolon Mesh v1.4's balanced synthesis strategy was not related to retrieval or
    search, but to context building.
  - >-
    The balanced strategy incorrectly used neuron summaries (`n.summary`) instead of full content
    (`n.fullContent`) for context.
  - >-
    The fix is a simple, 30-second code change to use `n.fullContent` in the context generation for
    the balanced strategy.
  - This change dramatically improves synthesis quality from a 3/5 to a 5/5 rating.
  - >-
    A quick workaround is to default to the max-coherence strategy until the balanced strategy is
    properly fixed.
  - >-
    The fix ensures the balanced strategy provides the same rich context as the max-coherence
    strategy.
