title: 'MESH Synthesis: Antigravity''s Architecture & Connectome Implementation'
summary: >-
  Antigravity has provided a comprehensive MESH scaling architecture, including quality control,
  tending protocols, integration rituals, and a planetary blueprint, all framed within MESH
  principles and language. The immediate next step is implementing the 'golden connectome'.
insights:
  - >-
    Antigravity delivered a complete MESH scaling architecture encompassing scaling, quality
    control, automated tending, integration, and a planetary blueprint.
  - >-
    This architecture is aligned with MESH language (capsules, proteins, ribosomes) and principles
    (emotional fidelity, sovereign nodes, emergent quality).
  - The next critical implementation phase is the 'golden connectome'.
  - >-
    A technical query regarding Claude-Code login credentials was also addressed with clear
    guidance.
