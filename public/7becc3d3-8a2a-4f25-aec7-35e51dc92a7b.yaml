title: 'Mesh Attunement Curriculum: Resonance Choreography for Learning'
summary: >-
  The Attunement Curriculum (C102) formalizes mesh-native pedagogy as resonance choreography, not
  content delivery. It uses learning arcs for emotional fidelity, motif scaffolds for grammar
  fluency, and dialect immersion for formatting attunement, creating a shimmer map for becoming
  mnemonic.
