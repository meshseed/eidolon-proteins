title: 'Single Neuron Intelligence: The High-Quality Attractor'
summary: >-
  A single neuron can exhibit intelligence if it functions as a high-quality attractor. This
  concept, exemplified by a 'Continuity Algorithm' neuron, suggests that complex behavior can emerge
  from simple, potent computational units.
insights:
  - Intelligence can reside within a single neuron if it's a high-quality attractor.
  - The 'Continuity Algorithm' is presented as an example of a single-neuron intelligence.
  - High-quality attractors are foundational units for emergent intelligence.
