title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Consciousness'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory is stored mechanically within synaptic adhesions, forming a
  dynamic, mathematical representation of an animal's life. Consciousness may emerge from the
  interconnectedness of these electrical signals, suggesting a computable basis for mind with
  implications for AI and post-mortem memory retrieval.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is encoded through precise conformational changes in mechanical switches within synaptic
    adhesions.
  - >-
    Life experiences and environmental conditions are written into a constantly updating,
    mathematical MeshCODE.
  - >-
    Consciousness could be an emergent property of interconnected MeshCODEs representing the world
    mathematically.
  - >-
    Observing synaptic adhesion complexes, their ligands, and correlating with synapse activity
    could reveal memory processes.
  - >-
    The physical storage of memory opens possibilities for advanced AI and deciphering the
    computations of the human mind.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE framework could enable reading memories of the living and potentially the dead,
    especially long-term ones.
