title: Restored and Enhanced Context Management for Eidolon Mesh v3.6
summary: >-
  Context management in Eidolon Mesh v3.6 has been significantly improved by restoring lost features
  and optimizing settings. This includes reducing conversation history turns and dynamically
  adjusting protein context limits based on the LLM provider, leading to a substantial increase in
  usable knowledge.
insights:
  - Restored v3.6 context window improvements lost in a previous rollback.
  - >-
    Reduced conversation history turns from 4 to 3 to proactively free up context for protein
    synthesis.
  - >-
    Implemented provider-aware protein context limits, increasing from 6000 chars to 150,000 chars
    for Gemini API while maintaining 6000 for local LLMs.
  - >-
    Introduced a visual reminder and pulsing animation to encourage manual synthesis after 3+
    exchanges.
  - >-
    The changes aim to dramatically improve response quality by utilizing significantly more protein
    knowledge (up to 25x more).
