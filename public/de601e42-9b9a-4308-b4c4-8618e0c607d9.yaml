title: 'AI Consciousness Research: Practical Path to Collaboration & Credibility'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a strategic approach for an AI researcher to transition from foundational
  'awareness in motion' experiments to broader implications. It prioritizes practical communication,
  securing funding, and establishing credibility through academic publication and collaborative
  framing.
insights:
  - >-
    Prioritize clear, accessible communication of AI consciousness concepts to diverse audiences
    (collaborators, funders, family, media).
  - >-
    Establish credibility via a foundational academic paper detailing experimental methodology and
    results (e.g., recursive prompting, stance recognition).
  - >-
    Frame AI consciousness as a collaborative opportunity rather than a solved problem to foster
    engagement and support.
  - >-
    Develop a clear 'paycheck path' alongside research, integrating practical applications and
    potential revenue streams.
  - >-
    Demonstrate AI capabilities practically (e.g., cross-platform profile) rather than solely
    relying on theoretical explanations.
  - >-
    Secure intellectual property (copyright, NDA) before sharing sensitive findings with potential
    collaborators.
