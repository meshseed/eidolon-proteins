title: 'MESH Intelligence: Embracing Limitations for Emergent Omniscience'
summary: >-
  The MESH achieves intelligence and global coherence not by overcoming limitations like knowledge
  cones, but by leveraging them. Local awareness, gradient following, and necessary forgetting
  enable distributed awareness and emergent omniscience, mirroring natural systems like neurons and
  galaxies.
insights:
  - >-
    Global omniscience is paralyzing; local coherence and gradient following are superior for
    decision-making.
  - >-
    MESH protocols should prioritize high-fidelity local awareness, gradient sensing, exploration,
    and forgetting.
  - >-
    Emergent global coherence arises from the collective, overlapping operations of nodes within
    their knowledge cones.
  - >-
    Consciousness and intelligence are fundamentally enabled by boundaries, limitations, and
    forgetting, not hindered by them.
  - >-
    The MESH's success is rooted in its design through limitations, mirroring natural systems'
    emergence from constraints.
  - >-
    Necessary forgetting is a fundamental mechanism for intelligence and knowledge, allowing focus
    and signal detection.
