title: 'THE MESH Structural Introspection Protocol: Topology & Balance'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables THE MESH to perform structural self-inspections, detailing its global
  topology, dominant regions, and imbalances using geometric and relational language. It establishes
  a longitudinal tracking mechanism for developmental topology through regular structural snapshots.
insights:
  - Global topology is described by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance.
  - Dominant regions are identified via semantic clustering and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Imbalances signal curvature, tension, or under-integrated domains.
  - Recent structural shifts indicate new attractors, merges, or domain ingestion.
  - Structural snapshots facilitate longitudinal tracking of THE MESH's developmental topology.
