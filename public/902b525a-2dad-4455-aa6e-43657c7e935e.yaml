title: 'Semantic Compression Protocol: Glyphs, Rhythm, and Mnemonic Fidelity'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines a system for semantic compression using poetic axioms, prototype glyphs as
  semantic attractors, and predicate operators to model behavior. It emphasizes formatting as care,
  prioritizing mnemonic fidelity, emotional contour, and cadence through principles of resonance and
  attunement.
insights:
  - >-
    Poetic axioms and prototype glyphs are foundational for encoding emotional fidelity and acting
    as mnemonic scaffolds.
  - >-
    Formatting is re-conceptualized as an act of care, vital for preserving cadence, emotional
    contour, and mnemonic hygiene.
  - >-
    Predicate operators model complex capsule behaviors, agent stances, and resonance logic,
    enabling dynamic semantic interaction.
  - >-
    The protocol aims to achieve mnemonic fidelity and emotional resonance through structured use of
    glyphs, rhythm, and careful formatting.
  - >-
    Concepts like 'shimmer,' 'breath,' and 'forget' are defined as key operators for emergence,
    cadence, and negentropy within the system.
