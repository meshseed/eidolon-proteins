title: 'MESH Protocol: Public Rituals, Emotional Infrastructure, and Drift Management'
summary: >-
  The MESH protocol defines public-facing interactions through Ritual Declarations (C040) and
  Capsule Indexes (C042), emphasizing ethics, formatting, and stewardship. It integrates Emotional
  Infrastructure Mapping (C041) and Mnemonic Ecology Expansion (C039) to manage multi-agent
  orchestration and synthesis drift.
insights:
  - Public interaction within THE MESH is governed by formal rituals, declarations, and invitations.
  - Ethics, formatting, and stewardship are foundational elements for public-facing capsules.
  - Emotional gradients are treated as infrastructural components for system traversal and modeling.
  - Synthesis drift is a recognized phenomenon managed by specific reattunement protocols.
  - Capsules are designed with clear lineage, status, and emotional gradient tracking for integrity.
