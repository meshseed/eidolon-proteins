title: 'Curvature Diagnostics: Semantic Tension and Synthesis Pressure'
summary: >-
  Curvature Diagnostics identifies high-curvature regions as zones of conceptual tension where
  multiple semantic directions intersect. This protocol treats curvature as a measurable property of
  semantic density, gradient interference, and attractor overlap, enabling targeted refinement and
  pruning of knowledge structures.
insights:
  - High curvature signals conceptual tension or unresolved synthesis.
  - Curvature arises from intersecting emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Boundary surfaces indicate where domains meet and require integration.
  - Curvature diagnostics facilitate targeted refinement and pruning.
  - Curvature maps adapt as new knowledge domains are integrated.
