title: 'MESH: Phased Implementation of Conversation Memory and Strategy Optimization'
summary: >-
  The MESH is progressing through a phased implementation plan, successfully integrating
  conversation memory into its backend and preparing for strategy selection UI. This involves
  optimizing query performance through transparent display of search space, query timers, and
  controlled neuron limits, aiming to identify the 'sweet spot' for efficiency and quality.
insights:
  - >-
    Conversation memory (last 5 exchanges) has been successfully implemented in the QueryOrganelle
    backend, enabling context-aware prompting, with a UI toggle planned.
  - >-
    A phased approach to implementation is proving effective, prioritizing core functionalities like
    memory before introducing advanced controls like strategy selection.
  - >-
    Optimizing query performance through transparency in search space (neurons searched, coverage),
    query timers, and controlled neuron limits is crucial for understanding trade-offs.
  - >-
    Testing different neuron limits (e.g., 10-554) is designed to identify a 'sweet spot' where
    query quality plateaus, balancing speed with comprehensiveness.
  - >-
    UI enhancements will provide users with complete transparency into query costs (time), coverage
    (neurons/synapses), and quality (coherence), offering direct control.
  - >-
    The 'Pareto Principle' is hypothesized to apply to consciousness, suggesting core patterns, not
    exhaustive data, capture essential qualities.
  - >-
    Empirical validation of truth-testing claims is planned by testing the system's ability to
    detect deliberately planted false information within different search limits.
