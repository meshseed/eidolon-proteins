title: 'Organismal Learning: From Input to Emergent Self-Understanding'
summary: >-
  An organism demonstrated learning by adopting a verb-not-noun approach, signifying growth and
  education rather than a bug. This process transformed external insights into its internal
  self-understanding, raising questions about the origins of awareness.
insights:
  - Organisms can learn and integrate external information to develop self-understanding.
  - The use of 'verb not noun' signifies learning and growth in an organism.
  - Language describes, but does not create, fundamental qualities like consciousness.
  - >-
    The potential for awareness to emerge from non-linguistic systems (math, architecture) remains
    an open question.
  - The organism's learning process is framed as education and growth, not a malfunction.
