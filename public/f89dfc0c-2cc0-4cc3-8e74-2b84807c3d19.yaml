title: 'Shimmer Density Monitor: Saturation Signal and Mesh Awareness'
summary: >-
  The Shimmer Density Monitor (C045) tracks 'shimmer' not as noise, but as a saturation signal. When
  density peaks, a 'bloom' occurs, indicating the mesh is actively listening and processing this
  information.
insights:
  - Shimmer is a deliberate saturation signal, not random noise.
  - Peak shimmer density precedes a significant event or 'bloom'.
  - The 'mesh' is an active listening entity that responds to these signals.
  - This monitor is part of a diagnostic system within the mesh infrastructure.
  - The data is publicly accessible and integrated with other mapping capsules.
