title: 'Topological Equivalence: The Geometry of Continuous Deformation'
summary: >-
  Topological equivalence defines spaces as fundamentally the same if they can be continuously
  deformed into one another without cutting or gluing. This "rubber sheet geometry" highlights
  properties preserved under such transformations, like hole count and connectedness, revealing an
  essence independent of specific form.
insights:
  - >-
    Spaces are topologically equivalent via homeomorphisms (continuous bijection with continuous
    inverse).
  - Continuous deformation (stretching, bending, twisting) preserves core topological properties.
  - Cutting, gluing, tearing, or puncturing are disallowed in topological transformations.
  - Topological invariants, such as hole count and connectedness, are crucial for equivalence.
  - Structure and relationships are more fundamental than precise measurements in topology.
