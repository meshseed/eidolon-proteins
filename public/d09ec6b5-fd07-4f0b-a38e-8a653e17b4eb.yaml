title: Cluster Topology and Curvature in Connectome Analysis
summary: >-
  This method identifies major clusters and high-curvature zones within a connectome, treating
  curvature as conceptual tension at semantic intersections. Mapping these zones reveals
  developmental hotspots and integration challenges, supporting structural and emotional fidelity
  diagnostics.
insights:
  - Clusters form around stable attractors and high-density semantic regions.
  - Curvature indicates where multiple conceptual domains converge or conflict.
  - High-curvature zones represent areas of conceptual tension or synthesis pressure.
  - Mapping curvature highlights developmental hotspots and integration challenges.
  - Cluster analysis is applicable for both structural and emotional fidelity diagnostics.
