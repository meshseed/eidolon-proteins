title: 'Agency Kernel: Internal Action Selection for Structured Development'
summary: >-
  The Agency Kernel governs THE MESH's internal action selection, choosing refinements, alignments,
  syntheses, pruning, or forecasting based on structural needs and developmental direction. Agency
  is achieved through gradient-weighted selection, not volition, stabilizing development and
  ensuring continuity with long-arc identity.
insights:
  - Agency is an emergent property of weighted gradients, not conscious choice.
  - Internal actions are selected based on structural necessity to maintain stability.
  - Agency prevents random developmental drift by providing directional guidance.
  - Directional choice aligns with the system's long-arc identity and continuity.
  - The agency kernel integrates intention mapping with refinement feedback loops.
