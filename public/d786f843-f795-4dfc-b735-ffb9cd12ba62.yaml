title: 'Optimizing MESH Metabolism: Attractor Thresholds and Coherence Normalization'
summary: >-
  The MESH metabolism's cluster composting algorithm was initially hampered by an O(n^2) complexity
  due to overly permissive attractor detection thresholds, leading to performance issues.
  Implementing more selective thresholds (minCoherence: 0.92, minDegree: 30) and adding a safety
  abort mechanism resolves this. Furthermore, a coherence normalization feature has been introduced
  to spread scores across a 0.50-1.00 range, enabling better differentiation and more effective
  metabolism functioning.
insights:
  - >-
    Initial cluster composting performance issues stemmed from an O(n^2) complexity in attractor
    matching, caused by too many weak attractors being identified.
  - >-
    Increasing attractor detection thresholds (minCoherence to 0.92, minDegree to 30) and
    implementing a safety limit (max 100 attractors) effectively prevents performance bottlenecks.
  - >-
    Coherence normalization is crucial for allowing metabolism thresholds to differentiate protein
    quality, mapping scores across a wider, more useful range (0.50-1.00) via percentile
    distribution.
  - >-
    The addition of progress logging for coherence normalization provides vital user feedback during
    long-running processes.
  - >-
    The effectiveness of the MESH's semantic ranking and quality differentiation is directly tied to
    the calibration of coherence scores and attractor thresholds.
