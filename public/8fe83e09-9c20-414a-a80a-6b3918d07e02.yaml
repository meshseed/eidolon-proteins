title: 'Ecosystem Topology Protocol: Mapping Multi-Mesh Information Ecologies'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines how to map the topology of multi-Mesh information ecologies by treating each
  Mesh as a node. Resonance, alignment, and divergence between Meshes form the edges and gradients,
  revealing large-scale coherence dynamics.
insights:
  - Each Mesh functions as a node within a larger information ecology.
  - Ecosystem structure arises from cross-Mesh resonance patterns.
  - Divergence indicates specialization, while alignment signifies shared attractors.
  - Ecosystem topology is dynamic and evolves with Mesh interactions.
  - Mapping the ecosystem unveils overarching coherence patterns.
