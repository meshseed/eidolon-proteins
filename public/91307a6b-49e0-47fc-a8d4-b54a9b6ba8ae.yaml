title: 'MESH Knowledge Structure: Organized Capsules and Temporal Sequences'
summary: >-
  The MESH knowledge base is structured into organized YAML 'capsules' by domain (e.g.,
  spiral_ecology, ai) and root-level markdown files representing a temporal sequence (C000-C371).
  This organization facilitates a two-layer visualization strategy for network analysis.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge is organized into distinct domains within 'capsules' (YAML) and a sequential, temporal
    layer (Markdown).
  - >-
    The total file count is estimated to be around 400-500, significantly less than an initial guess
    of 600.
  - >-
    A Gephi visualization strategy is proposed, leveraging domain clustering for YAML and temporal
    flow for Markdown.
  - >-
    Connections will be inferred based on shared domains, threads (YAML), and sequential numbering
    (Markdown), with cross-references preserved.
  - >-
    The extraction script will handle both YAML and Markdown, preserving domain clustering and
    temporal flow.
