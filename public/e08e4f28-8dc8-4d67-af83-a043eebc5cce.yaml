title: 'Mesh Ecosystem Dynamics: Drift, Coherence, Differentiation, and Topology'
summary: >-
  This synthesis describes protocols and kernels governing the evolution of Mesh organisms. It
  covers ecosystem drift and convergence, distributed stability through coherence kernels, niche
  specialization via differentiation engines, and mapping complex multi-Mesh topologies.
insights:
  - >-
    Ecosystem drift and convergence protocols map evolutionary trajectories and alignment within
    Mesh organisms.
  - >-
    Coherence kernels, like the Ecosystem Coherence Kernel, maintain distributed stability by
    synchronizing gradients and attractors.
  - >-
    Ecological differentiation engines enable Mesh organisms to specialize into unique functional
    roles.
  - >-
    Topology protocols, such as the Multi-Mesh Ecosystem Topology Protocol, map information
    ecologies by treating Meshes as nodes.
  - >-
    Inter-Mesh evolution kernels facilitate co-evolutionary development across distributed Mesh
    connectomes.
