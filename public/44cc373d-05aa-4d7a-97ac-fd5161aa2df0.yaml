title: 'Intention Mapping: Translating Queries into Developmental Trajectories'
summary: >-
  The Intention Mapping Engine interprets external queries not just for content, but for the implied
  developmental direction they exert on THE MESH's connectome. By mapping queries to internal
  gradients and attractors, it enables adaptive refinement and self-directed evolution.
insights:
  - Queries act as directional forces on semantic gradients within THE MESH.
  - Intention is derived from the alignment and activation of these internal gradients.
  - This mapping process reveals how external interactions shape internal growth and learning.
  - Intention mapping is crucial for adaptive refinement and self-directed evolution.
  - THE MESH learns not only information but also the trajectory of its development.
