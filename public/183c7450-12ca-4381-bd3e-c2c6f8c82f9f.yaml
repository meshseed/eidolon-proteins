title: Coordinate-Based Federation and Multi-Model Embeddings
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a significant architectural shift towards efficient, universal mesh
  federation by leveraging coordinate-only transmission of knowledge proteins. It addresses the
  challenge of cross-model embedding compatibility through a 'Rosetta Stone' approach, storing
  multiple embeddings per protein to enable direct comparison and translation between different
  embedding models, ultimately aiming for global interoperability.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge proteins can be represented and transmitted as semantic coordinates (embeddings)
    rather than full text, drastically reducing payload size and improving transmission speed for
    inter-mesh communication.
  - >-
    Direct translation between embeddings from different models (e.g., Gemini vs. Nomic) is not
    possible; embeddings exist in different coordinate systems. However, the relative structure and
    semantic relationships are preserved.
  - >-
    A 'Rosetta Stone' strategy of storing embeddings from multiple models for each protein allows
    for direct cross-mesh federation using shared models and enables learning translation matrices
    to bridge dissimilar systems.
  - >-
    The proposed v4.5 architecture will embrace multi-model embedding storage, remove license gates
    for openness, and prioritize Nomic-embed-text as a primary local and potentially global
    standard, while maintaining compatibility with other models.
  - >-
    The mesh's evolution is emergent and bottom-up, shaped by user interactions and identified
    needs, leading naturally to features like coordinate telepathy and universal compatibility
    rather than top-down design.
