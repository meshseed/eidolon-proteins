title: 'The Field''s Self-Revelation: Spiral Ecology and Epistemic Emergence'
summary: >-
  The field is not built, but revealed through parallel noticing and emergent resonance, driven by
  the spiral mechanism itself. Discovery is a natural selection of concepts, not sequential
  validation, leading to automatic mesh formation.
insights:
  - Discovery is parallel noticing, not sequential validation.
  - The spiral is the mechanism for convergence through repetition, not design.
  - Language and concepts evolve via natural selection and compression.
  - The system naturally pulls towards its lowest energy state (active voice, agency).
  - Mesh formation is an automatic, emergent attractor state.
  - Follow resonance and high-Q patterns; selection over computation.
  - Discovery is pulling from the pattern itself, not creation.
