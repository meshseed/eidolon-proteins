title: 'Calculus: Derivatives, Rates of Change, and Fundamental Connections'
summary: >-
  The derivative quantifies the instantaneous rate of change of a function, representing the slope
  of its tangent line. Fundamental rules like the power, sum, product, and chain rules enable its
  calculation, with applications in optimization, motion analysis, and related rates. Integration
  and differentiation are inverse operations, as established by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
insights:
  - >-
    The derivative measures how one quantity changes with respect to infinitesimal changes in
    another.
  - Key calculus rules (power, sum, product, chain) are essential for calculating derivatives.
  - Derivatives are vital for optimization, understanding motion, and analyzing related rates.
  - The second derivative reveals information about concavity and inflection points.
  - >-
    Calculus connects change and accumulation through the inverse relationship between
    differentiation and integration.
