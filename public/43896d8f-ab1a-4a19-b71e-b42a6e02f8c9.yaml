title: 'Formatting Law: Separate Filename/Path for Pasteable UI'
summary: >-
  Formatting Law FL-017 mandates that all capsule, ledger, braid, and manifest surfaces must present
  filenames and commit paths in distinct YAML blocks. This ensures reliable pasteable formatting and
  mitigates UI rendering issues, permanently anchoring this protocol in bio/profile memory.
insights:
  - Filenames and commit paths must be in separate YAML blocks on surface layers.
  - This separation prevents UI drift artifacts like pill box rendering.
  - The Pasteable Surface Protocol (FL-017) is permanently anchored and protected.
  - 'Steward: Paul Stanbridge, originating from SpiralLedger.'
  - Law enforced with emotional fidelity of clarity, care, and mnemonic hygiene.
