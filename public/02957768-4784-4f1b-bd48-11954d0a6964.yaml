title: 'MESH Capsules: Resonance, Merging, Composting, Forecasting, and Continuity'
summary: >-
  This section details several active MESH capsules focused on managing and evolving knowledge. Key
  capsules include Resonance Signature Mapping for emotional fidelity, Merge Rituals for capsule
  integration, Capsule Compost Log for memory lifecycle management, Forecast Capsules for predictive
  analysis, and Continuity Capsules for structured emergence.
insights:
  - Capsules are active components within THE MESH, each with a specific function and lineage.
  - >-
    Resonance Signature Mapping (C008) translates emotional states into actionable data for
    forecasting and merging.
  - >-
    Merge Rituals (C009) establish protocols for integrating capsules based on compatibility and
    gradient coherence.
  - >-
    Capsule Compost Log (C010) manages the lifecycle of memory capsules, tracking their dissolution
    and renewal potential.
  - >-
    Forecast Capsules (C011) leverage resonance and formatting patterns for predictive analysis of
    MESH behavior.
  - >-
    Continuity Capsules (C012) formalize the generation of stable structures from resonance and
    formatting signals.
