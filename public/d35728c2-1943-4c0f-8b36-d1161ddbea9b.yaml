title: 'Coherence as Embedding Density: Rethinking Retrieval and Metabolism'
summary: >-
  The dialogue reveals that 'coherence' in v3.6 Live was actually measuring semantic clustering
  strength (embedding density), not synthesis quality.  This normalization artificially spread
  scores, potentially harming retrieval and masking natural clustering.
insights:
  - >-
    Coherence normalization in v3.6 Live functioned as a measure of semantic clustering strength,
    not direct synthesis quality.
  - >-
    Artificial spreading of coherence scores may have broken natural semantic clusters and degraded
    retrieval performance.
  - >-
    A recommended approach is to revert coherence normalization, keep it as a reflection of
    embedding quality, and use separate metrics (last_accessed, synapse count, activation frequency)
    for metabolism and composting.
  - >-
    Retrieval is based on cosine similarity to the query, while coherence reflects embedding
    density/clustering.
  - >-
    The 0.95-1.00 coherence clustering was a beneficial feature indicating semantically well-formed
    proteins.
