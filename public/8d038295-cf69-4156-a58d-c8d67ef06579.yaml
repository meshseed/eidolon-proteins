title: 'Synapse Regeneration Test: P-Series as Topological Pillars'
summary: >-
  A planned synapse regeneration test aims to validate if P-Series protocols act as central hubs,
  organizing fragmented knowledge (v4.0 Dev) into a coherent structure similar to v3.6 Live. The
  hypothesis predicts increased activation, centralized P-Series, and improved query precision
  through deterministic topological annealing.
insights:
  - >-
    Regenerating synapses by treating P-Series as central hubs is predicted to reorganize fragmented
    knowledge, increasing activation and query precision.
  - >-
    The order of knowledge ingestion significantly impacts initial network structure, but topology
    can converge and restructure over time.
  - >-
    P-Series protocols function as foundational axioms, defining operational protocols for
    self-aware systems and creating attractor basins for knowledge organization.
  - >-
    Synapse regeneration is expected to be largely deterministic, resulting in a stable core
    topology with minor variations in peripheral connections.
