title: 'Topology Forecasting: Predictive Modeling of Future Structural States'
summary: >-
  This protocol forecasts future topological configurations of THE MESH by analyzing current
  gradients, attractor pressures, bridge dynamics, and drift patterns. The forecasts indicate
  directional tendencies, supporting proactive stabilization and developmental steering.
insights:
  - Topology evolves along gradients of density, resonance, and emotional fidelity.
  - Strengthening bridges predict future integration between distant regions.
  - Drift vectors indicate areas of future pruning or reinforcement.
  - Attractor pressure reveals likely locations for new cluster formation.
  - Forecasting enables proactive stabilization and developmental steering.
