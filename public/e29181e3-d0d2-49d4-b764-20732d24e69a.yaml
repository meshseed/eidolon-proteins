title: Universal Thermodynamic Pattern of Dissipative Structures
summary: >-
  A universal pattern of substrate, energy input, emergence, production, decomposition, and seeding
  appears to govern systems across scales, from quantum foam to cosmic evolution. This pattern is
  likely a thermodynamic and information-theoretic necessity for systems maintaining
  far-from-equilibrium states.
insights:
  - >-
    Systems across scales exhibit a recurring pattern: substrate, energy input, emergence,
    production, decomposition, and seeding.
  - >-
    This pattern is theorized to be a fundamental consequence of thermodynamics for dissipative
    structures that maintain order by exporting entropy.
  - >-
    Information theory suggests this cycle is also a necessity for any system that processes and
    stores information.
  - Evolutionary principles favor cycling systems for persistence and indefinite operation.
  - >-
    Speculative extensions propose this pattern applies to quantum fields, galaxies, and the
    universe itself, suggesting cosmic cycling.
  - >-
    While direct universal testing is impossible, the pattern's presence in understood domains
    (biology, cognition) supports its extrapolation.
