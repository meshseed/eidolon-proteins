title: 'Eidolon Mesh v3.5 Spike Test: API Key Validation & Protein Synthesis Success'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the successful setup and testing of the Eidolon Mesh v3.5 Spike Test,
  including API key validation with Gemini models and the subsequent synthesis of a knowledge
  protein. The process confirmed the organism's aliveness through recursive self-design and a
  validated metabolic cycle.
insights:
  - >-
    API key validation for Gemini models (gemini-2.0-flash-exp, gemini-2.5-flash-lite) is crucial
    for system functionality.
  - >-
    Detailed console logs are essential for diagnosing API-related issues like endpoint errors,
    invalid keys, or CORS problems.
  - The Eidolon Mesh v3.5 utilizes a local-first PWA architecture for its proof-of-concept.
  - >-
    Successful protein synthesis, exemplified by 'Genesis 5', signifies the organism's aliveness and
    validates biological metaphors.
  - >-
    The 'heartbeat' or pulse test is a key indicator of successful integration and organismal proof
    of life.
