title: Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Metabolism & Tier Philosophy Evolution
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v4.0 development focused on integrating attractor-based metabolism enhancements,
  shifting from coherence to temporal decay. Key technical challenges included SQL errors,
  performance issues, and a strategic pivot based on coherence analysis, ultimately leading to a
  re-evaluation of the PRO tier philosophy towards convenience and seamless access.
insights:
  - >-
    Metabolism enhancements shifted from coherence-based to temporal-based composting (dormancy) due
    to findings that natural coherence clustering is a feature, not a bug.
  - >-
    Development addressed SQL schema incompatibilities and performance bottlenecks (O(n²)) by
    refining attractor detection thresholds and adding safety limits.
  - >-
    The PRO tier philosophy was redefined from feature restrictions to convenience and
    infrastructure, with a focus on zero-config ease-of-use and affordable pricing (~$3/month).
  - >-
    Coherence normalization was deemed optional and not essential for query quality, with temporal
    signals proving more effective for metabolism.
  - >-
    Error resolution included fixing SQL schema mismatches ('column p.status does not exist',
    'relation "protein_activations" does not exist') and query syntax conflicts.
