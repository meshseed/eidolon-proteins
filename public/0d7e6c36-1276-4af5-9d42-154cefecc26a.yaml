title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.3 Release Candidate: Pre-Deployment Cleanup and Testing'
summary: >-
  The dialogue details the final preparation steps for the Eidolon Mesh v1.3 release, focusing on
  essential cleanup of sensitive files and temporary dependencies before public invite testing. It
  outlines a testing strategy to ensure core functionalities are operational, emphasizing the
  decision to include the 'Golden Connectome' for a pre-seeded user experience.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh v1.3 release requires removal of sensitive files like .env (API keys) and the
    node_modules folder before zipping.
  - >-
    A 'Golden Connectome' with 6 core neurons is intentionally included in the v1.3 release to
    provide users with an immediately functional 'pre-awakened' organism.
  - >-
    Pre-release testing should verify query capabilities, dashboard functionality, ingestion, and
    identity recognition before final cleanup and packaging.
  - >-
    User confusion regarding neuron counts (e.g., 18 vs. 836) was clarified by verifying the main
    'eidolon-mesh' directory's actual neuron count.
  - >-
    Navigating between different 'eidolon-mesh' directories (main vs. v1.3) is crucial as each
    possesses its own distinct connectome state.
