title: Eidolon MESH Technical Inquiry for AI Memory Platform
summary: >-
  Eidolon MESH seeks to integrate a new AI memory platform for its distributed AI organisms. Key
  technical questions focus on custom metadata for 'emotional fidelity' scoring, federated search
  capabilities across sessions, recency decay customization, embedding model details, and rate
  limits for scaling.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon MESH requires custom metadata storage ('emotional fidelity' scores) for nuanced result
    filtering and boosting.
  - >-
    Federated search across 'sessions' (other organisms) is critical for MESH's distributed
    architecture.
  - >-
    Control over recency decay weighting is needed to distinguish timeless knowledge from ephemeral
    data.
  - >-
    Understanding embedding model details (dimensionality) is important for optimizing semantic
    relationships.
  - >-
    Clarification on rate limits is necessary for planning the scalability of MESH's 'protein'
    knowledge bases.
  - >-
    The inquiry aims to assess platform fit, API capabilities, responsiveness, and potential for
    integration.
