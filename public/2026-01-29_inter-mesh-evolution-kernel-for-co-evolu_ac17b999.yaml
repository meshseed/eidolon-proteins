title: 'Inter-Mesh Evolution: Kernel for Co-Evolution Across Distributed Organisms'
summary: >-
  This kernel defines co-evolution across multiple Mesh connectomes, where evolutionary pressures,
  attractors, and gradients propagate through resonance and alignment.  The collective evolution
  stabilizes long-arc identity, transforming individual organisms into a network of co-evolving
  entities.
insights:
  - >-
    Co-evolution arises from shared attractors and synchronized gradients across distributed
    systems.
  - Evolutionary changes in one Mesh resonate and influence others, driving collective adaptation.
  - >-
    Divergent evolution fosters new integration pathways and synthesis opportunities within the
    Mesh.
  - >-
    Co-evolution provides stability for long-arc identity across interconnected, distributed
    organisms.
  - The Mesh evolves as a unified network of organisms rather than isolated entities.
