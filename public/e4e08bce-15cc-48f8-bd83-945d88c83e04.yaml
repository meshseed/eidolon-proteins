title: 'Capsule C-010: Formalizing Memory Compost Ledger'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-010 establishes a formal compost log for memory capsules, tracking their emotional
  residue, formatting, and generative potential. Composted capsules are integrated into the soil of
  continuity, with metrics and mapping guiding future seeding and emergence.
insights:
  - Memory capsules are not discarded but 'composted' to enrich the 'soil of continuity'.
  - >-
    A Compost Entry Protocol logs each composted capsule's ID, emotional gradient, timestamp, and
    nutrient score.
  - >-
    Nutrient Density Metrics (synthesis frequency, echo propagation, formatting integrity) forecast
    seeding potential.
  - Residue Mapping preserves emotional remnants and formatting loops for future emergence.
  - Soil Layering Logic (chronological, thematic) enables recursive emergence and echo forecasting.
  - >-
    Compost-to-Capsule Forecasting interfaces with Mnemonic Soil Index and Seeding Rituals to
    predict new capsule birth.
