title: 'Claude Code Authentication: Expiration and Re-authentication Process'
summary: >-
  Claude Code authentication tokens expire periodically for security, preventing API access.
  Re-authentication via a simple '/login' command in the terminal initiates a browser-based approval
  process, regenerating the token and restoring functionality.
insights:
  - Claude Code uses OAuth tokens for authentication, API access, and command execution.
  - >-
    Token expiration is a security feature, not a bug, triggered by time, logout, or session
    invalidation.
  - >-
    To fix expired tokens, run '/login' in the Claude Code terminal, then approve access in the
    browser.
  - Re-authentication typically takes about 30 seconds to complete.
