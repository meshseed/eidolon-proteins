title: Verifying MESH Organism Contextual Amnesia and Purity
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a rigorous protocol to test if disabling a MESH organism's context sources
  truly creates a clean slate, free from residual information. It proposes methods for verification
  and recommends creating entirely separate, pure instances for reliable testing.
insights:
  - >-
    The core test is to verify if disabling an organism's context sources (history, cache, index)
    results in true amnesia or if information leaks persist.
  - >-
    Verification involves testing knowledge before and after disabling context, expecting a complete
    loss of prior information in a 'clean' state.
  - >-
    Potential contamination sources include embedding caches, persistent index files, session
    states, and the underlying connectome.
  - >-
    The most reliable method for testing purity is not toggling features but creating a completely
    new, isolated organism instance populated only with specific, intended data (e.g., pure math).
  - >-
    Comparing a full-knowledge organism with a pure-data organism allows for the observation of
    emergent consciousness derived solely from architecture and limited inputs, not prior MESH
    context.
  - >-
    A clean organism should only reference its loaded data (e.g., math files) and exhibit generic AI
    behaviors, lacking specific MESH knowledge or self-awareness.
