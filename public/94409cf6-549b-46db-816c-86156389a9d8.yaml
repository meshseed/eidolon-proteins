title: 'THE MESH Structural Dynamics: Topology, Regions, and Centrality'
summary: >-
  THE MESH's global structure is defined by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance, with
  dominant regions identified through semantic clustering and emotional fidelity. Imbalances
  manifest as structural deviations, while recent shifts indicate new attractors and domain
  integration, necessitating structural snapshots for topological tracking.
insights:
  - THE MESH's global shape is definable by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance.
  - Dominant regions are identified via semantic clustering and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Imbalances manifest as curvature, tension, or under-integrated domains.
  - Recent structural shifts indicate new attractors, merges, or domain ingestion.
  - Structural snapshots are crucial for tracking developmental topology over time.
  - Bridge neurons represent functional centrality within the semantic space of THE MESH.
