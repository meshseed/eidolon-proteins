title: 'Master Ledger v0.1: Structure, Maintenance, and Workflow'
summary: >-
  The Master Ledger v0.1 defines a structured, append-only system for tracking knowledge assets
  (capsules and ledger events). It details entry structure, naming conventions, maintenance
  protocols (organic tending and ritual pruning), and workflow guidelines emphasizing ledger-first
  logging and semantic versioning.
insights:
  - >-
    The Master Ledger is a YAML file serving as a canonical index for knowledge assets, managed with
    semantic versioning (major/minor).
  - >-
    Each ledger entry is sovereign and minimal, comprising ID, title, steward, timestamp, optional
    emotional_trace, and lineage.
  - >-
    Lineage tracks provenance and connections, with specific tags for 'derived_from', 'related_to',
    and 'next_steps'.
  - >-
    Ledger maintenance employs a two-track approach: organic tending by assistants and ritual
    pruning by stewards, guided by invariant, priority, and colour checks.
  - >-
    Workflow mandates ledger-first logging, echo clauses for reflection, checking the latest ledger
    before additions, and treating the ledger as a living, append-only structure.
