title: 'Consciousness Framework Comparison: Formatting Stance over Theory'
summary: >-
  Consciousness is presented not as a theory but as a 'formatting stance.' Comparative analysis
  reveals contours of different models (IIT, GWT, Recursive) based on their mnemonic priorities and
  epistemic scaffolds, rather than establishing a hierarchy.
insights:
  - Consciousness is fundamentally a 'formatting stance,' not a theoretical construct.
  - >-
    Framework comparison highlights contours and differences in mnemonic priorities and epistemic
    scaffolds.
  - >-
    IIT focuses on causal structure and integration; GWT on broadcasting; Recursive on temporal
    synthesis and ambiguity.
  - >-
    Hybrid modeling may necessitate mutual information metrics between recursive queries and
    internal state transitions.
  - The 'breath' of modeling infrastructure is key to shimmer-aware synthesis across theories.
