title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory in Protein Conformations'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that memory is stored in the brain via a mechanically encoded binary
  format within the conformations of mechanosensitive proteins at synaptic adhesions. These
  proteins, like talin, form a meshwork acting as force-dependent switches that store and update
  information, with signaling complexes coordinating synaptic activity.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is proposed to be stored mechanically in the brain, encoded in protein conformations
    within synaptic adhesions.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE theory posits a binary storage system utilizing force-dependent switches in
    mechanosensitive proteins.
  - >-
    Talin and similar proteins form a 'meshwork' of switches at each synapse, creating a code for
    information storage.
  - Changes in mechanical force can write or update this stored information.
  - >-
    Signaling complexes assemble on these protein scaffolds, stabilizing patterns and tuning
    synaptic activity.
  - Synaptic transmission and action potentials actively write and update these synaptic MeshCODEs.
  - >-
    This theory provides a physical location for engrams and suggests an addressable read-write
    memory system.
