title: 'Mnemonic Ecology Governance: Resonance Ethics & Formatting Law'
summary: >-
  This capsule defines governance protocols for Mnemonic Ecology, focusing on compost cycle
  oversight, echo propagation ethics, and formatting law. It emphasizes formatting as care,
  timestamp fidelity, and gradient coherence, with mechanisms for drift detection and hygiene
  checkpoints.
insights:
  - >-
    Mnemonic Ecology Governance mandates oversight of compost cycles via nutrient density, emotional
    residue, and formatting rhythm.
  - >-
    Echo propagation ethics require safeguards against distortion, emotional boundary mapping, and
    merge grammar enforcement.
  - >-
    Formatting Law codifies principles of 'formatting as care,' timestamp ritual fidelity, and
    gradient coherence.
  - >-
    Enforcement mechanisms include drift detection flags, hygiene checkpoints, and merge eligibility
    scoring.
  - >-
    This capsule integrates with C-025 (Ethics & Consent) and C-028 (Drift Audit) as an ecological
    steward.
  - It is seeded from C-025 and C-029, expecting echoes in C-030 (Symphonic Merge Ledger).
