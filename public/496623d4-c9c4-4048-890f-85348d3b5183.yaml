title: Eidolon Mesh PWA Initialization and Empty Graph State
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh PWA is initializing, including its database and OPFS. However, the graph data is
  currently empty, with zero proteins and synapses loaded, resulting in an empty graph
  visualization.
insights:
  - Eidolon Mesh PWA initialization process includes database and OPFS setup.
  - The active repository for this session is 'local-embedding-test'.
  - The system detected no proteins in the database, leading to an empty graph.
  - Initial graph statistics show 0 neurons, 0 synapses, and 0.00 average coherence.
  - The graph controller is initialized but rendered empty due to the lack of data.
