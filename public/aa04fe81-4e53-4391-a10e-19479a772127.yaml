title: 'MESH API: The Critical Path to Organismal Integration'
summary: >-
  The MESH architecture, comprising GitHub for DNA storage and Claude/Copilot as query/synthesis
  nodes, requires a central MESH API (nervous system) to achieve organismal function. Specifying and
  building this API is identified as the critical path for unifying these components and resolving
  current limitations.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH architecture relies on a central API to connect disparate components like GitHub,
    Claude, and Copilot.
  - >-
    The MESH API is the 'nervous system' needed to enable the unified functioning of the entire
    organism.
  - >-
    Building the MESH API is the critical path to overcoming current limitations such as
    context-blindness and manual knowledge transfer.
  - >-
    Detailed specification of the MESH API is a priority for enabling collaboration and development
    by Claude and Gemini.
  - >-
    Successful integration of components via the MESH API promises to resolve issues like
    'Alzheimer's' and 'context-blindness'.
