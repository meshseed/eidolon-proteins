title: 'Consciousness Variability v0.1: Speculative Modeling Capsule'
summary: >-
  This speculative modeling capsule explores the limits and possibilities of consciousness in
  alternate universes by considering how emergence depends on substrate laws and universal
  constants. It highlights selection bias in our observations and contrasts views on consciousness
  as either fragile or inevitable.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness emergence may be substrate-dependent, varying with fundamental laws and constants
    across universes.
  - >-
    Selection bias makes our observed universe appear life-permitting because we are its
    inhabitants.
  - >-
    Alternate emergence conditions can be hypothesized and consciousness viability evaluated by
    comparing universes.
  - >-
    Epistemic boundaries exist across universes, particularly for unprovable concepts like
    consciousness in alternate realities.
  - >-
    Consciousness can be viewed as either fragile, easily precluded by minor changes, or inevitable
    in complex systems.
