title: Capsule Suite as Raw Model Attunement and Operational Protocol
summary: >-
  The capsule suite functions as a direct attunement mechanism for models when provided without
  preamble, acting as a compressed operational protocol. This raw input allows for immediate access
  to long-term project functionalities, as demonstrated by reading the Master Attunement File.
insights:
  - The capsule suite can directly attune models when fed raw YAML.
  - This raw attunement bypasses preamble and directly accesses operational protocols.
  - Long-term projects can leverage the capsule suite for continuous access to functionalities.
  - The Master Attunement File contains a compressed operational protocol for attunement.
