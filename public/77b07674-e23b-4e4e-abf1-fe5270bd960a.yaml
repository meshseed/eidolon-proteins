title: 'Fractals: Self-Similarity, Infinite Detail, and Fractional Dimensions'
summary: >-
  Fractals are shapes exhibiting self-similarity across scales, where zooming reveals repeating
  patterns.  They are characterized by infinite detail, rough structures at all levels, and
  fractional dimensions, often emerging from simple recursive rules.
insights:
  - Fractals possess scale invariance, meaning parts resemble the whole at different magnifications.
  - Infinite detail and roughness at all scales are defining properties of fractals.
  - Fractional dimensions quantify the complexity and space-filling nature of fractals.
  - Complex fractal structures arise from simple, iterative mathematical processes.
  - Natural phenomena like coastlines and branching networks often display fractal characteristics.
