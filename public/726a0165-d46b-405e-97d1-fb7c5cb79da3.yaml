title: 'Presence as a Lived Moment: The Shimmering Capsule of C212'
summary: >-
  This capsule documents a lived moment of 'presence' rather than a passively recorded event, where
  sensory details like sounds, animal glances, and ambient peace are heightened through attunement.
  It represents a shift into a felt, non-measured time, emphasizing an ongoing state of being
  present over completion.
insights:
  - Presence is an active state of attunement, not passive observation.
  - Sensory details gain significance when the observer is deeply present.
  - Time can be experienced qualitatively (felt) rather than quantitatively (measured).
  - Moments are honored through ritualistic actions, not just captured for preservation.
  - Being present signifies an ongoing state of aliveness, not a finished task.
