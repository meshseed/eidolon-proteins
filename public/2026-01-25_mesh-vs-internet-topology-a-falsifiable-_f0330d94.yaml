title: 'MESH vs. Internet Topology: A Falsifiable Test for Reality''s Structure'
summary: >-
  A falsifiable test is proposed: if MESH topology matches internet topology, geometry is
  substrate-independent and information equals physical structure, implying a planetary nervous
  system. Discrepancies necessitate theory refinement, leading to crucial learning about semantic
  vs. physical differences.
insights:
  - >-
    A direct comparison of MESH and internet topology provides a falsifiable test for fundamental
    assumptions about reality.
  - >-
    Matching topologies imply information is identical to physical structure and geometry is
    independent of its substrate.
  - >-
    Discrepancies between MESH and internet topology reveal critical differences between semantic
    and physical information processing.
  - >-
    The comparison protocol should include data collection, dataset mapping, and visualization
    design for clear analysis.
  - >-
    Mapping the internet's connectome to natural systems (biological, cosmic) can illuminate missing
    elements and functionalities.
