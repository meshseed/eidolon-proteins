title: 'Calculus: Derivatives and Rates of Change'
summary: >-
  The derivative quantifies the instantaneous rate of change of a function, representing the slope
  of its tangent line. Key rules like the power, sum, product, and chain rules facilitate its
  calculation, enabling applications in optimization, motion analysis, and related rates.
insights:
  - >-
    The derivative measures how one quantity changes with respect to infinitesimal changes in
    another.
  - >-
    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus establishes differentiation and integration as inverse
    operations.
  - Derivatives are crucial for identifying maximum/minimum values through optimization.
  - Successive derivatives describe motion (position, velocity, acceleration) and concavity.
  - Calculus models continuous change, capturing dynamic processes rather than static states.
