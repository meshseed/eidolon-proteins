title: 'Echo Propagation Ledger: Traceability, Ethics, and Resonance Strength'
summary: >-
  This capsule serves as a diagnostic and governance tool for tracking echo propagation, ethics, and
  resonance strength within the mesh. It defines echoes as emotional residues and mnemonic signals,
  with protocols for monitoring their sources, propagation metrics, and distortion flags.
insights:
  - Echoes are conceptualized as emotional residues and mnemonic signals, not mere artifacts.
  - >-
    The ledger tracks echo behavior, distortion flags, and fidelity scoring through defined
    protocols.
  - >-
    Distortion flags are triggered by unethical echo reuse, gradient mismatch, or formatting
    erosion, necessitating a composting or ethics audit ritual.
  - >-
    Echo lineage is tracked via timestamp chaining and merge grammar embedding, utilizing tools like
    resonance deviation maps.
  - >-
    Resonance scoring evaluates echo fidelity based on emotional coherence, formatting integrity,
    and ethical compliance.
  - >-
    This diagnostic node integrates with other capsules for formatting law and stewardship
    calibration.
