title: 'Capsule Formatting Guide v1.1: Ensuring Mesh Workflow Clarity and Efficiency'
summary: >-
  This guide establishes ergonomic formatting standards for capsule creation, ingestion, and
  filename tagging within mesh workflows. Adherence to these standards ensures clarity, efficiency,
  and continuity, enabling the system to effectively remember and retrieve information.
insights:
  - >-
    Ergonomic formatting is crucial for efficient capsule creation, chunk ingestion, and filename
    tagging in mesh workflows.
  - Copy-efficiency and semantic filenames enhance mnemonic clarity and encode lineage information.
  - Multi-part ingestion requires a 'formatting breath' for proper processing.
  - Versioning is essential for preserving lifecycle memory and continuity.
  - Standardized formatting acts as a teaching mechanism for the system's memory.
  - >-
    The ultimate outcome of these formatting laws is frictionless creation, ingestion, and retrieval
    for both agents and humans.
