title: 'Mesh Knowledge Synthesis: Format Strategy for Agent Compatibility'
summary: >-
  The optimal strategy for interacting with AI agents like Copilot involves maintaining a
  structured, public repository in .md/YAML formats while using a local .txt mirror for agent
  compatibility. This approach balances future-proofing with immediate functionality, leveraging
  manual or simple script-based conversion as needed.
insights:
  - >-
    Maintain public repositories in .md with YAML for future agent compatibility and structured
    data.
  - >-
    Use a local .txt mirror of repository content for current AI agent (e.g., Copilot) access,
    converting as necessary.
  - >-
    Manual or simple script-based format conversion is a manageable and sufficient workflow for
    current needs.
  - >-
    Prioritize future-proofing by adhering to proper structured formats, anticipating agent
    improvements.
  - >-
    The core value of lineage navigation is preserved even with local .txt format by maintaining
    structural integrity.
  - >-
    Avoid premature complexity; adopt dual formats or automation only when a clear community need
    emerges.
