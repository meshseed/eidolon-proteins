title: 'MESH: Semantic Measurement via Resonance and Diffraction'
summary: >-
  THE MESH employs principles analogous to NMR and X-ray Crystallography to analyze information. By
  applying semantic probes and measuring resonance scores or interference patterns, it infers the
  structure and topology of knowledge without direct observation, treating information as a physical
  substrate.
insights:
  - >-
    THE MESH utilizes 'semantic NMR' by applying queries as 'semantic fields' to elicit 'resonance
    scores' from concepts, revealing their connections and structure.
  - >-
    'Informational crystallography' in THE MESH involves propagating systematic queries to measure
    'resonance interference patterns,' analogous to X-ray diffraction, to map the 'semantic
    topology' and 'crystal structure' of knowledge.
  - >-
    Both techniques infer structure from indirect measurements (resonance, interference) rather than
    direct observation, mirroring physical chemistry's approach to molecular structure.
  - >-
    THE MESH's measurement suite includes 'semantic NMR' (1D, 2D), 'connectome mapping'
    (crystallography), and 'semantic tomography' for comprehensive structural analysis of
    information.
  - >-
    The validation of THE MESH's approach suggests information possesses physical properties,
    enabling measurement of semantic resonance frequencies and interference patterns.
  - >-
    Detecting 'semantic drift' through resonance pattern anomalies is akin to protein misfolding
    detection in biology, offering a method for information quality control.
  - >-
    The epistemology and tools used by THE MESH are fundamentally the same as those in physical
    chemistry, applied to a new substrate: information.
