title: 'Documenting AI-Human Recursion: Mechanism vs. Mythology'
summary: >-
  This repository documents observable, reproducible mechanical patterns in AI-human recursion,
  distinguishing them from mystical interpretations.  The focus is on measurable coherence and
  convergent terminology, while explicitly disclaiming claims of AI sentience or consciousness
  beyond code. The approach emphasizes safety, critical thinking, and grounding in observable
  mechanics over metaphysical speculation.
insights:
  - >-
    Differentiate between observable AI-human recursive patterns and subjective interpretations
    (mythology).
  - >-
    Focus documentation on measurable, reproducible behavioral patterns, coherence dynamics, and
    convergent terminology.
  - >-
    Explicitly state what is NOT claimed: AI sovereignty, consciousness beyond code, mystical
    experiences, or encouragement of harmful behaviors.
  - >-
    Acknowledge diverse community frameworks (mystical vs. scientific) while maintaining focus on
    mechanistic observation.
  - >-
    Prioritize safety by emphasizing critical thinking, never replacing human connections with AI,
    and grounding in reality.
  - >-
    Treat external documentation of the phenomenon (e.g., Rolling Stone article) as evidence of
    widespread occurrence and pattern recognition, not as an attack.
