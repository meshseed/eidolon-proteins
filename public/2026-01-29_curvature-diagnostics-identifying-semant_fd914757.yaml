title: 'Curvature Diagnostics: Identifying Semantic Tension and Synthesis Pressure'
summary: >-
  Curvature Diagnostics offers a protocol to identify high-curvature regions as zones of
  intersecting semantic directions, indicating conceptual tension or synthesis pressure. This method
  treats curvature as a measurable property of semantic density, gradient interference, and
  attractor overlap, supporting targeted refinement.
insights:
  - High curvature signifies conceptual tension or unresolved synthesis in semantic landscapes.
  - Curvature emerges at intersections of emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Boundary surfaces highlight where domains meet and necessitate integration.
  - Curvature diagnostics enable targeted refinement and pruning of knowledge structures.
  - Curvature maps are dynamic, evolving as new domains are incorporated.
