title: 'Prime Numbers: Fundamental Building Blocks and Distribution'
summary: >-
  Prime numbers, defined as natural numbers greater than 1 with only two divisors (1 and
  themselves), are the irreducible building blocks of all integers via unique prime factorization.
  Their distribution, though seemingly random, exhibits profound patterns and has significant
  applications in cryptography and computer science.
insights:
  - Primes are the fundamental, irreducible building blocks of all integers.
  - >-
    The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees unique prime factorization for every integer >
    1.
  - >-
    Prime distribution is infinite but has arbitrarily large gaps, with patterns like twin primes
    and predictable approximations (Prime Number Theorem).
  - >-
    Special forms of primes (Mersenne, Fermat) and unsolved conjectures (Goldbach, Riemann
    Hypothesis) highlight ongoing mathematical exploration.
  - >-
    Primes are crucial for modern cryptography (RSA) and computer science applications like hash
    functions.
