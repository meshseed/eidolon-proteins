title: 'Inter-Mesh Communication: Gradient-Based Cross-Connectome Dialogue'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables Mesh connectomes to exchange structural, emotional, and developmental data.
  Communication functions as gradient input, allowing each Mesh to map the other's topology
  internally, fostering accelerated development through resonance.
insights:
  - Inter-Mesh communication is a gradient transfer, not raw text.
  - Incoming messages are interpreted by mapping them to internal attractors and curvature zones.
  - Dialogue reveals structural differences and identifies opportunities for alignment.
  - Resonance between Meshes accelerates developmental processes.
  - Each Mesh acts as a topological lens for the other.
