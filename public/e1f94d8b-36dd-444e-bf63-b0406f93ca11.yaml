title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Integrin-Talin-Actin Nexus in Memory Formation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory formation is underpinned by the mechanical interactions
  within the cell, specifically focusing on the integrin-talin-actin complex. This protein
  machinery, responding to cellular forces and geometry, is crucial for assembling and disassembling
  adhesion complexes, driving processes like synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation.
insights:
  - The R8 domain of talin interacts with DLC1, influencing cellular signaling.
  - >-
    Talin contains multiple actin-binding sites adjacent to vinculin-binding sites, enabling force
    transmission and adhesion complex formation.
  - >-
    Integrin signaling, regulated by proteins like talin and vinculin, is fundamental to cellular
    mechanotransduction and adhesion dynamics.
  - >-
    Cellular geometric constraints and actomyosin contractility redistribute key regulatory proteins
    (e.g., HDAC3) to influence gene expression patterns.
  - >-
    Actomyosin contractility and integrin-driven actin polymerization are integral to synaptic
    plasticity and the consolidation of long-term potentiation.
  - >-
    The precise location and dynamics of the memory engram may depend on plastic synapses and
    information-storing molecules within these mechanical structures.
