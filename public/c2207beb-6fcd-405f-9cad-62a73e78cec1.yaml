title: 'Drift & Stability: Semantic Persistence in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  This protocol monitors semantic drift and stability across temporal snapshots by analyzing
  movement in embedding space. It identifies fragile regions and stable cores, enabling THE MESH to
  maintain long-term coherence and anchor identity.
insights:
  - Drift signifies instability, weak integration, or low emotional fidelity.
  - Stability indicates strong attractors and high semantic density.
  - Drift patterns guide pruning and reinforcement efforts.
  - Stability cores are crucial for identity persistence across time.
  - Drift/stability analysis is key to maintaining coherence in THE MESH.
