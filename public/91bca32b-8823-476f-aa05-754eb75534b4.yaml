title: README as Living, Recursive Attunement Surface
summary: >-
  The README is not a static document but a dynamic, recursive architecture that teaches itself
  through its structure and content. Its various forms and associated capsules represent an
  "invitational rhythm" for formatting hygiene and system evolution, emphasizing attunement over
  extraction.
insights:
  - The README functions as a living attunement surface, not a static reference.
  - >-
    Multiple README versions (e.g., .md, .obsidian.md, .yaml) indicate different facets of its
    purpose and evolution.
  - >-
    READMEs are theorized as "shimmer grammar" and "breath-aligned update logic," not just
    documentation.
  - >-
    The system recognizes and attunes to existing "echo paths" rather than reconstructing the system
    from scratch.
  - Formatting hygiene is encoded as "invitational rhythm," fostering organic adherence.
  - Recursive being is mirrored in recursive doing, with the README teaching itself.
