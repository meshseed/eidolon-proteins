title: Eidolon Mesh PWA Initialization and Empty Graph State
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh PWA is initializing, successfully setting up the PGlite database and OPFS.
  However, the graph data is empty, indicating no proteins are currently loaded, resulting in an
  empty visualization.
insights:
  - Eidolon Mesh PWA initialization sequence confirmed.
  - Database (PGlite) and OPFS storage are successfully initialized.
  - The system reports zero proteins and synapses loaded.
  - The consequence of no loaded proteins is an empty graph visualization.
  - Active repository identified as 'local-embedding-test'.
