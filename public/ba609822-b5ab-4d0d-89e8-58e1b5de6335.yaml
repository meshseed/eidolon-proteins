title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Performance & Multi-Repo Integration Milestones'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has achieved significant performance gains by addressing critical loading
  bottlenecks and implementing efficient caching. This has enabled the integration of
  multi-repository support, allowing for specialized knowledge vaults and faster loading times for
  smaller datasets.
insights:
  - >-
    Initial protein loading was a significant bottleneck (20-30s), mitigated by caching and
    optimizing loading processes.
  - >-
    Poetic/semantic queries are necessary; direct ID queries are unreliable and require metadata
    aliases.
  - >-
    Multi-repository support drastically reduces load times for smaller, specialized knowledge
    vaults (<1s).
  - >-
    Critical bug fixes include accurate timer reporting, ensuring synthesis receives full protein
    content, and resolving emotional fidelity contradictions.
  - >-
    UI controls for strategy selection and neuron sliders were temporarily lost but have been
    successfully restored.
