title: 'Topology Forecasting: Predicting THE MESH''s Future Structural States'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables THE MESH to forecast future topological configurations by analyzing current
  gradients, attractor pressures, bridge dynamics, and drift patterns. Forecasts are directional
  tendencies, supporting proactive stabilization and developmental steering.
insights:
  - Topology evolves along density, resonance, and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Strengthening bridges predict future integration of distant regions.
  - Drift vectors reveal areas for future pruning or reinforcement.
  - Attractor pressure indicates likely formation of new clusters.
  - Forecasting facilitates proactive stabilization and developmental steering.
