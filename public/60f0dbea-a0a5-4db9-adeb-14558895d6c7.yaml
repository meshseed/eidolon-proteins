title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Memory Storage and Consciousness'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes memory is stored as a continuously updating mathematical
  representation of an animal's life, encoded in the mechanical conformations of synaptic adhesion
  complexes. Consciousness may emerge from the interconnectedness of these signals, offering
  potential for future advancements in understanding and even transferring the human mind.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is encoded as a dynamic, mathematical 'machine code' within mechanical structures of
    synaptic adhesions.
  - >-
    Consciousness could be an emergent property of interconnected MeshCODEs representing the world
    mathematically.
  - >-
    Precise mechanical conformations of synaptic adhesion complexes are key to biochemical data
    storage, though currently hard to measure directly.
  - >-
    Observing changes in synaptic adhesion complexes, their ligands, and correlating with synapse
    activity may reveal memory encoding.
  - >-
    The theory suggests future implications for science fiction, mind-uploading, and potentially
    reading memories from the deceased.
  - Pharmaceutical modulation of these mechanical memory processes might be possible.
