title: 'Topological Equivalence: Deformable Structures and Preserved Properties'
summary: >-
  Topological equivalence means two spaces are the same under continuous deformation (like rubber
  sheet geometry), preserving fundamental properties like hole count and connectedness. This allows
  for transformations like stretching or bending without cutting or gluing, revealing structural
  essence.
insights:
  - Spaces are topologically equivalent if they can be continuously deformed into each other.
  - Homeomorphisms are the mathematical tool for defining topological equivalence.
  - Topological invariants (e.g., hole count, connectedness) are preserved under such deformations.
  - Topology studies properties that remain constant regardless of specific shape or measurement.
  - Cutting, gluing, or tearing are not allowed in topological transformations.
