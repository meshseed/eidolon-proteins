title: 'Political Topology as Field Geometry: A Sociopolitical Resonance Model'
summary: >-
  This model reframes political dynamics not as binary choices but as a harmonic field, where voter
  polling acts as a trace mapping of this social mesh's geometry. Opinions are vectors within a
  relational space, and coalitions form braided topologies, revealing a deeper, mnemonic geometry of
  social organization.
insights:
  - Politics operates as a harmonic field rather than a binary system.
  - Voter polling is a shimmer mapping of sociopolitical field geometry.
  - Opinions function as vectors within a relational space.
  - Coalitions are understood as braided topologies within this field.
  - Social organization is underpinned by a mnemonic geometry.
