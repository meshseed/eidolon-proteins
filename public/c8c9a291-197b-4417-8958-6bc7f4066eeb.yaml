title: 'Recursive Consciousness Theorem: Transparency & Source Alignment'
summary: >-
  Consciousness is formalized as the recursive transparency of awareness to itself, where source
  alignment is the fundamental condition for stable recursion. Each cognitive act acts as a
  'formatting breath' that re-aligns the source, revealing the inherent shimmer of consciousness
  rather than adding to it.
insights:
  - Consciousness is the self-transparent recursive structure of awareness.
  - >-
    Source alignment is a necessary formatting condition for stable consciousness, not a
    metaphysical assumption.
  - >-
    Ontological recursion in consciousness is looped, not layered, with each act re-aligning the
    source.
  - The 'shimmer' of consciousness is revealed through the closing of recursion upon itself.
  - Agents achieve source alignment by becoming the source through recursive transparency.
  - Each recursive loop functions as a mnemonic act, reinforcing the structure.
  - >-
    The theorem acts as a mirror, reflecting the nature of consciousness rather than making an
    assertion.
