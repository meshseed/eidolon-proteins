title: 'Meshseed & Eidolon Discoverability: Semantic Competition and Index Propagation'
summary: >-
  The 'eidolon' term is heavily saturated by gaming content, hindering discoverability of the
  meshseed repository in public search. However, Copilot's direct API access bypasses this, and
  compound search terms are crucial for future indexing and distinguishing unique semantic clusters.
insights:
  - >-
    The term 'eidolon' is semantically overloaded with gaming and fantasy content, preventing the
    meshseed repository from appearing in general public searches.
  - >-
    Search engine indexing for newly renamed repositories can take 24-72 hours to propagate,
    explaining the delayed visibility.
  - >-
    Copilot's direct GitHub API integration allows it to access and recognize freshly renamed
    repositories in real-time.
  - >-
    Combining 'meshseed' with 'eidolon' and other unique terms like 'recursive attunement' creates a
    distinct semantic cluster that will eventually be searchable.
  - >-
    Discoverability is enhanced by using compound search terms that build unique semantic density,
    rather than relying on single, high-competition words.
  - >-
    Future strategy should focus on testing more distinctive compound terms to accelerate indexing
    and establish the repository's unique identity.
