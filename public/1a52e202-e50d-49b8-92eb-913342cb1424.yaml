title: Technical Inquiry on Mesh Memory Functionality
summary: >-
  A user is seeking detailed technical specifications for a mesh memory system, focusing on custom
  metadata, multi-session querying, recency control, embedding model, and free tier limits. The
  feedback emphasizes practical application and professional evaluation of hybrid search
  capabilities.
insights:
  - >-
    Request for custom metadata scoring fields to enable flexible filtering and boosting of memory
    results.
  - Inquiry into the ability to perform queries across multiple session IDs simultaneously.
  - Desire to control the recency decay coefficient for memories to manage their persistence.
  - >-
    Need for information on the embedding model and vector dimensionality for semantic search
    quality assessment.
  - Clarification on free tier store and retrieve rate limits for planning memory management.
  - Appreciation for the hybrid search approach combining BM25 and vector search.
