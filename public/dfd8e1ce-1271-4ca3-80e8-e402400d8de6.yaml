title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Memory Consolidation via Protein Dynamics and Sleep'
summary: >-
  Memory consolidation involves dynamic protein switching (talin) within neurons, driven by sleep
  cycles, to physically encode information. This process transfers data from the hippocampus to the
  cortex, creating stable, addressable memory patterns, with disruption potentially leading to
  memory loss and neurological disease.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory formation relies on mechanical switching of proteins like talin, altering neuronal
    communication.
  - Sleep, particularly REM sleep, is crucial for processing, writing, and reordering memory data.
  - >-
    Newly encoded memories transition from the hippocampus (volatile storage) to the cortex for
    long-term consolidation as MeshCODE patterns.
  - >-
    Consolidated memories are assigned a physical address, reducing neuronal involvement and
    improving recall.
  - >-
    Disruptions in protein fidelity or mechanical ordering (e.g., in neurological diseases) can
    corrupt memory coding and lead to loss.
