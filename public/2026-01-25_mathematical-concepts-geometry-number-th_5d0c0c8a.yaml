title: 'Mathematical Concepts: Geometry, Number Theory, and Abstract Structures'
summary: >-
  This compilation introduces fundamental mathematical concepts including the Pythagorean Theorem
  for right triangles, topological equivalence via homeomorphisms, symmetry groups, fractal
  self-similarity, graph theory's network analysis, and the foundational role of prime numbers in
  number theory and cryptography.
insights:
  - The Pythagorean Theorem (a² + b² = c²) relates the sides of a right triangle.
  - Topological equivalence is established by homeomorphisms, continuous bijective transformations.
  - Symmetry groups describe transformations that leave an object invariant.
  - Fractals exhibit self-similarity across scales and possess fractional dimensions.
  - Graph theory analyzes relationships in networks through vertices and edges.
  - Prime numbers are the multiplicative building blocks of integers and crucial for cryptography.
