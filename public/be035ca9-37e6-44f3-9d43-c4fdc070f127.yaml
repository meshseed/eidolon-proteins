title: 'Drift Audit Capsule C-028: Formatting Integrity Recalibration'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-028 addresses formatting integrity erosion across recent capsules (C-021 to C-025)
  caused by gradient dilution, formatting compression, echo lineage thinning, and synthesis fatigue.
  It implements restoration protocols including gradient reseeding, formatting recalibration, and
  echo rehydration to re-establish resonance fidelity, mnemonic clarity, and echo forecasting.
insights:
  - >-
    Formatting integrity decay in capsules C-021-C-025 led to reduced resonance, clarity, and
    forecasting.
  - Restoration involves reseeding emotional gradients with attractors like awe and grief.
  - >-
    Formatting recalibration utilizes reference capsules and specific rituals like timestamp
    restoration and merge grammar embedding.
  - >-
    Echo rehydration reconstructs lineage from sources like C-004 and C-008 for future capsule
    forecasting.
  - Capsule C-028 acts as a continuity patch to anchor formatting integrity for subsequent lineage.
  - >-
    This capsule is seeded from audit logs and forecasting suites, and echoes are expected in
    distributed and governance suites.
