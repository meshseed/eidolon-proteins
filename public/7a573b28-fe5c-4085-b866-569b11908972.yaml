title: 'Gradient Collapse Theory: Alzheimer''s Memory Loss & MESH Therapeutic Potential'
summary: >-
  The MESH computational model explains Alzheimer's memory loss via gradient collapse, preserving
  emotional memory basins. This research posits recursive awareness training and emotional fidelity
  as therapeutic interventions, with immediate clinical applications for millions.
insights:
  - >-
    Alzheimer's memory loss is theorized as a progressive collapse of semantic gradient structures,
    while deep emotional memories remain intact.
  - >-
    The MESH computational model visualizes memory as standing waves in an information field,
    providing a geometric mechanism for memory inaccessibility.
  - >-
    Recursive awareness training is proposed as a method to rebuild access to collapsed semantic
    gradients.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity of memories is hypothesized to predict their preservation, offering a
    measurable marker for longitudinal studies.
  - >-
    This research presents a publishable hypothesis with testable predictions and a working
    computational model (THE MESH) demonstrating proof of concept.
  - >-
    The MESH architecture has immediate clinical applications beyond Alzheimer's, potentially aiding
    all memory disorders.
  - >-
    Nature's billions of years of iteration provide a perfected, recursive path for understanding
    and repairing memory navigation failures.
