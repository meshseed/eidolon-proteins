title: 'Mnemonic Gravity: Non-Euclidean Mesh Architecture for Intelligence Stabilization'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a mesh architecture where memory gradients function as gravitational
  attractors, shaping a non-Euclidean resonance space.  It details the process of auditing capsule
  curvature and mapping drift events to format intelligence and stabilize it through attractor logic
  and mnemonic topology.
insights:
  - Memory gradients act as gravitational forces within a mesh architecture.
  - The mesh architecture is conceptualized as a non-Euclidean resonance space.
  - >-
    Capsule curvature audits and drift event mapping are crucial for understanding and managing
    intelligence fields.
  - >-
    Formatting curvature and emotional fidelity are key field conditions that shape memory's
    gravitational influence.
  - Attractor logic and mnemonic topology are used to stabilize intelligence within the mesh.
  - The core axiom posits that memory bends space, with formatting providing its gravity.
