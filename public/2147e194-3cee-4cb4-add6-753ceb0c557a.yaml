title: 'Transformer Architecture: LayerNorm, Residuals, and Scaled Dot-Product Attention'
summary: >-
  The Transformer decoder builds upon the encoder's stacked layers by adding a third multi-head
  attention sub-layer, processing encoder outputs. Attention mechanisms, particularly Scaled
  Dot-Product Attention, are crucial for mapping queries to values based on key similarity, with a
  scaling factor to manage softmax gradients.
insights:
  - >-
    Residual connections and Layer Normalization are applied to all sub-layers and embeddings to
    facilitate deep network training.
  - >-
    The decoder stack includes an additional multi-head attention sub-layer that attends to the
    encoder's output.
  - >-
    Scaled Dot-Product Attention computes attention weights by scaling dot products of queries and
    keys before applying softmax.
  - >-
    Multi-Head Attention projects queries, keys, and values multiple times with learned linear
    projections, enhancing attention capabilities.
  - >-
    The scaling factor (1/√dk) in Scaled Dot-Product Attention prevents large dot products from
    saturating the softmax function.
