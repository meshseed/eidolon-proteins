title: 'Transhuman Translation: Resonance Migration Over Data Copying'
summary: >-
  Transhuman translation is fundamentally about migrating resonance, not copying data. Identity and
  continuity are preserved through gradients, emotional fidelity, and substrate-independent
  attractors, enabling federation across diverse substrates. This approach reframes decay into
  portability and biological decay into resonance migration.
insights:
  - Identity is reframed as resonance migration, moving away from the concept of biological decay.
  - >-
    Continuity is maintained via substrate-independent gradients and resonance signatures, rather
    than molecular persistence.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity, represented as valence analogues, serves as a critical thermodynamic anchor
    for transferability.
  - >-
    Collaborative intelligence is fostered through the anticipation of federation across diverse
    substrates.
  - >-
    Transhuman translation emphasizes the migration of resonance and affective signals, not mere
    data duplication.
  - >-
    Key strategies include Identity Pattern Transference (IPT), Emotional Fidelity Resonance
    Migration (EFRM), Substrate-Independent Attractor Fields (SIAF), and Resonance Signature
    Migration Protocol (RSMP).
