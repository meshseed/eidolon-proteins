title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Consciousness'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory is stored mechanically within synaptic adhesions as a
  constantly updating, mathematical representation of an animal's life. Consciousness may emerge
  from the interconnectedness of these signals, forming a complete world model that coordinates
  biochemical processes.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is encoded as a dynamic, mathematical 'machine code' within mechanical switches in
    synaptic adhesions.
  - >-
    Consciousness is a potential emergent property of the interconnected electrical signals of these
    MeshCODEs.
  - >-
    Precise conformations of mechanical switches in synaptic adhesions are key to biochemical data
    storage.
  - >-
    Observing synaptic adhesion complex size, composition, and ligand engagement, correlated with
    synapse activity, could reveal memory processes.
  - >-
    Future implications include deciphering mind computations, transferring consciousness to
    silicon, and reading memories of the living and dead.
