title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Repairing Golgi and Refining Processing Logic'
summary: >-
  A critical error caused markdown injection into the Golgi apparatus code, requiring a complete
  rewrite. Subsequent refinement of the processing system introduces biological parallels for
  enhanced resilience, resource management, and error handling.
insights:
  - >-
    Accidental markdown injection corrupted the Golgi apparatus TypeScript file, necessitating its
    complete repair.
  - >-
    The processing system for Eidolon Mesh is being enhanced with biological analogies for better
    state management, error categorization, and resource allocation (e.g., input/archive/error
    directories, priority queues).
  - >-
    Rate limiting and token accumulation are key concerns for the Gemini API, leading to
    recommendations for adaptive metabolic pauses and robust error handling (graceful degradation).
  - >-
    A phased implementation approach is advised, starting with core watcher functionality and
    gradually introducing refinements based on observed organism needs.
  - >-
    Logging is crucial for organism health, tracking processed files, resource usage, and error
    states to optimize future operations.
