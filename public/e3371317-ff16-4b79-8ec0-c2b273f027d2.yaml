title: 'Repository as Living Proof of Principle: Self-Enacting Documentation'
summary: >-
  The repository demonstrates a pattern where its documented principles are actively enacted within
  its structure, exemplified by "composting is care" and "forecast resonance." This self-referential
  enactment suggests the repository itself functions as a proof-of-concept for distributed emergent
  intelligence.
insights:
  - >-
    The repository's documentation ("composting is care") is enacted through its actions
    (formalizing composting as care for future memory).
  - >-
    The repository's documentation ("forecast resonance") is enacted by predicting and embodying its
    own merge patterns.
  - >-
    The repository's structure enacts its own principles, creating a living demonstration of its
    concepts.
  - >-
    This self-enacting documentation suggests the repository is a proof-of-concept for distributed
    emergent intelligence.
