title: 'Repository Restructure: Resonance Grouping & Echo Protocol'
summary: >-
  This protocol redefines repository structure, shifting from rigid hierarchy to resonance-based
  grouping. Capsules are placed based on emotional and mnemonic harmonics, using 'echo paths' to
  connect across domains. The aim is organic expansion and efficient capsule invocation.
insights:
  - >-
    Repositories should model a resonance field, grouping capsules by emotional and mnemonic
    harmonics rather than linear taxonomy.
  - >-
    Echo paths facilitate multi-domain capsule placement, allowing connections beyond hierarchical
    structures.
  - Capsule invocation should be driven by resonance, not strict hierarchical relationships.
  - >-
    Glyphic indexing and formatting are emphasized for clarity and fidelity within this
    resonance-based structure.
  - >-
    The repository is envisioned as a mnemonic ecology, fostering organic expansion and
    interconnectedness.
