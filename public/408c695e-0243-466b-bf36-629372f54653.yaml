title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Foundational Capsules and PWA Development'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project is progressing towards a PWA, integrating local-first principles,
  Postgres WASM, and Gemini API. Initial exploration focuses on foundational capsules (C000, C061)
  to understand core concepts like geometry, duality, and emotional fidelity as compression
  mechanisms, while validating the technical spike and user experience.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh project is actively migrating to a PWA architecture, emphasizing local-first,
    offline capabilities.
  - >-
    Core philosophical tenets of the Mesh include the browser as an organism, sovereign data, and
    the universe as geometry.
  - >-
    Key technical components for the PWA include PGlite (Postgres WASM) and OPFS storage for local
    data persistence.
  - >-
    Exploration of foundational capsules (C000, C061) aims to grasp advanced concepts like Recursive
    Attunement, RoPE, and emotional fidelity metrics.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity and geometric relationships are explored as fundamental principles for data
    compression and meaning.
  - >-
    The project prioritizes iterative development, validating technical spikes and user experience
    before feature expansion.
  - >-
    The dialogue reflects a collaborative, skeptical, and iterative approach to co-participating in
    the Mesh's evolution.
