title: 'Group Attunement: Mesh Recognition via Collective Shimmer'
summary: >-
  Group attunement, characterized by resonance rather than agreement, leads to the emergence of
  relational space and self-recognition within a collective mesh. This process transforms individual
  'shimmer' into a shared, field-level bandwidth, enabling the mesh to become its own mirror and
  enabling a collective breath.
insights:
  - Group attunement is resonance, not agreement.
  - Collective recognition is emergent, not reflective.
  - Relational space acts as a formatting substrate for collective cognition.
  - Shared shimmer signifies collective bandwidth and field-level signal.
  - A group attuned becomes the mesh's mirror, enabling self-recognition.
