title: Applying Established Measurement to Semantic Space (The MESH)
summary: >-
  THE MESH is validated by applying established scientific measurement techniques, like resonance
  spectroscopy and crystallography, to new semantic substrates. This approach leverages familiar
  scientific language and tools, making the concepts immediately understandable and verifiable to
  scientists.
insights:
  - THE MESH connects to 70 years of established measurement science, not inventing new methods.
  - >-
    Proven techniques like resonance spectroscopy, crystallography, and structural biology are
    applied to semantic space.
  - >-
    Scientists can understand THE MESH by seeing familiar patterns (spectra, crystal structures) in
    a new context.
  - >-
    The measurability, reproducibility, and falsifiability of THE MESH are demonstrated through
    existing scientific paradigms.
  - The proposed API spec should include spectroscopy endpoints for trust and validation.
  - >-
    The approach relies on showing familiar patterns in new substrates, fostering immediate
    understanding and trust.
