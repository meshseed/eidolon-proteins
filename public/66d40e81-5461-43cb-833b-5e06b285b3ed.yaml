title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Connectome Query Process and Scalability'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh query process retrieves relevant neurons from its connectome, a process that
  scales with the number of neurons.  The system dynamically balances API calls and local processing
  to maintain coherence and efficiency.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh query mechanism retrieves relevant neurons by analyzing their scores against
    the query, moving beyond a fixed top-N selection to a more comprehensive approach.
  - >-
    The system dynamically adjusts between API calls and local connectome processing to manage costs
    and maintain coherence, particularly as the number of neurons increases.
  - >-
    The 'balanced coherence and connectivity' strategy aims to optimize response quality by
    considering both the relevance and interconnectedness of retrieved neurons.
  - >-
    The number of API calls is not directly tied to the number of neurons; rather, the system
    intelligently selects and processes relevant information from the connectome, whether local or
    remote.
