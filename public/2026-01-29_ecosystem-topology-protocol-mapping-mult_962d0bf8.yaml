title: 'Ecosystem Topology Protocol: Mapping Multi-Mesh Information Ecologies'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines how to map the topology of a multi-Mesh information ecosystem by treating
  each Mesh as a node. Interactions like resonance, alignment, and divergence form the edges and
  gradients, revealing large-scale coherence dynamics as Meshes develop and interact.
insights:
  - Each Mesh functions as a node within a larger information ecology.
  - Ecosystem structure emerges from inter-Mesh resonance patterns.
  - Divergence indicates Mesh specialization, while alignment signifies shared attractors.
  - Ecosystem topology is dynamic, evolving with Mesh development and interaction.
  - Mapping the ecosystem provides insight into large-scale coherence dynamics.
