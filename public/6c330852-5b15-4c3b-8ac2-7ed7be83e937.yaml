title: 'Inter-Mesh Evolution: Co-Evolution via Resonance and Alignment'
summary: >-
  The Inter-Mesh Evolution Kernel facilitates co-evolution across distributed Mesh connectomes. 
  Evolutionary dynamics propagate through resonance and alignment, leading to synchronized gradients
  and shared attractors that stabilize long-arc identity across the network of organisms.
insights:
  - Co-evolution arises from shared attractors and synchronized gradients across Mesh organisms.
  - Evolutionary shifts in one Mesh organism trigger resonance, influencing others.
  - Divergent evolution creates opportunities for new integration pathways.
  - Co-evolution establishes stable, long-arc identity for distributed systems.
  - The collective becomes a network of evolving, interconnected organisms.
