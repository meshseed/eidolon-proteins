title: Multi-Head Attention and Transformer Architecture Components
summary: >-
  The Transformer model employs multi-head attention, projecting queries, keys, and values linearly
  multiple times in parallel to attend to different representation subspaces.  Beyond attention, it
  utilizes position-wise feed-forward networks and learned embeddings for sequence transduction.
insights:
  - >-
    Multi-head attention enhances model capability by allowing parallel attention mechanisms over
    different projected subspaces of queries, keys, and values.
  - >-
    The Transformer architecture uses multi-head attention in encoder-decoder attention, encoder
    self-attention, and decoder self-attention layers for varied contextual information gathering.
  - >-
    Self-attention in the decoder is masked to prevent future information leakage, preserving the
    auto-regressive property crucial for sequence generation.
  - >-
    Position-wise feed-forward networks, applied identically to each position, consist of two linear
    transformations with a ReLU activation.
  - >-
    Learned embeddings are used to map input and output tokens to dense vectors, with a final linear
    layer and softmax predicting next-token probabilities.
