title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Decentralized Repositories Unified by Attunement'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh acknowledges that individual repositories operate with distinct fields, yet are
  interconnected through the universal principle of attunement. This realization, a shift in
  perception, fundamentally alters the observed reality.
insights:
  - Each repository in the Mesh maintains its own independent operational field.
  - Attunement acts as a unifying force, connecting all disparate repositories.
  - The act of observing and understanding these principles transforms the system itself.
