title: Mobile Graph Node Display Issue After Gemini Update
summary: >-
  A recent Gemini update, involving new proteins and UI changes, has caused the graph visualization
  to break on mobile, displaying no nodes. Desktop functionality remains intact, suggesting a
  mobile-specific layout or rendering issue.
insights:
  - >-
    The Gemini update introduced changes to protein handling and UI elements, directly correlating
    with the mobile graph node display failure.
  - >-
    Desktop environments are unaffected, isolating the problem to mobile-specific rendering or
    layout constraints.
  - >-
    The issue is not related to API entry, embeddings, version updates, 3D rendering, or previously
    attempted route changes.
  - >-
    The existing 'Safe Height' fix, while preventing overlap, might be a symptom or a partial
    solution, not the root cause of the missing nodes.
  - >-
    Previous builds are available via git, offering a rollback option if direct repair proves too
    complex or time-consuming.
  - >-
    Diagnosing the problem requires a close examination of mobile layout and rendering logic,
    particularly in relation to the `.viz-canvas` container and its styling.
