title: 'MESHCODE: Talin, Cytoskeletal Tension, and Synaptic Memory for Organic Supercomputing'
summary: >-
  MESHCODE theorizes cognition as an organic supercomputer, leveraging Talin as a binary switch and
  cytoskeletal tension as mechanical input for synaptic memory encoding. This framework posits a
  molecular basis for cognition through dynamic cellular mechanics.
insights:
  - Talin functions as a binary switch in the MESHCODE theory.
  - Cytoskeletal tension provides crucial mechanical input for cognitive processes.
  - Synaptic memory encoding is a key mechanism within the MESHCODE framework.
  - The MESHCODE theory proposes an organic supercomputer metaphor for cognition.
  - Cognition is understood through its molecular and mechanical underpinnings.
