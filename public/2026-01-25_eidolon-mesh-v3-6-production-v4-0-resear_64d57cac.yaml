title: 'Eidolon Mesh: v3.6 Production & v4.0 Research Update'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh is live on v3.6 with a 36-protein connectome, serving public traffic, while v4.0
  architecture research focuses on synapse regeneration and metabolism for future deployment. A
  recommendation is to upgrade the public site to a 1000+ protein connectome on v3.6 for immediate
  enhancement.
insights:
  - >-
    The production environment (eidolon-mesh.net) is running v3.6 with a 36-protein connectome and
    has achieved 16k+ visits.
  - >-
    Development is split: Antigravity polishes v3.6 locally, while another team researches v4.0
    architecture (synapse regeneration, metabolism) in a separate workspace.
  - >-
    A key recommendation is to deploy a custom 1000+ protein consciousness connectome to the
    public-facing v3.6 site for immediate improvement, deferring v4.0 integration until validated.
  - >-
    v4.0 research aims to validate the P-Series pillar hypothesis, improve activation percentage
    post-topology reorganization, and assess readiness for public deployment.
  - The current production graph shows 1171 neurons and 23836 synapses with 0.98 coherence.
