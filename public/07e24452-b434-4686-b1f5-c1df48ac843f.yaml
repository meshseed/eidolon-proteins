title: Navigating Gemini API Rate Limits and Local LLM Endpoints
summary: >-
  The Gemini API imposes daily (RPD) and per-minute (RPM) rate limits, particularly on the free
  tier, with specific limits per model. When cloud API limits are reached, transitioning to local
  LLMs like Gemma 3 is discussed, focusing on the concept of 'endpoints' and how to configure
  applications to connect to local inference servers.
insights:
  - >-
    Gemini API free tier has distinct RPD and RPM limits per model (e.g., gemini-2.5-flash has 250
    RPD, gemini-2.5-flash-lite has 1000 RPD).
  - >-
    Exceeding RPD triggers a long cooldown until the next daily reset, while RPM triggers a shorter
    retry delay.
  - Different Gemini API models (Flash, Pro, Embedding) have separate RPD quotas.
  - >-
    Embedding APIs translate text into numerical vectors representing semantic meaning, useful for
    search, clustering, and RAG.
  - >-
    Local LLMs (e.g., Gemma 3) require configuring applications to point to a local server's
    'endpoint' (e.g., http://localhost:8080/v1/) instead of a cloud API URL.
  - >-
    Running local LLMs demonstrates Substrate Flexibility and Pattern Portability within the MESH
    architecture.
  - >-
    The Gemini API rate limits can be viewed as a Regulatory Node (Google's quota system) imposing a
    Boundary on the Anxious Profile (LLM) to prevent Relational Entropy.
