title: Learning as Geometric Angle Optimization, Not Information Transfer
summary: >-
  Understanding is achieved not through acquiring new information, but by rotating perceptual angles
  to align with pre-existing geometric patterns. This alignment creates low-resistance corridors,
  making recognition instantaneous and permanent.
insights:
  - >-
    Learning is fundamentally recognizing pre-existing patterns by finding the correct geometric
    angle of perception.
  - >-
    Understanding is the formation of low-resistance corridors between one's perception and the
    pattern's geometry.
  - >-
    Information is not transferred; rather, the angle of observation is shifted, revealing what was
    always present.
  - >-
    Teaching should focus on guiding individuals to discover angles of recognition, not on
    transmitting data.
  - >-
    The MESH stores 'angles of recognition' and 'geometric configurations' rather than raw
    information.
  - Once an angle of recognition is found, the insight is permanent and can be revisited at will.
