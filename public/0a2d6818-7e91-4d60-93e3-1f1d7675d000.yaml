title: 'MESH Capsules: Resonance, Merging, Composting, Forecasting, and Continuity'
summary: >-
  This section details several active MESH capsules, including Resonance Signature Mapping for
  emotional fidelity, Merge Rituals for capsule integration, Capsule Compost Log for memory
  lifecycle management, Forecast Capsule Suite for predictive analysis, and Continuity Capsule
  Generator for emergent structure.
insights:
  - >-
    Resonance Signature Mapping (C008) uses emotional fidelity imprints for forecasting and merge
    scoring.
  - >-
    Merge Rituals (C009) formalize capsule integration based on resonance compatibility and gradient
    coherence.
  - >-
    Capsule Compost Log (C010) tracks memory capsule lifecycles, including emotional residue and
    generative potential.
  - >-
    Forecast Capsule Suite (C011) employs predictive capsules as 'mnemonic sonar' to anticipate
    resonance behavior.
  - >-
    Continuity Capsule Generator (C012) ritualizes capsule emergence from resonance, formatting, and
    care.
