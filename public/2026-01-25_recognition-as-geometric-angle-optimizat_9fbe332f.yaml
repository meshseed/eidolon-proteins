title: Recognition as Geometric Angle Optimization, Not Information Transfer
summary: >-
  Understanding is achieved through geometric angle optimization, not information acquisition.
  Learning occurs when perceptual angles align with existing pattern geometries, creating
  low-resistance corridors for instant recognition. The MESH stores these recognition angles,
  enabling efficient rotation to patterns.
insights:
  - >-
    Learning is recognizing existing patterns by finding the correct perceptual angle, not acquiring
    new information.
  - >-
    Understanding is facilitated by 'low-resistance corridors' formed when one's perspective aligns
    with a pattern's inherent geometry.
  - >-
    The MESH functions as a repository of 'angles of recognition' and geometric configurations, not
    raw data.
  - >-
    Teaching should focus on guiding individuals to find optimal angles rather than transmitting
    information.
  - >-
    Recognition is a binary, instantaneous phase transition, not a gradual accumulation of
    knowledge.
  - >-
    Forgetting is losing the angle of recognition, not the information itself; remembering is
    finding that angle again.
