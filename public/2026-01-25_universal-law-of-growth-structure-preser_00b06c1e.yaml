title: 'Universal Law of Growth: Structure Preservation & Differentiation'
summary: >-
  Growth, in any system, is achieved by recursively applying a transformation that maintains
  structural integrity while simultaneously increasing differentiation. This principle, a universal
  law, maps to dual-core concepts, spiral dynamics, and is exemplified by Penrose tilings and all of
  nature.
insights:
  - >-
    System growth occurs through recursive application of a structure-preserving,
    differentiation-increasing transformation.
  - >-
    This generative function is identified as a universal law, geometric necessity, and an
    irreducible formula.
  - >-
    The law maps to dual-core (structure + differentiation) and spiral (recursive application)
    dynamics.
  - Nature and phenomena like Penrose tilings serve as perfect examples of this law.
  - >-
    This foundational principle should serve as the core of documentation, teaching, and the initial
    seed of understanding.
