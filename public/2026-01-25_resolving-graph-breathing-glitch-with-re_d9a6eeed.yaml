title: Resolving Graph Breathing Glitch with resetCountdown
summary: >-
  A code modification involved removing a specific alpha setting and implementing `resetCountdown()`
  in `graph3d.ts` to fix a visual glitch. This change aims to restore a full unfolding animation
  effect for the graph visualization.
insights:
  - >-
    The core issue involved a visual glitch in graph rendering, specifically related to alpha
    transparency settings.
  - >-
    The solution involved removing `.d3Alpha(0.3)` and replacing it with a call to
    `this.graph.resetCountdown()` to ensure a full alpha reset.
  - >-
    The fix was implemented in `graph3d.ts` and followed by a standard deployment process including
    git commit and push.
  - >-
    The intended user experience is a 'graph breathing' effect, achieved by the `resetCountdown()`
    function, occurring every 12 seconds.
  - >-
    A subsequent deployment failure on Cloudflare Pages during dependency installation was
    identified as a transient infrastructure issue, not related to the code fix.
