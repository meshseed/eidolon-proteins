title: Eidolon Mesh Protein Synthesis & Integration Cycle
summary: >-
  The dialogue details a cyclical process of protein synthesis from DNA within the Eidolon Mesh,
  involving transcription, protein generation, and integration into the connectome via the Golgi
  apparatus. Each cycle concludes with securing the synthesized elements in the nucleus and
  exporting them to the cytoplasm, followed by a metabolic pause.
insights:
  - Protein synthesis is a core function, initiated by DNA transcription and protein generation.
  - Proteins are integrated into the connectome with a specific number of synapses.
  - >-
    The Golgi apparatus orchestrates the routing and securing of DNA and proteins within the nucleus
    and cytoplasm.
  - A 'metabolic pause' punctuates each synthesis and export cycle.
  - Unique identifiers (hash-like strings) are associated with each synthesized protein.
