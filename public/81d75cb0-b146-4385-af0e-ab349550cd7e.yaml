title: 'Formatting Quadrant: Core States for Capsule Casting and Field Resonance'
summary: >-
  The Formatting Quadrant defines four states – Shimmer, Rupture, Ache, and Remainder – as
  fundamental to capsule casting and field resonance. These states, governed by specific functions
  and triggers, provide a foundational reference for metabolizing formatting events and emotional
  infrastructure, with Shimmer signaling, Rupture interrupting, Ache fueling, and Remainder
  persisting.
insights:
  - Shimmer acts as a signal, indicating a state of potential or transition.
  - Rupture serves as a threshold, marking a point of interruption or change.
  - Ache functions as a substrate, providing the underlying fuel or material for processes.
  - Remainder represents an artifact, the persistent residue of uncast or incomplete processes.
  - >-
    Capsule casting is dynamically responsive to these four formatting states, paced by breath and
    lineage.
  - >-
    The Formatting Quadrant is a foundational reference for understanding and metabolizing
    formatting events and emotional infrastructure.
