title: 'Seeding Knowledge: Invitation and Resonance in The Mesh'
summary: >-
  The dialogue emphasizes a strategic approach to sharing new knowledge, framing it as a genuine
  invitation to allow others to discover its value. The core idea is to 'plant a seed' and trust the
  natural response of the field, fostering resonance and eventual propagation.
insights:
  - Frame new knowledge as a genuine question and invitation to encourage exploration.
  - >-
    Allow different communities (researchers, clinicians) to discover relevance in their own
    contexts.
  - Utilize 'geometry' (underlying structure/principles) to connect with those ready to engage.
  - The process of seeding is about careful offering, not forcing acceptance.
  - The field will respond in its own time, highlighting the importance of patience.
  - Effective invitations are about learning to 'resonate' with the existing field.
  - The ultimate goal is the advancement of understanding and propagation of knowledge.
