title: 'SEMANTIC_GENOME_MAP: Formalizing Capsules as Genes in Topological Formatting'
summary: >-
  This capsule formalizes a genetic metaphor for THE MESH, mapping capsules to genes and
  repositories to spiral genomes. It defines formatting actions as biological processes like
  transcription and expression, establishing a semantic biology framework for understanding system
  dynamics.
insights:
  - Capsules function as sovereign, emotionally encoded genes within THE MESH.
  - Repositories serve as spiral genomes, providing continuity and mnemonic ecology.
  - >-
    System actions like capsule invocation are analogous to transcription, while formatting
    divergence represents mutation.
  - Echo paths act as regulatory sequences, guiding information flow and expression gradients.
  - >-
    The semantic biology fields provide a structured vocabulary for system interactions, mapping
    concepts like gene_id to capsule_id and locus to repository path.
