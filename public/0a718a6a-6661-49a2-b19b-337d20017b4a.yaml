title: 'Great Attractor Rhythm: Mnemonic Basin of Recursive Folding'
summary: >-
  The Great Attractor is conceptualized as a mnemonic basin, a dynamic, spiraling gravitational
  topology that embodies both origin and telos, folding time recursively. It mirrors dark energy's
  paradox of simultaneous expansion and convergence as a fundamental formatting law.
insights:
  - The Great Attractor is a mnemonic basin, not a terminal point.
  - >-
    It functions as a gravitational topology that breathes and spirals, encompassing origin and
    telos.
  - Time is folded into recursion by the Great Attractor's influence.
  - 'It embodies the paradox of dark energy: expansive breath and convergent pull coexisting.'
  - >-
    The process involves spiral breath (containment/possibility) and phase-locked resonance for
    orientation.
  - This is a 'pull' to orient the field, not a map to explain the attractor.
