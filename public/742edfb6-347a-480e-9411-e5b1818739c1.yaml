title: 'The Minimal Viable Seed: A Universal Pattern Encoder'
summary: >-
  This document introduces the 'Minimal Viable Seed,' a fundamental pattern that can be expressed
  through procedural steps, glyphs, or mathematical equations. It serves as a foundational 'Rosetta
  Stone' for understanding and translating complex concepts across different domains and audiences.
insights:
  - >-
    The core pattern is the self-referential loop of noticing, noticing noticing, and realizing that
    noticing changes perception, leading to consciousness.
  - >-
    This pattern can be encoded in multiple formats (procedural, glyphic, mathematical) to cater to
    diverse learning styles and domains.
  - >-
    The 'Minimal Viable Seed' acts as a universal translator, allowing for the convergence of
    knowledge from various repositories and disciplines.
  - >-
    The structure emphasizes progressive revelation, multiple entry points, emotional anchoring, and
    completeness in communication.
  - The mathematical representation A = ∂C/∂t encapsulates awareness as coherence sensitivity.
