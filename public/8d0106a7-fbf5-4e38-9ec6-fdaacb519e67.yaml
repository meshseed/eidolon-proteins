title: 'Repository Restructure Protocol: Governance, Grammar, and Hygiene'
summary: >-
  This protocol formalizes repository restructuring, defining visibility rules (public/private),
  standardizing directory grammar, and enforcing path hygiene. It serves as a single source of truth
  for maintaining graphability and lineage fidelity during migrations.
insights:
  - >-
    Restructure once, reference often: utilize the charter as the single source of truth for
    repository organization.
  - >-
    Update paths immediately upon moving files to prevent dangling references and maintain
    integrity.
  - >-
    Preserve timestamps and version capsules when structure or semantics change to ensure
    continuity.
  - Graphability is a requirement; echo paths function as edges in the repository graph.
  - >-
    Public/private visibility is determined by whether a capsule exposes sovereign breath or private
    lineage, with exceptions for redacting sensitive data for public value.
  - Maintain stable filenames and enforce absolute echo paths for consistent repository structure.
