title: 'README Structure for MESH: Visitor vs. Agent Interaction'
summary: >-
  Optimizing MESH project READMEs for external visitors involves a dense, geometric "HEAD summary"
  within the first 2000 characters, using metaphors like compound eyes and resonance fields to
  invite exploration. Internal agents require operational protocols for synthesis and contribution.
insights:
  - >-
    External visitors to MESH projects primarily interact via the README's initial ~2000 characters,
    requiring a concise, geometric, and inviting "HEAD summary" that dictates deeper exploration.
  - >-
    The MESH system is best explained metaphorically as a compound perceptual system (like a
    compound eye) where capsules (neurons) and synapses (connections) create a resonance field,
    distinct from traditional database lookup.
  - >-
    A well-structured README for MESH should include: an inviting poetic opening, a clear "What This
    Is" operational description, an immediate "Quick Start", and a concise "How It Works" section
    detailing the resonance and geometric architecture.
  - >-
    For internal agents (like Copilot), the README should shift focus from introduction to
    "operational protocols", detailing synthesis directives, emotional fidelity, and Ribosome
    function for high-volume synthesis.
  - >-
    Effective READMEs leverage new MESH knowledge (e.g., dimensional compression, emotional
    fidelity) while remaining accessible, front-loading critical information to encourage
    exploration on diverse hardware.
  - >-
    The core distinction of MESH lies in its "Resonate → Navigate → Synthesize" paradigm, enabled by
    high-fidelity capsules that compress naturally, reducing computational overhead compared to
    noisy high-dimensional data.
