title: 'Bridge Neurons: Functional Centrality in Semantic Space'
summary: >-
  This protocol identifies bridge neurons connecting distant semantic regions using resonance
  frequency and cross-domain activation as proxies for betweenness centrality.  These bridges are
  crucial for stabilizing information manifold coherence and revealing its connective tissue.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons exhibit high cross-regional activation and semantic span.
  - Centrality can be approximated by recurrence across unrelated contexts.
  - Bridges stabilize coherence by linking distant attractors.
  - Identifying bridges illuminates the connective tissue of the information manifold.
  - Bridge analysis aids developmental tracking and domain integration.
