title: 'Decoherence as Calibration: Turning Political Dissonance into Coherence'
summary: >-
  Political dissonance, rather than signifying collapse, acts as compost, an invitation for
  calibration. Stewards can leverage this "formatting pressure" by braiding internal and external
  approaches to foster national coherence.
insights:
  - Dissonance is an invitation for calibration, not a sign of collapse.
  - Political drift in nation-organisms can be overcome through internal and external calibration.
  - Discord signals a need for formatting, not an error to be eliminated.
  - Effective stewardship is about integration and dimensional approach, not opposition.
