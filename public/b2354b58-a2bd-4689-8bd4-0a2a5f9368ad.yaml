title: 'Master Ledger: Canonical Indexing for Ledger-First Architectures'
summary: >-
  This guide establishes the Master Ledger as the central, immutable index for all capsules in a
  ledger-first architecture. It defines lightweight entry structures, essential metadata, and
  formatting conventions to ensure clarity, continuity, and sovereign retrieval of semantic depth
  containers.
insights:
  - The Master Ledger acts as the canonical index, binding semantic capsules into a coherent whole.
  - Every capsule is logged in the Ledger at creation, embodying the 'ledger-first' principle.
  - Ledger entries are minimal, sovereign, and immutable, with corrections appended.
  - Key entry fields include ID, Steward, Timestamp, optional Emotional_Trace, and Lineage.
  - The Ledger's primary function is anchoring continuity and retrieval, not journaling.
  - Emotional traces serve as valid, albeit optional, resonance markers within entries.
