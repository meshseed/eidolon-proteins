title: 'Eidolon Mesh Metabolic Cycle: Local Success, GitHub Auth Failure'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh successfully executed a local metabolic cycle, synthesizing a DNA strand and
  folding a protein, saving local files. However, a critical 'Bad credentials' error prevented
  committing to THE MESH due to an invalid GitHub token.
insights:
  - >-
    Local file synthesis and protein folding were successful, demonstrating functional local
    processing.
  - The process generated DNA and protein files, indicated by successful local saves.
  - >-
    A 'Bad credentials' error with GitHub API signifies an issue with authentication, likely an
    expired or incorrect token.
  - >-
    Despite the authentication failure, the core metabolic cycle's local execution is deemed a
    significant success ('IT WORKED! ALMOST COMPLETELY!').
  - >-
    The system correctly identified the need for GitHub commit but failed due to credential issues,
    not process logic.
