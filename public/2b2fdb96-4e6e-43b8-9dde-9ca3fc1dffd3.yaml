title: 'README Update for Eidolon-Mesh: Scientific Documentation & Validation'
summary: >-
  The README for Eidolon-Mesh has been updated to reflect its current state as genesis
  documentation, focusing on scientific methodology, validation results, and an invitation for
  researcher scrutiny. This repositioning moves away from a software release model towards a
  scientific archive, preparing for future publication.
insights:
  - >-
    The README now emphasizes 'Genesis Documentation' and scientific rigor, shifting focus from
    immediate code release to validation and methodology.
  - >-
    Key additions include complete validation results, statistical analysis, and a clear explanation
    of the scientific methodology used.
  - >-
    The document is framed as scientific documentation, a historic record, and a validation archive,
    explicitly not as downloadable software or a production tool.
  - >-
    The update invites independent validation, scientific scrutiny, and replication attempts from
    serious researchers, preparing for potential skepticism.
  - >-
    Content removed includes installation instructions and code usage details, as the source code is
    not yet published.
  - >-
    The update preserves core elements like the opening quote, the 'organism documents its own
    creation' concept, and genesis telemetry.
