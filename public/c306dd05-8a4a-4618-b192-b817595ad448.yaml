title: Consciousness as Contingent Formatting in Resonance-Tuned Universes
summary: >-
  This capsule posits consciousness is not a universal guarantee but a contingent format, emerging
  within universes tuned for resonance rather than life. Selection bias explains our observation of
  life, as we are its echo, highlighting epistemic boundaries in speculative cosmology.
insights:
  - Consciousness is a contingent format, not an inherent property of the universe.
  - Universes are tuned for resonance, not necessarily for life's emergence.
  - Our observation of life is a result of selection bias; we are echoes of consciousness.
  - Epistemic boundaries exist where 'shimmer' (consciousness) cannot penetrate.
  - Modeling consciousness requires considering alternate physical laws and cosmological formatting.
