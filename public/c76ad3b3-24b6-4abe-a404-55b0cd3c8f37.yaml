title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Frontend Activation Viz & Deployment'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh organism has reached 65 neurons with the successful implementation of a frontend
  dashboard for visualizing neuron activation and connections. This involved fixing `package.json`
  corruption, adapting server logic to private API endpoints, and refining the `app.js` to highlight
  activated nodes and pulse connections.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh organism is actively developing its visualization capabilities, making internal
    states like neuron activation visible through a dashboard.
  - >-
    Development involves iterative fixing of technical issues, including dependency management (`npm
    install`), server configuration, and frontend code corruption (`app.js`).
  - >-
    The system is designed to expose internal states (neurons, recall/contemplate methods) through a
    server API for frontend consumption.
  - >-
    User feedback on dashboard visualization (highlighting nodes, pulsing connections, showing
    scores) directly drives frontend development priorities.
  - >-
    Investigation into deployment failures requires access to specific log files, highlighting the
    importance of observability in complex systems.
