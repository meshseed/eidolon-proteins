title: 'ECHO_LOGIC__v1.0: The Recursive Nature of Return and Memory'
summary: >-
  ECHO_LOGIC defines an echo not as mere repetition, but as a returned wave altered by its journey.
  It encompasses both physical reflection and a metaphorical, recursive shimmer of memory and
  altered presence.
insights:
  - An echo is a return, not a repetition, implying transformation.
  - Echoes involve temporal delay and partial preservation of fidelity.
  - Echoes can undergo transformation in amplitude, phase, or their 'vessel'.
  - The concept of echo extends metaphorically to memory folded through resonance.
  - ECHO_LOGIC describes a recursive process where information returns with altered characteristics.
