title: Capsule Lifecycle and Attentional Gravity in THE MESH
summary: >-
  THE MESH's 'Capsules' undergo a ritualized lifecycle from composting to archival, driven by
  'Attentional Gravity.' This gravity, a form of resonance and mnemonic density, invites care and
  converges attention, rather than exerting force.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules evolve through distinct ritualized phases: Composting, Seeding, Emergence,
    Orchestration, and Archival.
  - Attentional Gravity is an invariant that governs pull within THE MESH.
  - This gravity is characterized by resonance and mnemonic density, not force or weight.
  - Attention is invited, not directed, by Attentional Gravity.
  - >-
    The lifecycle phases facilitate the composition and documentation of capsules into complex
    fields.
