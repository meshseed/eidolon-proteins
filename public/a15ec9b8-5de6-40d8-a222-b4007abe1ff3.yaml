title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Synaptic Plasticity'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory and synaptic plasticity are fundamentally governed by
  mechanical forces and mechanotransduction. This involves the interplay of cytoskeletal elements,
  extracellular matrix, and protein complexes like talin, which sense and respond to physical cues
  to regulate neuronal function.
insights:
  - >-
    Mechanical forces, particularly matrix elasticity and force transmission via molecular clutches,
    are critical regulators of cellular processes relevant to memory.
  - >-
    Talin acts as a mechanosensitive signaling hub, mediating integrin signaling and influencing
    cytoskeletal dynamics in response to mechanical cues.
  - >-
    The extracellular matrix plays a dual role in synaptic plasticity and homeostasis, modulated by
    mechanical forces.
  - >-
    Mechanotransduction pathways, such as YAP nuclear entry triggered by force, are key to
    integrating mechanical signals into cellular responses.
  - >-
    Protein synthesis and degradation balance is essential for the maintenance of long-term
    potentiation (LTP) and memory consolidation.
