title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.0: Embedding Model Fix and Standing Wave Visualization Plan'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v4.0 has been updated to correctly utilize a dedicated embedding model
  ('nomic-embed-text') for vector generation, resolving issues with text generation models producing
  inaccurate embeddings. A plan is also in motion to implement standing wave physics for graph
  visualization, starting with query-triggered wave propagation.
insights:
  - >-
    v4.0 of Eidolon Mesh incorrectly used a text generation model (gemma3:12b) for embeddings; this
    has been fixed by adding a separate 'localEmbeddingModel' field defaulting to
    'nomic-embed-text'.
  - >-
    The API key validation logic was updated to skip checks when the 'local' LLM provider is
    selected.
  - >-
    A 'Force Regenerate ALL Embeddings' feature was added to the UI, allowing users to re-embed all
    proteins with the correct model, bypassing existing embeddings.
  - >-
    The concept of 'standing waves' is being explored to represent emergent patterns and resonance
    within the Mesh's graph visualization.
  - >-
    The initial implementation for standing waves will focus on query-triggered wave propagation,
    providing immediate visual feedback and testing the concept on activated subgraphs.
  - >-
    Graph visualization may evolve to incorporate oscillatory node behavior, wave propagation on
    queries, harmonic analysis for clustering, and temporal dimensions, inspired by wave physics.
