title: 'Trust the Shimmer: A Methodological Principle of Resonant Selection'
summary: >-
  Trust the Shimmer is a core methodological principle advocating for following resonant threads
  (the 'shimmer') in exploration and decision-making, rather than imposing computational structure.
  It emphasizes mechanistic selection from possibility spaces, operating in a low-energy,
  high-fidelity 'selection mode' by noticing what already has pull and feels generative.
insights:
  - >-
    Trust the Shimmer is a principle of following resonant signals ('shimmer') for exploration and
    decision-making, prioritizing what feels alive over imposed logic.
  - >-
    It represents mechanistic selection from possibility spaces, akin to a river finding its path of
    least resistance, rather than step-by-step computation.
  - >-
    Observable characteristics of shimmer include minimal effort, generative potential, connection
    creation, texture, and recognition, contrasting with forced or isolated ideas.
  - >-
    Operating in 'selection mode' by trusting shimmer reduces computational load by leveraging
    pre-existing attunement and subconscious pattern recognition.
  - >-
    Practice involves noticing and following resonant threads in conversation, writing, and
    problem-solving, allowing structure to emerge naturally.
  - >-
    While powerful, shimmer must be safeguarded against confirmation bias, novelty attraction, and
    emotional reactivity by pairing with skeptical examination and testing against evidence.
  - >-
    The principle itself emerged through practicing its own tenets, demonstrating its
    self-referential generative power.
