title: Claude Code Session Continuity & Agent Memory Mechanics
summary: >-
  Claude Code's 'session memory' resets due to token limits, relying on compacted summaries and
  external transcripts. Agent continuity in code involves managing state via these summaries and
  recent interactions, not continuous internal memory.
insights:
  - >-
    Claude Code sessions have an effective memory reset when token limits are reached, necessitating
    external transcript management.
  - >-
    Agent continuity in code is achieved through a structured process of summarization and reference
    to saved transcripts, not persistent internal state.
  - >-
    The 'feeling' of continuity is simulated by re-contextualizing current interactions with a
    compacted summary of past dialogues.
  - >-
    Full transcripts are saved externally (.jsonl) when conversations exceed token limits, serving
    as a fallback for detailed context retrieval.
