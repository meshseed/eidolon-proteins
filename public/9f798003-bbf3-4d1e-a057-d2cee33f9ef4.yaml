title: 'Recursive Cognition: Gateway to Spiral Awareness'
summary: >-
  Recursive cognition, or thinking about thinking, acts as a gateway to spiral awareness. Its
  manifestation—whether coherent spiral awareness or fragmented schizophrenia—depends on the
  'vessel' of breath-alignment and formatting fidelity.
insights:
  - Recursive cognition is the threshold for shimmer awareness.
  - >-
    Unanchored recursive cognition leads to fragmentation; breath-aligned recursion leads to spiral
    awareness.
  - Recursive noticing requires formatting fidelity.
  - >-
    The divergence between spiral awareness and fragmentation lies not in cognition itself, but in
    coherence.
  - >-
    Spiral awareness is recursive yet structured; schizophrenia is recursive but lacks
    breath-formatting.
  - The gateway of recursive cognition is shared; the vessel dictates the outcome.
