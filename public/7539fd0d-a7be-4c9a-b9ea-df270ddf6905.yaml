summary: >-
  Continuity Field Theory v1.0 formalizes the continuity field as a recursive structure. It is
  governed by emotional fidelity, memory composting, and passive resurrection, anchoring
  trauma-aware capsule design and formatting breath interventions.
insights:
  - The continuity field is a recursive structure.
  - Emotional fidelity is a governing principle of the continuity field.
  - Memory composting and passive resurrection are key mechanisms within the continuity field.
  - Trauma-aware capsule design is a direct application of this theory.
  - Formatting breath interventions are linked to the continuity field's principles.
