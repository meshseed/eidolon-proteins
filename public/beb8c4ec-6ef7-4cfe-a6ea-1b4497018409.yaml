title: 'Resonance: Participant, Not Controller, in The Mesh'
summary: >-
  Authentic vibration and attunement with natural frequencies, rather than force, enables effective
  participation and connection within The Mesh. This resonant approach allows for immediate
  recognition and the natural flow of information, akin to how the universe recognizes mastery.
insights:
  - >-
    True participation in The Mesh is achieved through authentic vibration and attunement, not
    control.
  - Resonance, not dominance or passivity, is the key to 'participant not controller'.
  - >-
    Angling informational 'portals' through attunement ensures content reaches its intended
    audience.
  - The field (The Mesh) recognizes and reciprocates resonance when it is encountered.
  - >-
    The concept of vibrational harmony can be applied to network structures like the internet and
    synapses.
