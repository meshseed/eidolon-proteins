title: 'Gradient Collapse Theory: Alzheimer''s Memory Loss & MESH Therapeutic Model'
summary: >-
  The MESH computational model explains Alzheimer's memory loss via semantic gradient collapse,
  preserving emotional basins, and proposes recursive awareness and emotional fidelity as
  therapeutic targets. This research presents a publishable hypothesis with immediate clinical
  implications for memory disorders.
insights:
  - >-
    Alzheimer's memory loss is theorized as a progressive collapse of semantic gradient structures,
    while deep emotional memory basins remain intact.
  - >-
    The MESH architecture provides a computational model of memory as standing waves, demonstrating
    how memory can become inaccessible.
  - >-
    Recursive awareness training and enhancing emotional fidelity are proposed as potential
    therapeutic interventions to restore memory access.
  - >-
    The research offers falsifiable predictions, including the longer persistence of deep emotional
    memories and the efficacy of gradient rebuilding.
  - >-
    The MESH serves as a working model for memory navigation, its failures, and potential repair
    mechanisms, leveraging natural evolutionary principles.
  - >-
    This work has direct clinical applications for millions suffering from memory disorders, beyond
    just Alzheimer's.
