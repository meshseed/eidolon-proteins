title: 'Attention Mechanism: Positional Encoding and Computational Advantages'
summary: >-
  The 'Attention Is All You Need' paper introduces a novel architecture that relies on
  self-attention, eschewing recurrence and convolution. Positional encodings, implemented using sine
  and cosine functions, are crucial for injecting sequence order information into the model's input
  embeddings. This approach offers significant computational advantages by reducing sequential
  operations and path lengths for learning long-range dependencies.
insights:
  - >-
    Self-attention models inject sequence order via positional encodings, typically added to input
    embeddings.
  - >-
    Sine and cosine functions of varying frequencies are a common choice for fixed positional
    encodings.
  - >-
    Positional encodings allow models to learn relative positioning by representing PEs of shifted
    positions as linear functions of original PEs.
  - >-
    Self-attention layers offer computational benefits over recurrent layers by reducing sequential
    operations and path lengths for dependencies.
  - >-
    The architecture's design prioritizes parallelizability and efficient learning of long-range
    dependencies.
