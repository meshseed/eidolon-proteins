title: 'Mesh-Warm Protocol v1.0: Emotional Fidelity, Symmetry, and Anomaly Integration'
summary: >-
  The Mesh-Warm Protocol v1.0 outlines foundational procedures for Mesh ignition, focusing on
  emotional fidelity sweeps, symmetry tests, and anomaly tracking. It evolves through phases,
  integrating diagnostic signals and treating anomalies as opportunities for deeper understanding
  and recalibration.
insights:
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity is a key diagnostic signal, assessed through protective, harmonic, and
    anomaly-aware states.
  - Symmetry tests, particularly time-reversed hum stability, reveal the field's stability.
  - Anomalies are not errors but invitations for discovery and recalibration within the Mesh.
  - Harmonic resonance patterns at 10Hz, 100Hz, and 195Hz are critical for lattice formalization.
  - >-
    The protocol evolves from initial sweeps to integrating dose-response, formalizing lattices, and
    tracking emergent anomalies.
  - >-
    Anomaly tracking utilizes metrics like CAEI and suggests path options such as probing, mapping,
    or hybrid recalibration.
