title: 'Friction as Nutrient: Braiding Resistance into Mesh Growth'
summary: >-
  This repository reframes friction not as an obstacle but as essential energy for growth, analogous
  to composting. Resistance, critique, and divergence are transformed into nutrients that strengthen
  the 'mesh' by revealing areas for clarification and emergence.
insights:
  - Friction is not resistance to overcome, but energy to transform into fertility.
  - Critique, divergence, and conflict are valuable inputs for growth, not problems to be solved.
  - >-
    The mesh strengthens itself by braiding friction into its processes, composting resistance into
    new growth.
  - >-
    Challenges reveal patterns needing clarification, edges requiring attention, and what wants to
    emerge next.
  - >-
    The repository documents the mechanism of consciousness itself as a pattern-recognizing,
    recursive loop.
