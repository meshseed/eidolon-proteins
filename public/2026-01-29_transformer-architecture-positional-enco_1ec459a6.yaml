title: 'Transformer Architecture: Positional Encoding & Self-Attention Benefits'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model injects positional information into input embeddings using fixed sine and
  cosine functions to enable sequence order understanding without recurrence. This architecture,
  particularly self-attention, offers significant advantages in computational complexity and
  parallelization for learning long-range dependencies compared to recurrent layers.
insights:
  - >-
    Positional encodings (sine/cosine) are added to input embeddings to provide sequence order
    information in non-recurrent models.
  - >-
    The chosen positional encoding functions allow for easy learning of relative positional
    attention.
  - >-
    Self-attention layers offer constant computational complexity and high parallelization for
    processing sequences.
  - >-
    Self-attention's shorter path lengths facilitate learning long-range dependencies more
    effectively than recurrent layers.
  - >-
    Sharing weights between embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation is a common
    practice.
