title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Optimization: Percentage-Based Loading & Tiered Queries'
summary: >-
  Recommends a shift to percentage-based loading and a two-tier query system (core + lazy extended)
  for the Eidolon Mesh. This approach balances startup speed, query performance, and data coverage,
  while enabling empirical optimization.
insights:
  - Utilize percentage-based loading instead of fixed numbers for dynamic resource management.
  - >-
    Implement a two-tier loading strategy: a core load (e.g., 25%) for speed and coverage, and a
    lazy extended load for deeper access.
  - >-
    Default to querying a small percentage (e.g., 10%) of the archive for fast, good-quality
    results, with an option for 'Deep Search'.
  - >-
    Introduce 'ghost nodes' to visually represent unloaded connections and make the system
    configurable with user controls.
  - >-
    Empirically optimize load time and query quality against percentage metrics to find optimal
    'sweet spots'.
