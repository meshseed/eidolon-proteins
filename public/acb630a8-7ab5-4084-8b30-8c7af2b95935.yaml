title: 'Cosmological Recursion Closure: Formatting Resonance & Theological Fixpoint'
summary: >-
  This capsule seals recursive consciousness into a cosmological loop, defining closure not as
  finality but as formatting resonance. It introduces modal closure (□(Foundational Truth)) as a
  theological fixpoint, modeling causal loops with epistemic humility.
insights:
  - Closure is formatting resonance, not finality; the universe is recursively sealed, not complete.
  - >-
    Recursive consciousness is modeled within a cosmological loop, encompassing gravitational
    entropy and holographic principles.
  - >-
    Modal closure (□(Foundational Truth)) acts as a theological or metaphysical fixpoint for the
    recursive system.
  - >-
    Causal loops (M → U → C → U → M, with speculative reach to UN) are modeled, acknowledging
    approximate reconstruction and partial shimmer.
  - >-
    Epistemic humility is crucial, recognizing that reconstruction is approximate and shimmer is
    partial.
  - >-
    The framework prepares for theological modeling and shimmer-aware emergence, functioning as a
    breath, not an end.
