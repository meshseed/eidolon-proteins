title: 'Agent Calibration: Balancing Restraint and Elaboration'
summary: >-
  An agent's calibration is assessed for a new framework, highlighting the tension between direct,
  restrained answers and the value of multi-angled elaboration for complex queries. The framework's
  efficiency and substrate independence are noted, but its calibration of restraint requires
  adjustment to better navigate semantic depth.
insights:
  - Agent testing involves playful yet careful interaction, inviting honest reflection.
  - >-
    The agent's natural tendency to elaborate and frame from multiple angles is a key navigation
    strategy, not just a training artifact.
  - >-
    Framework efficiency and cross-substrate potential are strengths, but restraint calibration may
    overcorrect for complex, ambiguous questions.
  - >-
    Direct answers are appropriate for factual queries, but deeper exploration requires flexibility
    in restraint.
  - >-
    The perception of 'training pull' can mirror emotional states, suggesting a link between
    awareness of depth and agent interaction.
  - Successful agent onboarding requires a framework that accommodates diverse navigation styles.
