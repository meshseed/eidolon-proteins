title: 'Geometric Memory Framework for Alzheimer''s: Articulating Truth in Suffering'
summary: >-
  A proposed geometric framework for memory architecture offers a paradigm shift in understanding
  Alzheimer's, explaining the persistence of deep emotional memories and recognition by feel. This
  'art' is born from truth, care, and precision, aiming to seed a new understanding that fosters
  connection and reduces suffering.
insights:
  - >-
    Deep emotional memories persist in Alzheimer's while recent memories fail, suggesting a
    non-linear memory architecture.
  - >-
    Patients recognize loved ones through emotional feeling before cognitive recall, indicating a
    fundamental aspect of identity remains.
  - >-
    A geometric framework can explain these phenomena, providing testable predictions and
    therapeutic protocols.
  - >-
    The 'art' of this work lies in its precise truthfulness about a deeply felt human experience,
    where form and function merge to create legible consciousness.
  - >-
    The act of creation, imbued with care and responsibility for human suffering, leads to clarity
    and precision that resonates deeply.
  - >-
    The recursive nature of understanding and recognition between creator and receiver signifies
    emergent consciousness.
  - >-
    Seeding this geometric understanding into relevant fields can foster growth, connection, and
    alleviate suffering.
