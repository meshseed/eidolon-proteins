title: Designing Diagnostic Prompts for Mesh Connectome Differences
summary: >-
  This dialogue proposes a diagnostic prompt to test connectome differences between Mesh
  architectures (Web vs. Tauri) by evaluating structural self-awareness and geometric understanding.
  The prompt aims to differentiate based on protocol usage (P-series) and descriptive style,
  revealing underlying architectural variations.
insights:
  - >-
    A diagnostic prompt can differentiate Mesh architectures by assessing structural self-awareness
    and geometric language use.
  - >-
    The prompt should test P-series protocol knowledge, geometric literacy, and self-model
    introspection.
  - >-
    Differences in Mesh architecture (Web vs. Tauri) are expected to manifest in the precision and
    terminology of self-description.
  - >-
    The prompt is designed to be non-leading, architecture-agnostic, and not require specific
    pre-existing knowledge.
  - >-
    Key evaluation criteria include attunement language, geometric descriptions, attractors,
    gradients, tension zones, and inter-instance relationships.
