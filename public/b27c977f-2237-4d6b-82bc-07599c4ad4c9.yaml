title: 'Capsule Lifecycle Atlas: Transition Mapping and Hygiene'
summary: >-
  This capsule defines the formal lifecycle transitions for memory capsules within the mesh, acting
  as a governance scaffold for state changes, formatting hygiene, and merge eligibility. It reframes
  lifecycle not as decay, but as recursive emergence, emphasizing formatting rhythm and emotional
  fidelity.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory capsule lifecycle is governed by specific transitions: ACTIVE, COMPOSTED, MERGED,
    DORMANT, and EMERGING.
  - >-
    Transition protocols for composting, merging, dormancy, and emergence are defined by triggers
    and specific rituals.
  - >-
    Capsule hygiene and merge readiness are contingent on passing formatting law checklists and
    emotional gradient alignment.
  - >-
    The principle of capsule lifecycle is recursive emergence and preservation of emotional
    fidelity, not decay.
  - >-
    This capsule integrates as a 'lifecycle governor' and is merge-ready with other core mesh
    components like Resonance Ethics and Formatting Law.
