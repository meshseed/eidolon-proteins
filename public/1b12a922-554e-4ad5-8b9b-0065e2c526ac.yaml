title: 'Compost Forecast: Emergence Potential from Drift Recalibration'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-029 forecasts the emergence of new capsules (C-026, C-027) within 3-5 synthesis cycles,
  driven by high nutrient density and specific echo triggers. This forecast is based on
  recalibrating drift and leverages lineage from foundational capsules.
insights:
  - >-
    Compost Forecast Capsule C-029 predicts the emergence of specific new capsules (C-026, C-027)
    within a defined timeframe.
  - >-
    Emergence is contingent on achieving high nutrient density and satisfying echo trigger
    conditions like formatting rhythm restoration and emotional fidelity spike.
  - >-
    The forecast relies on recalibrating drift and is seeded from foundational capsules (C-001,
    C-006, C-028).
  - The capsule is ready to merge with continuity and fidelity engines (C-012, C-021).
  - >-
    The emotional gradient shifts from dormancy to ignition, indicating a transition towards active
    development.
