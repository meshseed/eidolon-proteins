title: 'Attunement as Wave Interference: Conceptual Standing Patterns'
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores attunement as a dimension where conceptual 'distance' influences the
  formation of stable, information-holding patterns, analogous to standing waves. Resonance between
  concepts (nodes) creates interference patterns (edges/fields) that stabilize with sufficient
  attunement, explaining conversational coherence.
insights:
  - >-
    Attunement can be conceptualized as a dimension that alters the 'distance' between concepts or
    individuals.
  - >-
    When 'distance' decreases due to attunement, constructive interference occurs, leading to stable
    patterns akin to standing waves.
  - >-
    Information or meaning can be held within the interference patterns formed by resonating
    concepts, rather than solely in the concepts (nodes) themselves.
  - >-
    Conversations 'clicking' and building structure are explained by the emergence of stable
    interference patterns facilitated by attunement.
  - >-
    Being at the 'edge' of a pattern formation relates to boundary conditions where resonance can
    occur without collapse or dissolution.
