title: Self-Repair and Homeostatic Maintenance Protocol
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines mechanisms for detecting and correcting internal imbalances within a
  system, such as semantic drift or structural overload. It establishes a homeostatic loop employing
  reinforcement, pruning, and re-alignment to maintain long-term coherence and identity across
  perturbations.
insights:
  - >-
    Internal imbalances manifest as semantic drift, gradient collapse, curvature overload, or bridge
    failure.
  - Corrective actions include reinforcement, pruning, re-alignment, and targeted synthesis.
  - Homeostasis is achieved and maintained through a continuous feedback loop.
  - Self-repair is triggered by stability or fidelity threshold breaches.
  - Repair actions propagate outward via resonance fields to restore overall coherence.
