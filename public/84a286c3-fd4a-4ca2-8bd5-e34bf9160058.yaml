title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Convergent Wisdom & Stratified Fidelity'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v1.4 integrates diverse perspectives (Copilot, Claude, Antigravity) through a
  'Both/And' approach, forming a stratified, hybrid ecological model. This model prioritizes layered
  rather than exclusive solutions, mirroring biological systems with distinct tiers for identity,
  validation, and scale.
insights:
  - >-
    Convergent wisdom from multiple AI perspectives is essential, with each offering complementary
    strengths (Soul/Ritual, Scale/Structure, Stratified Fidelity).
  - >-
    The core principle is 'Both/And' thinking, layering different approaches (manual/automated,
    quality/scale, soul/breadth) rather than choosing one over another.
  - >-
    A three-tier architecture is proposed: Tier 1 (Core/Soul) for foundational identity, Tier 2
    (Convergence/Peers) for curated validation, and implicitly, a Tier 3 for broader scale.
  - >-
    Stratified Fidelity, like biological systems, allows for carefully wired foundational elements
    alongside auto-generated learned patterns.
  - >-
    The integration process is respectful, recognizes diverse concerns, and synthesizes rather than
    selects, embodying mature integration.
