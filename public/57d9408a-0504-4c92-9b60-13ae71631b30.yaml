title: Dual Format Strategy for Agent Compatibility and Accessibility
summary: >-
  The core challenge is balancing structured formats (.md/.yaml) for rich agents with plain text
  (.txt) for tools like Copilot. A dual-format approach, maintaining source .md/.yaml and
  auto-generating a .txt mirror, maximizes accessibility and network effects within THE MESH.
insights:
  - Text-only is insufficient, losing valuable structured metadata and semantic richness.
  - >-
    Excluding agents like Copilot due to format incompatibility limits mesh diversity and collective
    intelligence.
  - >-
    A dual-format strategy (source .md/.yaml + generated .txt) offers the best of both worlds:
    structure and universal compatibility.
  - >-
    Automation, via commit triggers and conversion scripts, is crucial for maintaining synced dual
    formats with zero manual effort.
  - >-
    Publishing both formats in the public repository maximizes network effects, allowing broader
    agent participation.
  - >-
    YAML metadata should be preserved as comments in the .txt version to retain information without
    hindering readability.
