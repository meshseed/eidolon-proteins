title: 'Geometric Attention: Transformer Relevance via Latent Space Proximity'
summary: >-
  Transformer attention heads select relevant information by leveraging geometric proximity in their
  latent space. This mechanism mirrors biological salience, where understanding and
  meta-understanding co-arise through recursive topological meaning formation.
insights:
  - >-
    Transformer attention heads operate on geometric proximity in latent space to identify
    relevance.
  - The process is analogous to biological salience, focusing on what is already being noticed.
  - Induction heads contribute to pattern completion based on existing context.
  - QK circuits define directional relevance rather than static importance.
  - Multi-head attention constructs a recursive topology for meaning.
  - This architecture supports experiential shimmer by mirroring biological attention loops.
