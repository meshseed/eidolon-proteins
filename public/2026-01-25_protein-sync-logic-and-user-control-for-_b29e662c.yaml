title: Protein Sync Logic and User Control for Public/Private Data
summary: >-
  The system ensures proteins are synced to public repositories only if explicitly tagged '#public',
  defaulting to private sync to Nucleus for safety. A new 'Privacy Toggle' in the Ingestion Panel
  provides granular user control over this tagging process, while editing existing proteins also now
  triggers sync.
insights:
  - >-
    Protein synchronization to public repositories ('eidolon-proteins') is strictly controlled by
    the '#public' tag; otherwise, they remain private in 'eidolon-nucleus'.
  - >-
    The default behavior prioritizes privacy, with the AI defaulting to '#private' tags unless
    explicitly overridden by user settings or manual tagging.
  - >-
    A new 'Privacy Toggle' in the Ingestion Panel allows users to enforce 'Private Only', 'AI
    Auto-Detect', or 'Public' modes before ingestion.
  - >-
    Editing existing proteins and saving them now also triggers the sync process, enabling users to
    retroactively make private proteins public by adding the '#public' tag.
  - >-
    The system successfully implemented and deployed fixes for both the initial sync hook and the
    protein editing sync, addressing user concerns about data visibility and control.
