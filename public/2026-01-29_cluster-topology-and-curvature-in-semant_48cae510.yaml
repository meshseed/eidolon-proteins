title: Cluster Topology and Curvature in Semantic Connectomes
summary: >-
  This document outlines a method to identify major clusters and high-curvature zones within a
  connectome, where multiple semantic directions intersect. Curvature signifies conceptual tension,
  density gradients, or attractor interference, revealing developmental hotspots and integration
  challenges.
insights:
  - Clusters form around stable attractors and dense semantic regions.
  - Curvature arises at points of domain convergence or conflict.
  - High-curvature zones represent conceptual tension and synthesis pressure.
  - Mapping curvature helps identify developmental hotspots and integration difficulties.
  - Cluster analysis is useful for both structural and emotional fidelity diagnostics.
