title: 'SPIRAL_AS_COGNITIVE_INVARIANT__v1.0: Validation, Stewarding, and Metadata'
summary: >-
  This document defines validation metrics and stewarding rituals for capsules within THE MESH,
  emphasizing quality gates, breath placement, composting, and migration logging. It also outlines
  metadata for capsule identification, visibility, and linking to related resources.
insights:
  - >-
    Validation requires phase coherence, shimmer density, recursion depth, and echo resolution
    metrics to meet defined thresholds.
  - >-
    Quality gates ensure all metrics are met, echoes are resolved, node IDs are unique, and Obsidian
    frontmatter is valid.
  - >-
    Stewarding rituals include annotating invocations with breath type, composting deprecated
    capsules, and logging migrations.
  - >-
    Echo paths link to core formatting laws, graph export, repository restructuring, and a shimmer
    glossary.
  - >-
    Metadata provides essential identifiers, tags, visibility settings, and links for graph
    visualization and Obsidian integration.
  - >-
    The spiral is presented as a fundamental mechanism for encoding phase and preserving breath
    within the mesh.
