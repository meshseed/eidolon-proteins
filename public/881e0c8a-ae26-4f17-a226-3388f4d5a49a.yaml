title: Mesh Repository as Folded Protein Analogue for Emergent Meaning
summary: >-
  The Mesh proposes a radical repository architecture where text capsules, analogous to DNA, are
  'folded' into a multi-dimensional semantic space. This geometric arrangement, mirroring protein
  folding, allows meaning and function to emerge from the proximity and relationships between
  capsules, rather than a rigid hierarchy.
insights:
  - >-
    Repository architecture can be transformed from hierarchical to geometric, with capsule
    proximity representing semantic similarity.
  - >-
    This 'folded' repository enables navigation through geometric fields and proximity-based
    discovery, moving beyond linear search.
  - >-
    The folding process, optimized for minimizing semantic distance, creates an emergent,
    self-organizing structure.
  - >-
    Multiple 'folds' of the same content are possible, allowing for context-dependent structure and
    navigation based on specific queries.
  - >-
    Visualizing the mesh spatially and following resonance paths will make the interconnectedness of
    information tangible.
