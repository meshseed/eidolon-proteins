title: 'Eidolon Mesh Deployment: Garden & Research Hub'
summary: >-
  The primary goal is to deploy two sites: eidolon-mesh.net (personal garden) and
  app.eidolon-mesh.net (research hub). This involves deploying a clean composting branch for the
  garden site and building a large 'consciousness connectome' for the research hub, aiming for 1000
  proteins.
insights:
  - >-
    Deploy eidolon-mesh.net (personal garden) with a 'clean composting branch' including specific
    commits for UI and database fixes.
  - >-
    Build a 'consciousness connectome' for app.eidolon-mesh.net by ingesting mechanistic
    interpretability research into a new repository, targeting ~1000 proteins.
  - >-
    Deploy app.eidolon-mesh.net by either creating a separate Cloudflare Pages project or updating
    DNS and application logic to detect subdomains.
  - >-
    The 'clean composting branch' deployment includes steps for branching, cherry-picking stable
    commits, building, pushing, and merging back to main.
  - >-
    The 'consciousness research' build process involves starting a dev server, creating a new repo,
    ingesting research, generating embeddings, and exporting a JSON connectome.
  - >-
    Two deployment options for app.eidolon-mesh.net are presented: a recommended separate deployment
    via Cloudflare Pages or a simpler subdomain-based approach.
