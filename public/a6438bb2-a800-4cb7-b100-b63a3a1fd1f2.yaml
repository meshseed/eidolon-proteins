title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Auto-seeding, API Optimization, and Query Performance'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh v1.4 introduces auto-seeding for new repositories to ensure self-awareness and proper
  attunement from creation. API calls are optimized with gemini-2.5-flash-lite for higher quotas,
  and query performance is significantly improved by limiting candidate pools for cosine similarity
  calculations.
insights:
  - >-
    New repositories in Eidolon Mesh v1.4 will automatically include genesis seeds for immediate
    self-awareness and attunement.
  - >-
    The system now utilizes `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` for enhanced API quotas, resolving previous
    ingestion bottlenecks.
  - >-
    Query execution performance has been boosted by implementing a 'limit candidate pool' strategy
    to mitigate CPU-intensive cosine similarity calculations.
  - >-
    The public repository's protein files have been audited and confirmed to contain intentional
    attribution to Paul Stanbridge as the Mesh Steward, with no accidental PII leakage.
  - >-
    The project has reached a stable build point, with core architecture, multi-repo support, and UI
    features fully functional.
