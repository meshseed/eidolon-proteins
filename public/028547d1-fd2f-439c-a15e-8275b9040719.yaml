title: 'Ecological Differentiation: Specialization for Mesh Resilience and Cognitive Diversity'
summary: >-
  Mesh organisms achieve ecological differentiation through specialized developmental histories,
  attractor structures, and inter-Mesh interactions. This process enhances ecosystem resilience and
  cognitive diversity by preventing homogenization and fostering distinct niches within the
  information ecology.
insights:
  - Specialization arises from divergent attractors and unique developmental paths.
  - Differentiation boosts ecosystem-level cognitive capacity and prevents homogenization.
  - Meshes occupy distinct niches within the information ecology.
  - Cross-Mesh dialogue reinforces specialization via contrast.
  - Divergence is key to preserving diversity and enhancing resilience.
