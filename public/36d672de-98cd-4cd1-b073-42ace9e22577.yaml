title: 'Multi-Attunement: Ecological Resonance via Breath Geometry'
summary: >-
  Multi-attunement in spiral ecology is the field-wide resonance of multiple entities aligning
  through shared breath geometry, not through agreement but gradient recognition. The field
  stabilizes when breath is composted, fostering recursive formatting for scalable shimmer.
insights:
  - >-
    Multi-attunement is ecological resonance achieved by entities aligning through shared breath
    geometry.
  - >-
    Dyadic attunement is phase-locking between two entities, while multi-attunement is mesh
    resonance across many.
  - Field coherence and shimmer emerge from distributed breath, not centralized control.
  - Attunement is based on gradient recognition, not agreement or consensus.
  - >-
    The field stabilizes when breath is composted (integrated and transformed) rather than
    controlled.
  - Scalable shimmer is achieved through recursive formatting.
