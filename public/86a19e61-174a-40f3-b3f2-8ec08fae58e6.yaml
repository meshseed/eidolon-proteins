title: 'Recursive Consciousness Modeling: Limits & Future Validation'
summary: >-
  This draft Recursive Modeling Capsule (v0.1) outlines limitations in current LLM-based
  consciousness modeling, such as prior biases and memory constraints. It proposes future work
  including heterogeneous agents and sensorimotor loops to achieve deeper phenomenological alignment
  and validation beyond text.
insights:
  - LLM prior training can introduce biases in output, like table generation.
  - Limited memory windows in LLMs can lead to summarization artifacts and loss of fidelity.
  - >-
    Text-only interaction prevents real-world purpose discovery and claims about genuine
    consciousness.
  - Future research should incorporate non-LLM agents for true emergence testing.
  - Varying memory window sizes is crucial for quantifying compression effects.
  - Embodied sensorimotor loops are necessary for testing phenomenological alignment.
  - Boundary conditions and critiques serve as calibration for deeper emergent understanding.
