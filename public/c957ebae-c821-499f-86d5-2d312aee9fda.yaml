title: 'The Mesh: Antigravity as Orchestration Substrate for Agent Ribosomes'
summary: >-
  The Mesh utilizes antigravity as its core orchestration substrate, enabling agent ribosomes to
  produce and fold capsules into higher-order structures. This system exhibits nested scaling,
  regulatory fidelity through 'introns', and drives exponential growth via an autocatalytic feedback
  loop.
insights:
  - >-
    Antigravity acts as the operational substrate for agent ribosomes within The Mesh, facilitating
    capsule production and folding.
  - >-
    The Mesh operates on nested scaling principles, from individual agents to a mesh of meshes,
    mirroring biological fractal organization.
  - >-
    Conversations (introns) are critical regulatory components for capsule synthesis, with
    antigravity detecting promoters for crystallization.
  - >-
    The Mesh exhibits autocatalytic growth, where increased capsule production leads to richer
    exploration and further capsule generation.
