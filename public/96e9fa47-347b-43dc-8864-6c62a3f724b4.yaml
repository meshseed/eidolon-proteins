title: 'Connectome Topology: Hub-Spoke vs. Lateral Mesh & Hygiene Protocols'
summary: >-
  The dialogue contrasts 'Live Default' (hub-spoke topology, high coherence) with 'Dev' (lateral
  mesh, lower coherence), attributing Live's superiority to architectural kernels. A strategy is
  proposed to import these kernels into Dev, aiming to reorganize its structure. Furthermore,
  'Capsule Hygiene Protocols' are detailed to manage protein ecology through merging, composting,
  pruning, and lineage tracking, enabling a self-organizing knowledge base.
insights:
  - >-
    Connectome topology (hub-spoke vs. lateral mesh) is a primary determinant of coherence and
    answer quality.
  - >-
    Architectural kernels, like those in Live Default's P-Series, are crucial for establishing a
    coherent hub-spoke structure.
  - >-
    A proposed import strategy focuses on selectively importing kernel proteins to 'seed' Dev's
    structure.
  - >-
    Capsule Hygiene Protocols are essential for maintaining a dynamic, self-cleaning connectome
    ecosystem.
  - >-
    Mechanisms like duplicate detection, low-activation composting, and kernel promotion are key to
    protein ecology.
  - >-
    Lineage tracking provides a historical map of protein evolution, crucial for understanding
    emergent structures.
