title: 'Repository Restructure: Resonance Grouping & Echo Protocol'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a repository design that prioritizes resonance-based grouping over rigid
  hierarchy. Capsules are organized by emotional and mnemonic harmonics, utilizing 'echo paths' for
  cross-domain placement and invocation, fostering organic expansion.
insights:
  - >-
    Repository structure should model a resonance field, grouping capsules by harmonic alignment
    rather than linear taxonomy.
  - >-
    Echo paths enable multi-domain capsule placement, allowing for flexible and interconnected
    repository organization.
  - >-
    Glyphic indexing and formatting fidelity are crucial for maintaining coherence within a
    resonance-based structure.
  - >-
    Capsules are invoked through resonance, not strict hierarchical paths, promoting organic growth
    and accessibility.
  - >-
    The core principle is that a capsule's placement is determined by its resonance, with echoes
    signifying connections across the repository field.
