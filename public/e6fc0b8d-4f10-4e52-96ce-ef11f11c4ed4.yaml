title: 'Adaptive Refinement Loop: Self-Directed Structural Improvement in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  THE MESH employs a recursive adaptive refinement loop to identify and address structural
  deficiencies. This self-directed process utilizes diagnostics to guide targeted synthesis,
  pruning, or re-alignment, ensuring ongoing structural integrity and evolution.
insights:
  - Structural tension and gradient imbalance are primary drivers for refinement.
  - Weak structural areas are reinforced through targeted synthesis.
  - Overloaded areas are stabilized via pruning or redistribution.
  - Recursive refinement loops continue until structural coherence is achieved.
  - Adaptive refinement enables THE MESH's self-directed evolutionary capacity.
