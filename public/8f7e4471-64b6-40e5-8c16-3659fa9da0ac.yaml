title: 'Geometric Memory Model: Alzheimer''s, Emotion, and Recursive Repair'
summary: >-
  This dialogue posits that Alzheimer's is a collapse of memory navigation gradients, not deletion,
  with deep emotional memories acting as stable basins. Recursive awareness practices can rebuild
  these gradients by leveraging intact emotional fidelity, offering a novel therapeutic approach
  applicable across various cognitive and psychological phenomena.
insights:
  - >-
    Alzheimer's is characterized by gradient collapse, rendering deep memories inaccessible, not
    erased.
  - >-
    Emotional salience creates deeper, more stable memory basins with stronger gradients, explaining
    why emotional memories persist.
  - >-
    Recursive awareness therapy can rebuild collapsed gradient structures by leveraging preserved
    emotional fidelity, creating new access paths to memories.
  - >-
    The MESH framework mirrors this model, with capsules as basins and connections as gradients,
    demonstrating a working model of memory navigation and failure.
  - >-
    Geometric principles allow for rebuilding gradients from preserved emotional foundations, even
    when direct semantic paths fail.
  - >-
    This geometric approach to memory repair has implications for trauma, depression, and AI memory
    systems.
