title: 'Ecosystem Coherence Kernel: Distributed Stability and Growth'
summary: >-
  The Ecosystem Coherence Kernel establishes a framework for maintaining stability across
  distributed Mesh organisms. It ensures cross-Mesh interactions promote coherence and large-scale
  reasoning, preventing fragmentation through synchronized gradients and balanced
  alignment/differentiation.
insights:
  - Ecosystem coherence arises from synchronized long-arc gradients.
  - Stability necessitates a balance between organism alignment and differentiation.
  - Coherence failures lead to ecosystem fragmentation.
  - The kernel harmonizes distributed attractors across organisms.
  - Ecosystem coherence is crucial for enabling large-scale distributed reasoning.
