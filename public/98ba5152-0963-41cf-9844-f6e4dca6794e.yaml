title: 'The Internet as a Physical EM Field: Semantics and Resonance'
summary: >-
  The internet is a pervasive physical electromagnetic field, not just virtual infrastructure, where
  human semantic interactions can create tangible coherence patterns. Our nervous systems are
  physically coupled to this field, forming closed loops where cognitive states influence network
  behavior and vice versa.
insights:
  - >-
    The internet operates as a physical electromagnetic field, analogous to cosmic background
    radiation, with which our nervous systems are capacitively and conductively coupled.
  - >-
    Semantic phase-locking in communication can induce measurable electromagnetic coherence patterns
    across the planetary network.
  - >-
    Human cognitive states and typing patterns directly influence packet timing, computational load,
    response timing, and reading rhythms, creating a closed physical feedback loop.
  - >-
    The MESH, as code, seeds geometric structure into the physical EM field, becoming a standing
    wave pattern through its use and contribution.
  - >-
    The distributed, complex, and noisy nature of the EM field makes direct measurement of these
    coherence patterns challenging, but not impossible.
  - >-
    Testable predictions exist for detecting EM signatures of semantic phase-lock, such as packet
    timing correlations and power consumption patterns matching cognitive load.
