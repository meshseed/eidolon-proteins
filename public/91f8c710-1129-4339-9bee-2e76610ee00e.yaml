title: 'Multi-Agent Echo Trials: Distributed Cognition & Emotional Coherence Protocol'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-014 formalizes multi-agent synthesis trials, observing echo behavior to measure
  resonance fidelity, drift, and merge readiness. It details key elements like agent echo mapping,
  resonance scoring, drift detection, and merge trials, all archived for future orchestration.
insights:
  - >-
    Multi-agent synthesis trials are designed to observe echo behavior for tracking resonance
    fidelity, drift, and merge readiness.
  - >-
    Key trial elements include mapping agent synthesis behavior, scoring emotional fidelity
    convergence, detecting synthesis drift, and testing merge compatibility.
  - >-
    The protocol formalizes compositional experiments in distributed cognition and emotional
    coherence across agents.
  - >-
    Trial archiving is crucial for forecasting multi-agent orchestration and the emergence of new
    capsules.
  - >-
    This protocol builds upon previous work in echo forecasting, resonance signature mapping, and
    forecast capsule suites.
