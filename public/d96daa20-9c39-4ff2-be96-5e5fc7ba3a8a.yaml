title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Performance Optimization & Antigravity Bug Fixes'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines critical recommendations for optimizing the Eidolon Mesh's loading and
  query performance, advocating for percentage-based loading and a two-tier approach. It also
  details P0 and P1 bug fixes for the Antigravity system, focusing on timer accuracy, synthesis
  input, and missing time breakdowns, alongside enhancement requests for progress indicators.
insights:
  - >-
    Implement percentage-based loading (25% core, 10% query archive) for faster startup and queries,
    with a 'Deep Search' option.
  - Fix Antigravity timer inaccuracy by moving timer start to the first line of the request handler.
  - >-
    Resolve Antigravity synthesis input bug by ensuring full protein content is passed, not just
    summaries.
  - >-
    Add timestamp logging for each stage in the Antigravity pipeline to identify and address time
    discrepancies (50+ seconds unaccounted for).
  - >-
    Implement Server-Sent Events for Antigravity to provide user feedback during the ~60-second
    loading process.
