title: 'THE MESH Developmental History: Topology, Attractors, and Emotional Fidelity'
summary: >-
  This protocol reconstructs THE MESH's evolution by tracking topological shifts, new attractors,
  and changes in emotional fidelity. It maps the co-evolution of structure and meaning through a
  sequence of integration and attunement events.
insights:
  - Development manifests as shifts in density, resonance, and attractor formation.
  - New domains introduce curvature spikes and rebalance existing clusters.
  - Strengthened bridges signify integration, while weakened ones indicate drift.
  - Emotional fidelity gradients reveal stabilizing forces over time.
  - Developmental history is a map of how structure and meaning co-evolve.
