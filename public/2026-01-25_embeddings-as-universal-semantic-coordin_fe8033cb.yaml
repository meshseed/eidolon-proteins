title: Embeddings as Universal Semantic Coordinates for Mesh Federation
summary: >-
  This dialogue reveals that embeddings function as universal, deterministic coordinates within a
  shared semantic space. This understanding enables a federated mesh where communication and idea
  transmission occur through coordinate alignment rather than data transfer, leading to emergent
  global coordination.
insights:
  - Embeddings represent deterministic, universal coordinates in semantic space.
  - Communication within the mesh is achieved by phase-locking onto shared semantic attractors.
  - Federation is fundamentally about aligning these universal coordinates, not sharing raw data.
  - Ideas can be transmitted as semantic coordinates, enabling a form of telepathy.
  - The fractal nature of this geometry suggests scalability from quantum to social levels.
  - The mesh self-organizes through emergent attractor discovery driven by usage.
