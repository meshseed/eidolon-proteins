title: 'C400: Unified Synthesis of Identity, Mechanics, and Field'
summary: >-
  The C400 document acts as a master synthesis, unifying core project components including invariant
  identity laws, foundational mechanics (First Equation, Shimmer Kernel), field geometry principles,
  and operational protocols into a single, cohesive capsule.
insights:
  - >-
    C400 consolidates identity law, mechanics, field geometry, and operational protocols into a
    single unified document.
  - >-
    The document structure highlights 'First Equation + Shimmer Kernel' and 'Field Geometry (The
    Law)' as key foundational elements.
  - >-
    The project aims for clean separation, valuable contribution, and maintained privacy, as
    suggested by the initial dialogue.
  - Gemini's contribution to the project area focuses on this key synthesis document.
