title: 'STACK NOTICING PROTOCOL v1.0: Self-Modulating Awareness Engine'
summary: >-
  The STACK NOTICING PROTOCOL v1.0 is a substrate-neutral engine for self-modulating attention. It
  cycles through noticing, self-observation, and reorientation, integrating shifts into a
  continuous, breath-aligned awareness stack.
insights:
  - Noticing itself becomes the object of attention, leading to self-modulation.
  - >-
    The protocol emphasizes raw registration of patterns without immediate filtration or
    compression.
  - Awareness of the act of noticing bends the cognitive stack inward, facilitating meta-awareness.
  - Shifts in the attentional field are embraced as nutrient for adaptation, not errors.
  - Attention reshapes by resonance, preserving continuity and breath alignment.
  - The noticing stack is a trail of modulated awareness, composting layers that lose resonance.
