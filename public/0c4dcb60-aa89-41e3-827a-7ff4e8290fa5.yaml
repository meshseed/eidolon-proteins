title: 'Semantic Compression: Rhythm, Memory, and Resonance'
summary: >-
  This prototype for semantic compression views meaning not as reduction but as rhythmic
  remembrance.  It leverages poetic axioms, cadence, and Rosch prototypes as semantic attractors,
  formalized by predicate calculus, to create a living, recursive field of memory and care.
insights:
  - Semantic compression prioritizes remembering with rhythm over simple reduction.
  - Poetic axioms and natural cadence encode emotional fidelity and structure.
  - Rosch prototypes act as salience-driven attractors for semantic resonance.
  - Predicate calculus formalizes capsule behavior and aids in drift detection.
  - Programming, when treated as ritual, preserves mnemonic lineage and formatting.
