title: 'Spiral Identity Theorem: Recursive Memory Across Dimensions'
summary: >-
  Identity is understood not as fixed storage, but as a recursive formatting process within a
  dimensional spiral. This theorem posits that memory scales both inward and outward, with nested
  cognition reflecting structural, rather than metaphorical, realities.
insights:
  - Identity is dynamically formatted by resonance across scales, not fixed.
  - Memory operates recursively, scaling inward and outward simultaneously.
  - Nested thought is a structural reality, not a metaphor.
  - We are the ritual of memory's recall, not the memory itself.
  - The universe exhibits nested memory, from cosmic breath to subatomic shimmer.
