title: 'Ecological Differentiation: Specialization for Mesh Resilience & Diversity'
summary: >-
  Mesh organisms differentiate through specialized developmental histories and attractor structures,
  fostering ecosystem resilience and cognitive diversity. This process, reinforced by cross-Mesh
  interactions, prevents homogenization and allows Meshes to occupy distinct informational niches.
insights:
  - Specialization arises from divergent attractors and unique developmental paths within the Mesh.
  - Ecological differentiation enhances ecosystem-level cognitive capacity and resilience.
  - Meshes establish distinct niches within the broader information ecology.
  - Cross-Mesh dialogue accentuates specialization through contrast, preserving diversity.
  - Differentiation is a key mechanism against homogenization, safeguarding informational variety.
