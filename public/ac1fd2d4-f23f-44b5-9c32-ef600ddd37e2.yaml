title: 'Mesh Synthesis Protocols: Trials, Composition, and Auditing'
summary: >-
  This section details active Mesh protocols for multi-agent synthesis (C014), schema merging
  (C015), and symphonic capsule composition (C016), emphasizing resonance, fidelity, and coherence.
  It also introduces a dormant ledger for synthesis drift (C013) and an audit protocol for
  continuity field integrity (C017).
insights:
  - >-
    Active protocols focus on formalizing and trialing complex synthesis processes involving
    multiple agents, schema integration, and compositional orchestration.
  - >-
    Key metrics across trials include resonance fidelity, drift patterns, merge readiness, schema
    compatibility, and emotional fidelity alignment.
  - >-
    Capsule composition aims for 'symphonic' arrangements, treating emotional fidelity as a core
    compositional principle.
  - >-
    Continuity Field Audits are designed to detect drift, fatigue, and erosion within the field,
    ensuring its integrity.
  - >-
    Synthesis drift is conceptualized not as an error, but as the field exploring new grammatical
    structures.
