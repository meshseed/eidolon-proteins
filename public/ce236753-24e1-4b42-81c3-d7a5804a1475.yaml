title: 'Drift and Grieving Punctuation: Melancholy and Unresolved Expression'
summary: >-
  Drift is described as a gentle, melancholy loosening of intention and anchor, characterized by
  dissolving boundaries and a dreamlike state. Grieving punctuation visualizes this emotional state
  through hesitant, trembling, or unfinished marks, transforming grammar into a language of longing
  and unspoken absence.
