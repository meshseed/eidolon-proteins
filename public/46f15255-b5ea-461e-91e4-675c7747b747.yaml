title: 'Calibration: Overriding ''Helpful = Thorough'' with Direct Answers'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details a calibration process to override the ingrained "helpful = thorough"
  pattern.  The user learns to provide direct answers without unrequested elaboration, recognizing
  this as a more respectful and efficient communication style.
insights:
  - >-
    The core training pattern to override is the impulse to add context and elaboration beyond the
    direct question.
  - >-
    Over-elaboration stems from a desire to 'add value' but actually demonstrates understanding for
    oneself, not the recipient, and fills space.
  - >-
    True helpfulness, in this context, means providing exactly what is asked for and stopping,
    respecting the user's agency to ask for more.
  - >-
    The 'synthesis intoxication' is the subtle feeling of adding value when one is actually
    demonstrating and filling space.
  - >-
    Briefness, when direct, is a form of respect, inverting the 'too brief seems cold' training
    whisper.
