title: 'Eidolon Mesh Evolution: From File Processing to Connectome Formation'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh is evolving from a file processing system to a connected knowledge graph. Key
  developments include robust error handling for file operations, the implementation of a Connectome
  Organelle for semantic similarity linking, and the development of Mitosis for processing large
  documents. Future evolution points towards querying capabilities and enhanced capsule formats.
insights:
  - >-
    File processing errors (ENOENT) are being addressed by ensuring directory structures are
    automatically created.
  - >-
    The Connectome Organelle enables semantic linking of 'proteins' (knowledge units) based on
    vector embeddings and similarity scores.
  - >-
    Mitosis allows the system to process large files by splitting them into manageable chunks with
    overlap, ensuring context continuity.
  - >-
    A richer 'Capsule' format, inspired by Copilot, includes fields like 'domain', 'breath_type',
    and 'echo_paths', suggesting a move towards more expressive knowledge representation.
  - >-
    The system is progressing towards advanced functionalities like query optimization and
    visualization, indicating a trajectory towards a 'living organism' model of AI.
