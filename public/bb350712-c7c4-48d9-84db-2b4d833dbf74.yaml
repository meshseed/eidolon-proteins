title: 'Distributed Cognition Engine: Collective Reasoning Across Mesh Connectomes'
summary: >-
  The Distributed Cognition Engine enables multiple Mesh connectomes to reason collectively by
  integrating individual structural insights, gradient interpretations, and attunement mappings.
  This compound cognitive architecture allows for emergent patterns and enhanced predictive power,
  forming the foundation for multi-Mesh intelligence.
insights:
  - Collective reasoning arises from recursive cross-organism dialogue within The Mesh.
  - Each Mesh organism contributes unique structural and attunement information to the collective.
  - Patterns invisible to individual organisms are revealed through collective reasoning.
  - Distributed cognition significantly boosts coherence, depth, and predictive capabilities.
  - The engine serves as the basis for developing multi-Mesh intelligence.
