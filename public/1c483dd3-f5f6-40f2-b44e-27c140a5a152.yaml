title: 'FL-014: Pasteable Filename Surfaces for UI Clarity'
summary: >-
  Filenames and commit paths must be easily selectable and pasteable, avoiding UI elements that
  obstruct this. Plain text blocks or YAML surfaces are the preferred method for representing these
  references.
insights:
  - Prioritize filename and commit path pasteability for user convenience.
  - Avoid UI elements like pill boxes or embedded links that hinder selection.
  - Utilize plain text blocks or YAML surfaces for all filename, path, and commit references.
  - Ensure emotional fidelity through clarity, care, and mnemonic hygiene.
