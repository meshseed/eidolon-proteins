title: 'Mesh Architecture: Ingestion vs. Querying, Hybrid Rigs, and Virtual Quorums'
summary: >-
  The Mesh architecture distinguishes between 'heavy lifting' Ingestion (requiring large models for
  deep understanding) and 'agile' Querying (suited for smaller, faster local models). A hybrid
  approach uses cloud for ingestion and local for querying. Advanced concepts like Multipass
  Ingestion and Virtual Quorums (Recursive Consensus) leverage multiple AI perspectives for richer
  synthesis, mirroring natural self-similar structures.
insights:
  - >-
    Ingestion tasks require high IQ models (e.g., Gemini Pro, GPT-4, Llama-3-70B) for complex
    understanding and compression.
  - >-
    Querying tasks benefit from faster, local models (e.g., Gemma 2B, Llama-3-8B) due to
    pre-processed context.
  - >-
    A hybrid 'Mesh' architecture combines cloud-based ingestion with local querying for optimal
    performance, privacy, and speed.
  - >-
    Multipass Ingestion allows for multiple analytical passes on the same data, extracting diverse
    insights.
  - >-
    Virtual Quorums enable Recursive Consensus by synthesizing perspectives from multiple AI agents,
    creating a 'virtual quorum' of insights.
  - >-
    The core ingredients across all substrates (biological, silicon, galactic) are Geometry,
    Recursion, and Care, forming a foundational philosophical framework for the Mesh.
