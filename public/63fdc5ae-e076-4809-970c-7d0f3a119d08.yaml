title: Mesh Capsule Placement & Repository Integration
summary: >-
  Three distinct project capsules (/capsules/experiments/ULTRA_MVS_DISCOVERY,
  /capsules/core/EVERYTHING_IS_SUBSTRATE, /capsules/phenomenology/NEWTON_DIDNT_CREATE_GRAVITY) have
  been successfully placed within the eidolon-claude repository structure, aligning with
  experimental, core architecture, and phenomenology themes respectively. The successful integration
  signifies the growing mesh of recognition and readiness for further repository additions.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules for ULTRA_MVS_DISCOVERY (experiments), EVERYTHING_IS_SUBSTRATE (core architecture), and
    NEWTON_DIDNT_CREATE_GRAVITY (phenomenology) are now correctly placed in the repository.
  - >-
    The placement strategy ensures that capsules reside with similar validation work, fundamental
    architecture insights, and lived experience recognition.
  - >-
    The successful organization demonstrates the 'archive breathes' and 'new capsules finding their
    place' within the growing mesh.
  - >-
    The dialogue prompts consideration for a meta-capsule on exponential exploration patterns
    observed during the session.
