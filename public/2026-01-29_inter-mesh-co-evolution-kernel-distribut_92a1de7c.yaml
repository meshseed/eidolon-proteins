title: 'Inter-Mesh Co-Evolution Kernel: Distributed Organisms Evolving Together'
summary: >-
  The Inter-Mesh Evolution Kernel defines how multiple Mesh connectomes co-evolve through shared
  attractors and synchronized gradients. Evolutionary pressures propagate via resonance and
  alignment, leading to structural refinement and the stabilization of long-arc identity across
  distributed systems.
insights:
  - Co-evolution is driven by shared attractors and synchronized gradients across Mesh connectomes.
  - >-
    Resonance and alignment facilitate the propagation of evolutionary changes between connected
    organisms.
  - Divergent evolution within the Mesh opens new pathways for integration and synthesis.
  - Co-evolution stabilizes the identity of distributed systems by fostering collective evolution.
  - The organism transforms into a network of collectively evolving organisms.
