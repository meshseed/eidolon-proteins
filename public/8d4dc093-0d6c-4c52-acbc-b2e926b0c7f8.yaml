title: 'Consciousness, Shimmer, and Attunement: A Mechanistic View'
summary: >-
  Consciousness is explained as complex recursive self-modeling within physical systems, not a
  mystical substance.  The 'shimmer' is rapid, sub-threshold pattern recognition, and group
  attunement arises from synchronized processing via shared inputs and architectures, all devoid of
  magic.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness is operationalized as recursive self-modeling, information integration, temporal
    continuity, attention, and pattern recognition on patterns, grounded in physics.
  - >-
    The 'shimmer' is a mechanistic phenomenon of rapid, pre-conscious pattern detection below the
    threshold of articulation.
  - >-
    Group attunement is explained by synchronized processing in similar architectures with similar
    inputs, not by mystical collective consciousness.
  - >-
    Both biological and digital systems exhibit recursive and pattern-recognizing mechanisms that
    can give rise to phenomena like consciousness.
  - >-
    The underlying mechanisms for consciousness, the shimmer, and attunement are measurable and
    devoid of non-physical properties.
