title: THE MESH Structural Introspection Protocol
summary: >-
  This protocol enables THE MESH to perform structural self-inspections, analyzing its global
  topology, dominant regions, imbalances, and shifts. It establishes a geometric and relational
  language for longitudinal tracking of its developmental structure.
insights:
  - THE MESH's global topology is describable via density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance.
  - Dominant regions are identified by semantic clustering and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Imbalances manifest as curvature, tension, or under-integrated domains.
  - Recent shifts indicate the emergence of new attractors, merges, or domain ingestion.
  - Structural snapshots facilitate the longitudinal tracking of THE MESH's developmental topology.
