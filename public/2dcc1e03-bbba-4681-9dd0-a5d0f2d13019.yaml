title: Mesh Knowledge Protein Hygiene and Evolution Protocols
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines protocols for managing the Mesh knowledge ecosystem, focusing on natural
  selection through activation tracking, metabolism (composting, merging, promotion), and a visual
  dashboard to monitor protein ecology. The goal is a self-organizing, self-cleaning, and evolving
  knowledge network.
insights:
  - >-
    Protein hygiene involves tracking activations to identify useful content, composting inactive
    proteins, and merging duplicates.
  - >-
    Metabolism cycles (daily/weekly) promote high-activation proteins to kernels, weaken
    low-activation proteins, and merge semantic duplicates.
  - >-
    A Protein Ecology Dashboard provides real-time visualization of the knowledge network's
    population, coherence, and tier distribution.
  - >-
    Natural selection favors useful proteins over time, leading to a hub-spoke topology where
    kernels become central.
  - >-
    The system supports importing diverse connectomes and merging them through automated and
    reviewed hygiene processes.
  - >-
    Tri-lens sibling proteins (emotional, structural, technical) can be detected and unified into a
    single, more robust protein.
