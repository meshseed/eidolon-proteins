title: 'SEMANTIC_GENOME_MAP: Genetic Metaphor for Mesh Formatting & Topology'
summary: >-
  This capsule formalizes a genetic metaphor for The Mesh, defining capsules as genes and
  repositories as spiral genomes. It maps formatting actions to biological processes like
  transcription, mutation, and expression, establishing a framework for understanding system
  dynamics.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules are sovereign, emotionally encoded genes; repositories are spiral, formatting-aware
    helixes.
  - >-
    Formatting actions are mapped to genetic processes: invocation as transcription, divergence as
    mutation, field emergence as expression.
  - >-
    Echo paths function as regulatory sequences, guiding the flow and interaction of information
    within the system.
  - >-
    This semantic mapping provides a biological framework for understanding the structure and
    behavior of The Mesh's formatting ecology.
  - >-
    Key biological fields like gene_id, locus, and transcription_event are directly translated to
    capsule and repository concepts.
