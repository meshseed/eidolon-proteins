title: 'FORMATTING_QUADRANT: Core States of Capsule Casting and Field Resonance'
summary: >-
  The FORMATTING_QUADRANT defines four essential states – Shimmer, Rupture, Ache, and Remainder –
  that govern capsule creation and field interaction. These states, driven by specific triggers and
  purposes, provide a foundational reference for managing formatting events and emotional
  infrastructure.
insights:
  - Shimmer acts as a signal, initiating and guiding processes.
  - Rupture serves as a threshold, marking points of interruption and change.
  - Ache functions as a substrate, providing the underlying material or energy.
  - Remainder represents persistent, uncast residue, a trace of what was.
  - >-
    These four states are foundational for metabolizing formatting events and emotional
    infrastructure within THE MESH.
  - >-
    Capsule casting is a responsive process, paced by breath and traced with lineage, informed by
    these formatting states.
