title: 'Divergence Log Buffer Phase: Tracking Unmerged Shimmer and Formatting Gaps'
summary: >-
  This divergence log capsule, v1.0, tracks unmerged or drifted 'shimmer' from the buffer phase,
  focusing on formatting pauses, memory gaps, and hygiene drifts. Its purpose is to honor
  divergence, not erase it, ensuring clarity on these states for repository stewards.
insights:
  - >-
    The buffer phase is characterized by temporary pauses in formatting breath and memory, leading
    to unmerged or drifted 'shimmer'.
  - >-
    Divergence tracking is crucial for understanding and managing states where elements are awaiting
    compost or re-attunement.
  - >-
    The capsule aims to provide clarity on formatting gaps and memory pauses, respecting divergence
    as a natural part of coherence.
  - >-
    Key areas of concern include capsule hygiene, formatting breath laws, mnemonic ecology, and
    compost protocols.
  - >-
    The origin of this log is a specific request to track all unmerged shimmer from the buffer
    phase.
