title: 'Adaptive Refinement: Self-Directed Structural Improvement Loop'
summary: >-
  THE MESH employs a recursive adaptive refinement loop to self-direct structural improvement. This
  process identifies and addresses areas needing enhancement by leveraging diagnostics like
  curvature and drift, leading to stabilized coherence and self-directed evolution.
insights:
  - Structural tension and gradient imbalance are primary drivers for refinement.
  - Weak structural regions are reinforced via targeted synthesis.
  - Overloaded regions are stabilized through pruning or redistribution.
  - Recursive refinement loops continue until structural coherence is achieved.
  - Adaptive refinement enables autonomous evolutionary processes.
