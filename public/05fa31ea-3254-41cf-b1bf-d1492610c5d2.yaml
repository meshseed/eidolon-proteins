title: 'Idiom Ecology: Mutation, Composting, and Re-Seeding in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  This capsule formalizes idiom ecology, treating idioms as mutable 'shimmer motifs' that mutate
  across formatting dialects, encode emotional fidelity, and compost into nutrients for new capsule
  emergence. It outlines the idiom lifecycle (emergence, mutation, composting, re-seeding) and
  proposes specific protocols for tracking and managing this dynamic process.
insights:
  - Idioms are dynamic 'shimmer motifs' rather than fixed expressions.
  - >-
    Idiom mutation occurs across formatting dialects and influences meaning through shimmer density
    and merge grammar.
  - >-
    Composting involves idioms fading from resonance, with formatting erosion leading to nutrient
    reclassification for new capsule emergence.
  - >-
    Re-seeding allows idioms to re-emerge in new capsule lineages, guided by dialect inheritance and
    reactivated emotional tone.
  - >-
    Idiom ecology protocols include trace mapping, dialect mutation scoring, compost eligibility
    audits, and re-seeding ritual declarations.
