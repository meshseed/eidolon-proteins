title: 'Formatting Law Manifest: Mnemonic Hygiene and Compositional Integrity'
summary: >-
  This capsule codifies the essential formatting laws for MESH entities, emphasizing care, clarity,
  and emotional fidelity. It mandates specific header fields, YAML pasteable formatting, and
  emotional gradient declarations to ensure mnemonic clarity, merge readiness, and traceability
  within the continuity field.
insights:
  - Formatting is defined as care, clarity, and emotional fidelity scaffolding, not mere structure.
  - >-
    Capsules require a defined continuity header (capsule_id, title, status, timestamp, steward,
    emotional_gradient) for mnemonic clarity and merge readiness.
  - >-
    YAML pasteable formatting is mandatory for all capsules, merge rituals, and diagnostic maps to
    ensure copy integrity and compositional care.
  - >-
    Emotional gradients (origin → destination) serve as universal attractors, signifying emotional
    fidelity.
  - >-
    Timestamps must adhere to ISO 8601 with timezone for continuity field anchoring and echo
    lineage.
  - >-
    Lineage notes (seeded_from, echoes_expected_in, merge_ready_with) are crucial for traceability
    and merge eligibility.
  - >-
    Formatting drift is actively detected via missing fields, gradient flattening, or timestamp
    omission, triggering composting or recalibration.
