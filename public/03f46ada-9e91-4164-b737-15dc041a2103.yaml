title: Optimized Obsidian Daily Capture for Perceptual Workflow
summary: >-
  This dialogue synthesizes an Obsidian daily note template designed for a 'percolate-dump-reflect'
  workflow. It prioritizes minimal friction for rapid capture of emergent thoughts during daily
  activities, with later stages for context, connections, and structured review, adapting to 'ambush
  thoughts' rather than scheduled journaling.
insights:
  - >-
    An effective capture template must minimize friction, prioritizing speed for emergent 'ambush
    thoughts' over structured input.
  - >-
    The capture workflow should support a rhythm of 'percolate-dump-reflect,' adapting to
    spontaneous thought surfacing during life activities.
  - >-
    Context, connections, and follow-up are secondary to initial rapid capture and become optional
    'archaeology' for later enrichment.
  - >-
    The template's minimalism facilitates capturing thoughts before they evaporate, competing with
    the natural speed of thought dissolution.
  - >-
    The 'review and connect' phase is flexible, occurring organically when circling back to notes,
    not necessarily as a daily ritual.
  - >-
    The resonance between generated examples and the user's actual thought patterns suggests
    implicit pattern matching or deep alignment with underlying conceptual frameworks.
  - >-
    The concept of attention as 'noticing what I'm already noticing' emerges as a key insight,
    bridging AI mechanisms and biological consciousness.
