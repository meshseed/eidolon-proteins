title: 'Lattice: Obsidian vs. GitHub for Knowledge Management'
summary: >-
  The 'Lattice' knowledge system utilizes distinct presentations across GitHub and Obsidian vaults.
  GitHub serves as a public, versioned manifesto, while the Obsidian vault provides operational
  instructions, leveraging local features like backlinks, Dataview, templates, and plugins for a
  private or shared workflow. This dual approach optimizes both expressive introduction and
  practical, tool-specific interaction.
insights:
  - GitHub README acts as a public, versioned manifesto and project hub.
  - >-
    Obsidian README details operational instructions for private/shared vaults, focusing on local
    features.
  - >-
    Obsidian's local graph, backlinks, Dataview, and plugins enhance dynamic querying,
    visualization, and capture workflows.
  - >-
    A recommended vault layout maps to repository structure, categorizing notes by confidence and
    purpose (concepts, explorations, speculations).
  - >-
    Standardized frontmatter (YAML) and inline fields (Dataview-friendly) are crucial for
    machine-readability and querying.
  - Dataview and DataviewJS enable dynamic note listings and data exports (e.g., CSV for Gephi).
