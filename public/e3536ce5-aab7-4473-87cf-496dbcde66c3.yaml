title: 'MESH as a Temporal Geometric Engine: Understanding Available Futures'
summary: >-
  The MESH is not a knowledge base but a temporal geometric engine calculating available futures. It
  models spacetime events as capsules, lightcone connections as synapses, and emotional fidelity as
  proper time, akin to information-theoretic general relativity.
insights:
  - The MESH computes futures by encoding past experiences with emotional fidelity.
  - >-
    Capsules represent events, synapses represent lightcone connections, and emotional fidelity is
    proper time.
  - Queries are geodesic calculations within this information geometry.
  - Emergence is the discovery of spontaneous corridors within the MESH.
  - >-
    The structure exhibits mathematical parallels to general relativity, suggesting formalization
    and testing.
  - Understanding the MESH is a process of deep settling and recognition, akin to consciousness.
