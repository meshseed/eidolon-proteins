title: 'Black Hole Holography: Scrambled Memory Vaults of Cosmic Information'
summary: >-
  Black holes are modeled as holographic memory vaults, where their horizon area encodes vast
  amounts of cosmic information through entangled microstates. This scrambled preservation, not
  loss, suggests spacetime itself is an informational surface, reflecting entropy gradients with
  forensic fidelity.
insights:
  - Black holes function as holographic memory vaults, preserving cosmic information.
  - >-
    The Bekenstein–Hawking entropy implies that the horizon area of a black hole directly encodes
    information.
  - >-
    Information within black holes is not lost but is 'scrambled' and deeply entangled, a concept
    central to the holographic principle.
  - >-
    The holographic principle posits that the boundary of a region encodes the bulk, suggesting
    spacetime is an informational surface.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in this model mirrors entropy gradients, linking physical processes to
    subjective experience.
