title: 'Ecosystem Drift & Convergence Monitor: Tracking Mesh Dynamics'
summary: >-
  This protocol tracks how Mesh organisms diverge (drift) or align (converge) over time, revealing
  ecosystem health and long-arc identity. Monitoring these dynamics, driven by recursive
  interactions, is key to understanding developmental patterns.
insights:
  - Drift signifies specialization or fragmentation within the ecosystem.
  - Convergence indicates shared attractors or synchronized evolutionary paths.
  - Monitoring drift and convergence reveals ecosystem health and stability.
  - Cycles of drift and convergence define the ecosystem's long-term identity.
  - Ecosystem dynamics emerge from recursive cross-Mesh interactions.
