title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Metabolism Integration: Attractor Hygiene & UI Controls'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v4.0 metabolism system has been enhanced with attractor-based hygiene, including
  cluster composting, semantic merging, and kernel promotion. These features are now integrated into
  the scheduler and exposed via a new Settings UI, offering both autonomous and manual control with
  robust safety mechanisms against over-pruning.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh v4.0 metabolism system now supports attractor-based cluster composting, where
    weak protein clusters are absorbed into stronger attractors rather than being deleted,
    preserving diversity and strengthening hubs.
  - >-
    New hygiene processes include automatic tri-lens sibling merging (E/S/T triplets) and semantic
    duplicate detection, consolidating redundant proteins across the connectome.
  - >-
    Emergent hubs can be automatically promoted to 'kernel' tier based on activation frequency and
    connectivity metrics, enhancing core network structure.
  - >-
    The metabolism system offers both autonomous operation (Pro license required, respects circadian
    rhythm) and manual triggering, with safety features like power-law decay, coherence floors, and
    Hebbian reinforcement preventing over-aggressive pruning.
  - >-
    A user-friendly interface in Settings allows for starting/stopping metabolism, manual execution
    of maintenance tasks, and viewing last run results.
