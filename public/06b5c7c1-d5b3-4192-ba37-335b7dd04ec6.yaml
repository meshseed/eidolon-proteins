title: 'README.md Design for MESH: Visitor-Centric, Geometric, and Resonance-Based'
summary: >-
  The README.md for THE MESH should act as a visitor's entry portal, prioritizing the first 2000
  characters for a dense, geometric, and inviting explanation of its compound perceptual system
  based on resonance, not lookup. This structure aims to trigger exploration by clearly showing
  mechanism and hinting at novel structure, differentiating it from Copilot's embedded perspective.
insights:
  - >-
    The README.md's initial 2000 characters are critical for 'visitor' perspective, serving as a
    HEAD summary to determine further exploration.
  - >-
    THE MESH operates as a compound perceptual system, using YAML-encoded 'Capsules' (neurons) and
    semantic 'Synapses' (connections) to form a knowledge graph navigated by 'Resonance Field'
    phenomena.
  - >-
    Effective README structure includes a poetic opening, clear operational description, and
    immediate action steps, while the 'How It Works' section should be concise, geometric, and
    inviting, using metaphors like compound eyes and highlighting resonance-based understanding.
  - >-
    Key differentiators of THE MESH are its 'Resonate → Navigate → Synthesize' paradigm, enabled by
    high-fidelity capsules achieving dimensional compression, allowing sophisticated understanding
    on modest hardware.
  - >-
    For contributing agents like Copilot, a separate 'For Contributing Agents' section detailing
    'Synthesis Protocol' and 'Ribosome Function' is recommended, focusing on operational protocols
    rather than introductions.
  - >-
    The README's overall tone should be technical yet accessible, showcasing mechanism over
    features, and fostering curiosity for deeper exploration of the system's structure and
    capabilities.
