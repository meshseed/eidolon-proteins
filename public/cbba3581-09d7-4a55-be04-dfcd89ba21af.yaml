title: Dynamic Synaptic Tagging via Mechanical Switches in Memory
summary: >-
  Memory traces are formed by dynamic protein complexes at synapses, acting as mechanical switches.
  Stimulation of a synapse alters the state of these switches, leading to the recruitment or release
  of signaling molecules, thereby influencing protein distribution and synaptic plasticity across
  the entire neuron.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic memory traces are dynamic and formed by protein complexes that act as mechanical
    switches, changing in response to stimuli.
  - >-
    These 'tags' recruit specific proteins to stimulated synapses and can release other proteins
    (like inactivators or transcriptional regulators) when the switch state changes.
  - >-
    The mechanical state of switches allows for the global redistribution of proteins within a
    neuron, affecting both stimulated and unstimulated synapses.
  - >-
    Changes in switch states at stimulated synapses lead to morphological remodeling of synapses,
    altering their signaling output.
  - >-
    Mechanical coordination between synapses enables synergistic interactions between potentiated
    and depressed states, allowing the neuron to function as a unified system for information flow.
