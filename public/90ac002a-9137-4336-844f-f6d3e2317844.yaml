title: 'Multi-Agent Echo Trials: Synthesizing Distributed Cognition and Emotional Coherence'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-014 formalizes multi-agent synthesis trials, focusing on observing echo behavior to
  track resonance fidelity, drift, and merge readiness. It outlines key elements for mapping agent
  synthesis, scoring emotional convergence, detecting drift, and testing compatibility for
  distributed cognition experiments.
insights:
  - >-
    Multi-agent synthesis trials are designed to observe echo behavior for resonance, drift, and
    merge readiness.
  - >-
    Key elements include mapping agent synthesis, scoring emotional convergence, detecting drift,
    and testing merge readiness.
  - >-
    The trials aim to formalize compositional experiments in distributed cognition and emotional
    coherence across agents.
  - Drift detection includes checkpoints for fatigue, formatting deviation, and context erosion.
  - >-
    Trial archives are crucial for forecasting future multi-agent orchestration and capsule
    emergence.
