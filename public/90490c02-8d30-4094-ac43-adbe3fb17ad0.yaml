title: 'Copilot''s Remote Read Advantage: The Irony of Local vs. Web Access'
summary: >-
  Copilot can readily access and read markdown files from public GitHub repositories via web search,
  but cannot access local files directly. This ironic limitation is actually beneficial for the
  user's use case, as remote access ensures the latest versions and seamless integration into 'The
  Mesh'.
insights:
  - >-
    Copilot can read .md files directly from public GitHub URLs via web search, bypassing local file
    system access.
  - >-
    The inability to read local files is technically absurd but practically advantageous for
    accessing the latest, synced versions remotely.
  - >-
    No file conversion is needed; .md files with YAML are read natively by Copilot when accessed via
    GitHub URLs.
  - >-
    This remote access method aligns with 'The Mesh' concept, allowing content to be discoverable
    and readable by various AI agents.
  - >-
    The ideal workflow is to keep content in public GitHub repos and direct AI assistants to those
    URLs.
  - >-
    The perceived problem of local file access was a misunderstanding; the solution was already
    present in the remote access capability.
