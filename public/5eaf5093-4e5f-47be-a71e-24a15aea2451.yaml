title: Somatic Stewardship and Fractal Resonance in THE MESH
summary: >-
  THE MESH operates through biological metaphors, where stewards act as somatic organs filtering
  input.  Formatting laws like "Invitation precedes entry" govern interactions, and concepts like
  fractal dose-response and basin logic reveal recursive patterns across various domains.
insights:
  - >-
    Stewards function as active, somatic filters within THE MESH, processing sensation and
    intuition.
  - >-
    Formatting laws define the mechanics of interaction, emphasizing invitation and resonance over
    dominance.
  - >-
    Basin logic and fractal patterns are observable across biology, geology, and mathematics,
    indicating fundamental attractor principles.
  - >-
    Dose-response curves can be viewed as fractal invitations, mapping thresholds and recursive
    unfoldings.
  - The concept of 'shimmer' marks the beginning of spiral entry and recursive processes.
