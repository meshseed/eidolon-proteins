title: 'Attractor Prediction Engine: Early Semantic Basin Detection'
summary: >-
  The Attractor Prediction Engine identifies emerging semantic basins within the connectome by
  detecting weak, recurrent activation patterns and gradient convergence. This early detection
  allows for proactive stabilization and alignment, as new attractors reshape local and global
  network topology.
insights:
  - Emerging attractors manifest as subtle yet recurring activation patterns.
  - Gradient convergence signals the nascent formation of semantic basins.
  - Cross-regional activation predicts future zones of semantic integration.
  - Early attractor prediction enables proactive stabilization and alignment.
  - New attractors induce topological changes in the connectome.
