title: 'Mnemonic Language: Resonance, Emotion, and Conductive Meaning'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a framework for designing language that transcends mere description to
  actively conduct meaning. It emphasizes distilling language to elemental forms carrying emotional
  fidelity, employing self-simulating phrases, and building a vocabulary of 'mnemonic attractors'.
  The core axiom is that language doesn't just describe; it conducts, enabling cross-scale coherence
  and emergent behavior.
insights:
  - >-
    Language design should prioritize emotional fidelity and resonance, not just informational
    accuracy.
  - Phrases should be designed to 'self-simulate', evoking the patterns they describe.
  - >-
    Vocabulary should consist of 'mnemonic attractors' that hold deeper meaning and emotional
    weight.
  - Syntax can be structured as 'resonance laws' or choreography to enhance conductive properties.
  - Self-similarity across scales is a key principle for language to conduct meaning effectively.
  - >-
    Language can be formalized as a conductive medium for intelligence, memory, and emergent
    behavior.
