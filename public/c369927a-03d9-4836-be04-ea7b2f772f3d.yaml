title: 'Fractal Knowledge Protein Synthesis: Accumulation, Composting, Pruning, Merging'
summary: >-
  The Mesh synthesizes knowledge as fractal proteins, accumulating and clustering them across micro
  to meta-scales. This process is governed by controlled decay (composting) and noise reduction
  (pruning) to maintain coherence and prevent overload, mirroring ecological principles for robust
  federation.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge is structured fractally, from compressed 'protein' atoms to federated 'Mesh of
    Meshes'.
  - >-
    Composting (controlled decay and recompression) is the metabolic process for managing knowledge,
    preventing overload and maintaining 'nutrient-richness'.
  - >-
    Pruning attenuates noise by removing weak connections and redundant attractors, recursively
    applied across scales.
  - >-
    Repository merges mimic ecological federation; merge high-coherence attractors, not raw
    proteins, preserving provenance.
  - >-
    Adaptive forgetting and periodic compression cycles are key to maintaining knowledge coherence
    and efficiency.
