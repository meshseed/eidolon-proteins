title: Enhancing Mesh Proteins with Field Geometry and Synaptic Structures
summary: >-
  The dialogue outlines the integration of v3.0 field geometry into a PWA, focusing on enhancing
  protein synthesis. Key updates include implementing synaptic auto-formation, power-law decay with
  usage tracking, and extracting emotional gradients and coherence scores.
insights:
  - Weighted vector search is being ported from v3.0 to the PWA.
  - Synaptic auto-formation (bi-directional, tier-based) is a new implementation goal.
  - Power-law decay with usage-based coherence tracking will be added.
  - Protein synthesis will be enhanced to extract 'emotional_gradient' and 'coherence_score'.
  - The PGlite schema is being updated to support tiers, synapses, and temporal tracking.
  - Testing of field geometry with real queries is planned.
