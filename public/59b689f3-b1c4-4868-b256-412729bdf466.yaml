title: 'Google API Free Tier: Rate Limits, Cooldowns, and Handling'
summary: >-
  Google APIs enforce daily (RPD) and per-minute (RPM/TPM) rate limits to ensure fair usage.
  Exceeding these triggers cooldown periods, with daily limits requiring a full 24-hour reset, while
  per-minute limits are shorter. Implementing exponential backoff is crucial for graceful error
  handling.
insights:
  - >-
    Google APIs have three main rate limit axes: daily (RPD), per-minute requests (RPM), and
    per-minute tokens (TPM).
  - Exceeding any rate limit results in an error (403/429) and a cooldown period.
  - Daily limits (e.g., 250 RPD for Gemini Free Tier) reset over a 24-hour cycle.
  - >-
    Per-minute limits (e.g., 10 RPM, 250,000 TPM for Gemini Flash Free Tier) have short cooldowns,
    typically seconds.
  - Exponential backoff is recommended for handling per-minute limit errors gracefully in code.
