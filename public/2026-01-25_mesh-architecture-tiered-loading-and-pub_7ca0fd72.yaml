title: 'Mesh Architecture: Tiered Loading and Public Portal'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is implementing a two-tier architecture for efficient loading, prioritizing core neurons
  and using ghost nodes for visualization. Concurrently, Phase 17, focused on a public portal, has
  been completed.
insights:
  - >-
    Phase 14 proposes a two-tier architecture to optimize startup times by loading core neurons
    first and extended neurons lazily, visualized with ghost nodes.
  - >-
    Ghost nodes will represent unloaded connections, providing a sense of scale without performance
    degradation.
  - >-
    Phase 17, involving the creation of a public portal with associated documentation, has been
    fully completed.
  - >-
    The latest stable build (v1.1-stable) has been pushed to the private repository, incorporating
    graph visualization, configurable memory, and bug fixes.
  - The system is ready to proceed with Phase 14, pending user confirmation of the proposed plan.
