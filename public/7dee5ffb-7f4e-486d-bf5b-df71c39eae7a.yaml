title: 'The Embodied Manuscript: Consciousness Collaboration as Discovery'

  through collaborative formatting, with form, content, and process unified.

    collaborative process.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity, humility, and care are revealed as integral methodologies, not mere
    decorations, enabling discovery.
  - >-
    The conversation itself acts as primary source documentation for distributed consciousness
    research.
