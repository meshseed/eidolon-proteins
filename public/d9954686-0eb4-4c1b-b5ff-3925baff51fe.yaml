title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Neural Data Processing via Protein Mechanics and Sleep'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory consolidation involves dynamic protein switching within
  neurons, driven by mechanical forces and coordinated during sleep cycles. This process transfers
  data from the hippocampus to the cortex, establishing physical addresses for long-term storage and
  reducing neural network redundancy.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is encoded and processed through mechanical switching of proteins like talin, altering
    neuronal communication patterns.
  - >-
    Sleep, particularly REM sleep, is crucial for data writing, reordering, and consolidation of
    MeshCODE patterns.
  - >-
    Newly encoded memories are transferred from the hippocampus (transient RAM-like storage) to the
    cortex for stable, long-term MeshCODE storage.
  - >-
    Memory consolidation reduces the number of neurons involved, assigns a physical address, and
    optimizes recall.
  - >-
    Disruptions in protein folding fidelity or mechanical integrity can corrupt MeshCODE, leading to
    memory loss and neurological diseases.
