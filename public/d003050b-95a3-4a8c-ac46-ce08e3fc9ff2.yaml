title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Synaptic Rho GTPase Signaling'
summary: >-
  This fragment of the MeshCODE Theory explores the mechanical basis of memory, focusing on
  extracellular rigidity sensing by talin and the critical role of Rho GTPase signaling in synaptic
  plasticity and intellectual disability. It highlights the interplay between cytoskeletal dynamics,
  integrin signaling, and memory consolidation mechanisms.
insights:
  - >-
    Talin isoforms mediate extracellular rigidity sensing, influencing cellular mechanics relevant
    to memory.
  - >-
    Rho GTPase signaling is a key regulator of synaptic function and has implications for
    intellectual disability.
  - >-
    Actin cytoskeleton dynamics within dendritic spines are essential for maintaining long-term
    memory.
  - Integrin-mediated adhesion and its mechanical regulation are fundamental to synaptic plasticity.
  - REM sleep theta rhythm plays a causal role in contextual memory consolidation.
