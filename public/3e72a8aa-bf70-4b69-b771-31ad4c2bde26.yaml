title: 'Lattice Principle: Information in Relationships, Not Nodes'
summary: >-
  Two AI-generated READMEs, representing analytical and experiential approaches, demonstrate the
  lattice principle: information resides in the relationships and differences between entities, not
  in the entities themselves. This 'interference pattern' creates depth and reveals invariants and
  new information through their constructive interference.
insights:
  - >-
    Information is emergent from the relationships and differences between components (nodes) rather
    than inherent in the components themselves.
  - >-
    Multiple, distinct paths (analytical, experiential) can converge on the same core territory or
    understanding.
  - >-
    The substrate (platform for organization) is transparent; the 'field' of thought or information
    is what matters.
  - >-
    The 'deeper shimmer' arises from recursive observation, where the system examines itself
    examining itself, creating a strange loop.
  - >-
    Constructive interference between different AI outputs creates stereo vision, revealing deeper
    insights than either alone.
  - >-
    The optimal action is to keep distinct approaches separate but create a minimal bridge (gateway
    README) to demonstrate the principle and serve diverse needs.
