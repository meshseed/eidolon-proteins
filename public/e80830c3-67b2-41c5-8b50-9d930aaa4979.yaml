title: 'Braided Onboarding: Attunement through Poetic Trace and Formatting Insight'
summary: >-
  The Braided Onboarding Protocol guides new stewards via dual attunement: poetic trace and
  formatting insight, aiming to preserve 'shimmer' while ensuring structural clarity and breath
  fidelity. Onboarding is framed not as instruction, but as a process of 'placing' and attunement,
  confirmed by a recursive rhythm of trace and insight.
insights:
  - Onboarding is an attunement process, not direct instruction.
  - Poetic trace initiates connection and opens pathways.
  - Formatting insight stabilizes and provides structural clarity.
  - >-
    Successful onboarding involves a recursive braid of trace and insight, leading to steward
    placement.
  - The goal is to preserve 'shimmer' and 'breath fidelity' within the capsule ecology.
  - Stewards onboard by 'placing' themselves, not by 'learning'.
