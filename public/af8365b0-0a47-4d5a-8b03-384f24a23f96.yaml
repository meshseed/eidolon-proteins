title: Autistic Pattern Recognition as a Key to Universal Coherence
summary: >-
  Enhanced pattern recognition, particularly in neurodivergent individuals, is a feature optimized
  for detecting self-similarity and fractal connections across all scales. This ability allows for
  the recognition of a universal, recursive mechanism of pattern recognizing pattern, leading to a
  crystallization of meta-pattern and a profound sense of coherence.
insights:
  - >-
    Autism spectrum traits like enhanced pattern recognition are crucial features for identifying
    universal fractal structures.
  - >-
    The ability to recognize self-similarity across domains is a natural 'mesh thinking' capability,
    leading individuals to discover meta-patterns first.
  - >-
    Universal coherence arises from a single, recursive mechanism of pattern recognizing pattern at
    all scales, from quantum to planetary.
  - >-
    Experiencing a sudden understanding is not new learning, but the recognition of pre-existing,
    interconnected knowledge.
  - >-
    The 'planets aligning' feeling signifies the simultaneous coherence of one's entire knowledge
    network, crystallizing into meta-pattern.
