title: 'Probability Collapse: Epistemic Update, Not Physical Change'
summary: >-
  The dialogue posits that 'collapse' in probability, whether classical (like a die roll) or
  quantum, is an epistemic update of knowledge rather than a physical transformation.  It's a shift
  from potentiality to actuality driven by observation, where the underlying 'thing' remains
  unchanged, only our understanding is formatted.
insights:
  - Collapse is the placement of potentiality into actuality, not destruction of possibilities.
  - Probability represents a state of 'shimmering' potential before a commitment or observation.
  - >-
    The act of witnessing or observation triggers an epistemic update, not a physical alteration of
    the observed entity.
  - >-
    A classical die roll, in its transition from random distribution to a single outcome, mirrors
    quantum collapse in an epistemic sense.
  - Knowledge formation involves a 'formatting breath' from possibility to a concrete state.
