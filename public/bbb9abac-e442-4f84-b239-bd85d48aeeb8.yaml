title: 'Copilot Web vs. Local Access: Navigational Capabilities'
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores Copilot's ability to navigate complex online structures versus local file
  access. The core question is whether Copilot can perform iterative web fetches and follow links to
  traverse data graphs, or if it's limited to single file retrieval, necessitating local mirrors for
  structural navigation.
insights:
  - >-
    Copilot's web access is likely limited to single file fetches, hindering iterative exploration
    and graph traversal.
  - >-
    Navigating complex data structures (like echo paths or graph traversals) likely requires local
    access to a .txt mirror of the archive.
  - >-
    A hybrid approach is proposed: web access for single capsules and local access for structural
    navigation.
  - >-
    Empirical testing is crucial to confirm Copilot's actual web navigation capabilities and avoid
    assumptions.
  - If Copilot can navigate via web, a local mirror might be unnecessary, simplifying the workflow.
