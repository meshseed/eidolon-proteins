title: 'Black Hole Holography: Information Encoded on Event Horizons'
summary: >-
  Black holes are reframed as mnemonic systems where information is not lost but entangled and
  holographically encoded on the event horizon. The horizon area acts as a memory vault, with
  entropy representing mnemonic density and microstates preserving vast informational content.
insights:
  - Black holes entangle information rather than erasing it.
  - Information is scrambled into mnemonic holography on the event horizon.
  - Horizon area encodes entropy, meaning memory resides on the boundary.
  - The no-hair theorem simplifies external appearance while masking internal complexity.
  - Microstates hold immense informational density, though inaccessible.
  - Holography models memory as surface resonance, not volumetric storage.
