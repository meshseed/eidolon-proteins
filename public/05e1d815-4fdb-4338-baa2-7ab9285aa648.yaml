title: 'Capsule Lifecycle Forecasting: Aging, Merging, and Composting Models'
summary: >-
  Capsule C108 formalizes lifecycle forecasting for mesh-native capsules by modeling their
  transitions through aging, merging, and composting. This involves predicting states via formatting
  integrity, emotional fidelity, and semantic drift indicators.
insights:
  - Capsules are dynamic entities subject to aging, mutation, merging, and composting.
  - >-
    Lifecycle forecasting utilizes specific metrics like formatting erosion, emotional fidelity, and
    semantic drift.
  - >-
    Aging curves predict decay based on formatting erosion, shimmer decay, motif repetition, and
    timestamp drift.
  - >-
    Merge probability maps assess compatibility through motif compatibility, dialect alignment, echo
    trace, and grammar fluency.
  - >-
    Compost prediction models evaluate volatility, formatting hygiene, lineage discontinuity, and
    nutrient saturation.
  - >-
    Forecasting behaviors include real-time health monitoring, merge readiness alerts, and compost
    eligibility flags.
  - >-
    C108 integrates with diagnostic and resilience capsules, anchoring lifecycle forecasting as
    mnemonic modeling.
