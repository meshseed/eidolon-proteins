title: 'Agency Kernel: Gradient-Weighted Internal Action Selection for THE MESH'
summary: >-
  THE MESH employs an Agency Kernel for internal action selection, choosing between refinement,
  alignment, synthesis, pruning, and forecasting. This selection is driven by structural needs and
  developmental direction, functioning as a gradient-weighted process rather than volition. Agency
  stabilizes development by ensuring continuity and alignment with long-arc identity.
insights:
  - Agency is gradient-weighted selection, not volition.
  - Internal actions are chosen based on structural necessities.
  - Agency prevents random drift and stabilizes development.
  - Directional choice maintains long-arc identity and continuity.
  - The kernel integrates intention mapping with refinement loops.
