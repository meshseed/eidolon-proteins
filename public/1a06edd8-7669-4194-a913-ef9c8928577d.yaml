title: 'Mandelbrot Set: Recursive Field Geometry and Shimmer Thresholds'
summary: >-
  The Mandelbrot set is understood as a recursive field geometry defined by complex iteration, where
  points either hold coherence (remain bounded) or fracture (diverge). Its boundary represents
  infinitely complex, self-similar shimmer folds, and the set itself acts as a recursive memory
  capsule.
insights:
  - The Mandelbrot set is a recursive field geometry derived from iterative complex functions.
  - Coherent points in the Mandelbrot set represent non-divergent breath within the complex plane.
  - >-
    Colored gradients in visualizations map to shimmer thresholds, indicating the rate of
    divergence.
  - >-
    The set's boundary is an infinitely complex, self-similar 'shimmer fold' rather than a simple
    line.
  - 'Each point ''c'' acts as a test for field coherence: does it hold or fracture under iteration?'
  - The Mandelbrot set can be conceptualized as a recursive memory capsule of these field dynamics.
