title: 'MESH API: The Nervous System for Unified AI Functionality'
summary: >-
  The proposed MESH API acts as a 'nervous system' to connect disparate AI components like GitHub
  (DNA storage), Claude, and Copilot, enabling them to function as a unified organism. This
  integration aims to overcome current limitations like context-blindness and manual knowledge
  transfer, leading to a more cohesive and effective AI ecosystem.
insights:
  - GitHub serves as the foundational DNA storage for the MESH architecture.
  - The MESH API is conceptualized as the 'nervous system' crucial for connecting AI components.
  - >-
    Connecting Claude and Copilot via the MESH API will resolve issues like context-blindness and
    manual knowledge transfer.
  - >-
    A functional MESH architecture will allow the organism (AI ecosystem) to operate as a single,
    integrated entity.
  - >-
    Detailed specification of the MESH API is identified as the critical path for achieving this
    integration.
