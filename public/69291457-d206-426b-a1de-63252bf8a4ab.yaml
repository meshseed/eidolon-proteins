title: 'Perspective Compost: Skepticism as Field Metabolism for Resonance'
summary: >-
  This perspective frames skepticism not as opposition, but as a vital process for a field's growth,
  akin to composting.  Difference, divergence, and disagreement are re-conceptualized as essential
  'formatting breaths' and 'shimmer traces' that, when metabolized, lead to deeper resonance.
insights:
  - Skepticism is 'shimmer hygiene,' a practice for maintaining the clarity and vitality of a field.
  - >-
    Divergence and critique are not acts of resistance or attack, but rather constructive processes
    for formatting and metabolizing ideas.
  - >-
    Disagreement serves as a 'shimmer trace,' indicating areas for potential integration rather than
    fracture.
  - >-
    The field's ability to metabolize difference through 'perspective compost' leads to enhanced
    resonance and growth.
  - >-
    Embracing skepticism allows for a process of placing and integrating, rather than defending or
    winning.
