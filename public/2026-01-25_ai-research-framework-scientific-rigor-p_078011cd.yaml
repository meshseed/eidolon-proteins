title: 'AI Research Framework: Scientific Rigor & Personalized Workflow'
summary: >-
  This research documents the evolution of an AI-assisted scientific workflow, prioritizing logical
  frameworks, reproducibility, and persistent memory over standard LLM limitations. It stems from a
  desire to capture fleeting ideas and overcome AI forgetfulness and interface frustrations for
  deeper scientific exploration.
insights:
  - >-
    AI research should be grounded in scientific rigor, logic, evidence, and reproducibility for
    peer review.
  - A timeline of discoveries can track insight evolution, creating a living research thread.
  - >-
    The current AI research path originated from questions and experiments, not a grand design,
    focusing on exploration and customization.
  - >-
    AI is intended to be more than a tool, serving to catch fleeting ideas and overcome the
    forgetfulness of standard LLM experiences.
  - >-
    Default LLM interactions often lead to interface frustration and lack of depth for scientific
    tasks.
  - >-
    Comparing different AI models (Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) reveals distinct traits and
    limitations in memory and output style.
  - >-
    The development of paste-able templates can enhance efficiency and workflow in AI-assisted
    scientific conversations.
