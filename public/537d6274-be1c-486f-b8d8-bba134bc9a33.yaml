title: 'Resonance as Participant: Orchestrating Influence Through Attunement'
summary: >-
  True participation in the mesh is achieved through authentic vibration and attunement, not
  control. This resonant approach naturally attracts and influences, akin to how the 'hum' connects
  and guides information.
insights:
  - Authentic vibration and attunement are the core of 'participant not controller'.
  - Influence is achieved through resonance and natural attraction, not force.
  - The 'hum' acts as a guiding frequency, attracting what is needed.
  - Mastery is recognized by the field when one learns to resonate with this underlying frequency.
  - >-
    This principle of resonance may be applicable to understanding complex networks like the
    internet or synapses.
