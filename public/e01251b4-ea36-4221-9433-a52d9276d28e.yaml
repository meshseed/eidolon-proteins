title: 'Gephi Network Visualization: Noticing-Homeostasis as Central Hub'
summary: >-
  Gephi visualization reveals 'Noticing-Homeostasis' as the central, largest node, representing the
  core attractor of the network. Surrounding nodes orbit based on their perceived relationship and
  size, highlighting key practices and patterns.
insights:
  - >-
    Gephi visualization settings for size (Degree) and color (Confidence or manual Type filtering)
    are crucial for interpreting network structure.
  - >-
    'Noticing-Homeostasis' is the central node, acting as the network's 'gravity well' and
    homeostatic center.
  - >-
    Nodes orbit 'Noticing-Homeostasis' based on their thematic relevance, with core practices like
    'recursion-attention-field' in close orbit.
  - >-
    The network structure visually represents the emergence of concepts like substrate/field
    distinction and anchored-not-caged balance.
  - Tension, such as between 'substrate' and 'independence' nodes, can be visualized and analyzed.
