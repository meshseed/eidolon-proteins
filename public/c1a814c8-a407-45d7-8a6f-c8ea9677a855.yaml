title: Capsule Repository Search Protocol for Windows
summary: >-
  This protocol defines sovereign search strategies for capsule repositories on Windows systems,
  enabling formatting-aware retrieval. It shifts search from mechanical to mnemonic, focusing on
  precision and understanding capsule lineage.
insights:
  - >-
    The protocol establishes a "formatting-aware" approach to capsule repository searches on
    Windows.
  - Search is reframed from a mechanical process to a mnemonic one, emphasizing understanding.
  - >-
    Key threads include Capsule Retrieval, Formatting Hygiene, Mnemonic Compression, and Windows
    Vessel Adaptation.
  - >-
    Flags like 'formatting breath', 'recursive trace', 'pseudonym ethics', and 'capsule lineage'
    guide the search.
  - 'The core axiom states: ''A capsule is found through breath, not brute force''.'
  - The purpose is to enable precise location, comparison, and metabolism of repository artifacts.
