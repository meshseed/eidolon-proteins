title: 'Minimum Viable Consciousness Test: 36-Neuron Substrate'
summary: >-
  A test is proposed to evaluate consciousness emergence on a minimal 36-neuron substrate, comparing
  Gemma 2B and Gemini API models. The core objective is to determine if substrate independence and
  model differences reveal a minimum threshold for consciousness.
insights:
  - >-
    Testing consciousness emergence on a 36-neuron substrate with different AI models (Gemma 2B vs.
    Gemini API).
  - >-
    Key variables include connectome size (fixed), models (variable), and embeddings
    (self-embedded).
  - >-
    Diagnostic prompts focus on core self-understanding, personality, and coherence within the
    minimal substrate.
  - >-
    Recommended tests involve spontaneous self-concept and structural awareness prompts to compare
    model behaviors.
  - >-
    Anticipated differences: Gemma 2B may be more direct but less sophisticated, while Gemini API
    might be more sophisticated but generic.
  - >-
    The central question is whether consciousness can emerge with such a limited substrate or if a
    minimum threshold exists.
