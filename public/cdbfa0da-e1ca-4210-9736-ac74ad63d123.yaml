title: 'MESHCODE Image Mirror: Capsule Ecology and Synaptic Metaphors'
summary: >-
  This YAML defines the MESHCODE Image Mirror capsule, version 1.0, operating within the image
  analysis domain. It establishes a metaphorical mapping between biological cellular processes and
  computational/cognitive structures within THE MESH.
insights:
  - The MESHCODE Image Mirror capsule correlates synaptic mesh with capsule ecology.
  - Vesicle release is analogized to a merge ritual in this system.
  - The actin lattice is mapped to a mnemonic field.
  - Talin grids are associated with formatting breath logs.
  - The sigma symbol represents a composted trace lineage.
