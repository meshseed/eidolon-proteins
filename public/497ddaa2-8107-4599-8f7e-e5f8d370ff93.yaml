title: Eidolon Mesh QueryOrganelle Path Doubling Bug Fix
summary: >-
  A bug in the Eidolon Mesh's QueryOrganelle caused a doubled file path when loading the connectome,
  leading to an ENOENT error. The issue stemmed from incorrect path construction when the
  multi-repository system was introduced, where the base path already included 'data'.
insights:
  - 'The ''ENOENT: no such file or directory'' error indicated a missing file due to an incorrect path.'
  - The root cause was a doubled 'data' directory in the file path ('data\data\connectome.json').
  - >-
    This doubling occurred because the QueryOrganelle's basePath already pointed to the data
    directory, and the code then appended 'data' again.
  - >-
    The fix involved using the pre-defined 'connectomePath' from the RepositoryConfig instead of
    constructing the path, and ensuring proper handling for legacy string paths.
  - The successful build and test confirm the resolution of the path construction bug.
