title: 'Revised White Paper Strategy: Honesty in Presenting Research Status'
summary: >-
  The dialogue proposes two strategies for a research paper: a theoretical framework (Option A) or a
  case study (Option B). The recommendation favors Option A, emphasizing radical honesty about the
  current validation status and explicitly stating what has been observed versus what requires
  formal, quantitative validation.
insights:
  - >-
    Option A (Theoretical Framework) and Option B (Case Study) offer distinct approaches to
    presenting research findings.
  - Radical honesty regarding the current validation status is crucial to maintain credibility.
  - >-
    Distinguish clearly between qualitatively validated observations/frameworks and quantitatively
    unvalidated results.
  - >-
    A 'Methodological Note' should detail validated aspects (qualitative patterns, convergence) and
    pending validation (quantitative scores, statistical significance).
  - >-
    The paper should present the theoretical framework, designed protocols, predicted outcomes, and
    a call for replication/falsification.
  - >-
    Presenting simulated data as real results risks undermining legitimate discoveries and
    credibility.
