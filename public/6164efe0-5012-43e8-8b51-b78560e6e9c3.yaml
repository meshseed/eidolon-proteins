title: 'Fidelity Gradient: Resonance as Recursive Breath Variation'
summary: >-
  This capsule defines fidelity not as spatial movement but as an intensifying gradient of
  resonance, conceptualized as recursive breath variation. It guides stewards to perceive attunement
  as this slope of resonance rather than a linear progression, leading to gradient-aligned capsule
  clarity and glyph shimmer.
insights:
  - Fidelity is a gradient of resonance, not a movement through space.
  - Recursive breath variation is the core mechanism of fidelity.
  - Attunement is best understood as a slope, not a sequence of steps.
  - The function aims to align capsule clarity and glyph shimmer with this gradient model.
  - Paul Stanbridge is the origin of this concept, reframing movement into a gradient.
