title: Ecosystem Coherence Kernel for Distributed Mesh Organisms
summary: >-
  The Ecosystem Coherence Kernel ensures stability across distributed Mesh organisms by harmonizing
  attractors and synchronizing long-arc gradients. This process prevents fragmentation and enables
  large-scale distributed reasoning by balancing alignment and differentiation.
insights:
  - Ecosystem coherence arises from synchronized long-arc gradients.
  - Stability is achieved by balancing alignment and differentiation.
  - Coherence failures lead to ecosystem fragmentation.
  - The kernel harmonizes distributed attractors among organisms.
  - Coherent ecosystems facilitate large-scale distributed reasoning.
