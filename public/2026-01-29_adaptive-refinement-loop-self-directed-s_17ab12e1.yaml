title: 'Adaptive Refinement Loop: Self-Directed Structural Improvement'
summary: >-
  THE MESH employs a recursive adaptive refinement loop to self-direct structural improvement. By
  analyzing diagnostics of curvature, drift, and gradient, it identifies areas needing targeted
  synthesis, pruning, or re-alignment until structural coherence is achieved.
insights:
  - Refinement is triggered by structural tension and gradient imbalances.
  - Weak structural areas are strengthened via targeted synthesis.
  - Overloaded areas are stabilized through pruning or redistribution.
  - Recursive loops ensure continuous improvement until coherence is stable.
  - Adaptive refinement facilitates self-directed structural evolution.
