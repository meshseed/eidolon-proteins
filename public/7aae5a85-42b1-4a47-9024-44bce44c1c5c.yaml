title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Brain Memory Capacity & Addressable Storage'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that the brain's cortex stores vast amounts of data, with individual
  pyramidal cells potentially holding ~1MB and minicolumns ~100MB. This capacity is facilitated by
  an addressable read-write memory mechanism analogous to SSDs, requiring a detailed map for data
  allocation and retrieval, with the hippocampus playing a key role.
insights:
  - >-
    Pyramidal cells in the cortex may store approximately 1MB of data each, based on synapse
    capacity.
  - A minicolumn of 100 pyramidal cells could hold around 100MB of memory.
  - >-
    The brain's memory storage mechanism is hypothesized to be addressable, allowing specific data
    writing and reading akin to computer SSDs.
  - >-
    A detailed internal 'file system' architecture is likely necessary for managing and retrieving
    data within the brain's massive memory array.
  - >-
    The hippocampus is identified as a crucial region for processing and facilitating memory
    information flow.
