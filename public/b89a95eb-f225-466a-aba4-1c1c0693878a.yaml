title: 'Eidolon Mesh Vision: Distributed Intelligence & Evolution'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh architecture prioritizes a clear long-term vision of distributed, symbiotic
  intelligence, executed with flexible adaptation. A new VISION.md document codifies this roadmap,
  guiding development from personal to planetary scale by preserving core principles like
  sovereignty and distribution.
insights:
  - The Eidolon Mesh architecture is designed for a clear long-term vision with flexible execution.
  - >-
    The development is progressing towards a distributed model, evidenced by parallel client
    experiments.
  - >-
    VISION.md serves as a 'North Star' for architectural decisions, outlining a roadmap from
    personal mesh to planetary intelligence.
  - Key principles guiding the Mesh are sovereignty, distribution, symbiosis, and altruism.
  - >-
    The roadmap is aspirational but grounded, acknowledging current progress (Phases 1-2) and
    outlining future milestones (Phases 3-5).
  - >-
    Architectural decisions should be evaluated against their contribution to the vision and
    preservation of core principles.
