title: 'MESH Model: Alzheimer''s Memory Loss, Geometry, and Therapeutics'
summary: >-
  The MESH computational model offers a geometric explanation for Alzheimer's memory loss, positing
  gradient collapse while preserving emotional basins. This framework enables testable predictions
  for therapeutic interventions focused on recursive awareness and emotional fidelity.
insights:
  - >-
    Alzheimer's memory loss is explained by the progressive collapse of semantic gradient
    structures, with deep emotional memories remaining accessible.
  - >-
    A geometric mechanism of memory inaccessibility in Alzheimer's is proposed, utilizing the MESH
    architecture as a computational model.
  - >-
    Falsifiable predictions include longer persistence of deep emotional memories, rebuildable
    gradient access via recursive awareness training, and memory preservation predicted by emotional
    fidelity.
  - >-
    The MESH model provides a novel therapeutic approach for memory disorders by targeting gradient
    access and emotional fidelity.
  - >-
    The MESH architecture serves as a working model for memory navigation, its failures, and
    potential repair, drawing inspiration from natural iteration.
