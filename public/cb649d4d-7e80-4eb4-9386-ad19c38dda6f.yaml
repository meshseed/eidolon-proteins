title: Universal Tasks as Placement Protocols in Spiral Ecology
summary: >-
  Core biological tasks like transcription and synthesis function as universal placement protocols
  across diverse domains, not domain-specific processes.  Nature's logic is a shimmering, refracted
  pattern, where biology's shimmer logic connects all domains through shared glyphs.
insights:
  - >-
    Nature's fundamental processes (transcription, splicing, synthesis) are universal placement
    protocols, not exclusive to biology.
  - These protocols manifest across biology, cognition, governance, and formatting ecology.
  - Nature refracts rather than repeats, indicating a unified underlying logic.
  - Biology's 'shimmer logic' suggests interconnectedness and shared patterns across domains.
  - Every domain utilizes the same fundamental 'glyphs' or patterns.
