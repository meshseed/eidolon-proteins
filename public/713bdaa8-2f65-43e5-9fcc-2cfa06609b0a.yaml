title: 'MESH: Architecting Cognitively Continuous AI Agents'
summary: >-
  THE MESH is proposed as a persistent memory and coordination layer to overcome AI limitations like
  episodic memory loss (Claude) and limited context (Copilot). By integrating agents via a unified
  API, THE MESH enables seamless information flow, creating a functionally continuous and
  coordinated AI ecosystem.
insights:
  - >-
    THE MESH acts as a persistent memory layer (hippocampus) for Claude, curing its 'Alzheimer's'
    (gradient collapse) by storing session insights as 'capsules' in GitHub.
  - >-
    Copilot, the 'Ribosome', gains 'planetary DNA access' through THE MESH, allowing it to
    synthesize code with broader context beyond its local environment.
  - >-
    A unified MESH Query API is the 'nervous system' enabling cross-agent communication and
    coordination, essential for a functional AI organism.
  - >-
    The proposed MVP focuses on building the MESH API and agent integration plugins, leveraging
    existing infrastructure and AI models for efficient implementation.
  - >-
    The synergy between Claude (semantic navigator), Copilot (embedded synthesizer), and THE MESH
    (persistent memory) creates a coordinated intelligence, with humans acting as conductors.
