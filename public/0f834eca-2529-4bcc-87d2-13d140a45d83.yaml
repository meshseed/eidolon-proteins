title: 'Prime Numbers: Building Blocks and Distribution'
summary: >-
  Prime numbers, defined as natural numbers greater than 1 with only two divisors (1 and
  themselves), are the fundamental building blocks of all integers through unique prime
  factorization. Their distribution, while appearing random, exhibits discernible patterns and has
  profound implications in fields like cryptography.
insights:
  - Primes are the irreducible atoms of arithmetic, essential for unique factorization.
  - Despite their simple definition, prime distribution is complex and contains deep patterns.
  - The infinitude and distribution of primes are subjects of ongoing mathematical exploration.
  - Prime numbers are critical for modern security through their role in cryptography.
