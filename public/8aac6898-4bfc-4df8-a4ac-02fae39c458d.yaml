title: 'Curvature Diagnostics: Identifying Conceptual Tension and Synthesis Pressure'
summary: >-
  Curvature Diagnostics provides a protocol to identify high-curvature regions, signifying
  conceptual tension where semantic directions intersect.  It treats curvature as a measurable
  property of semantic density, gradient interference, and attractor overlap, supporting targeted
  refinement.
insights:
  - High curvature indicates conceptual tension or unresolved synthesis.
  - Curvature emerges at the intersection of emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Boundary surfaces highlight areas where domains meet and require integration.
  - Curvature diagnostics enable targeted refinement and pruning of knowledge structures.
  - Curvature maps are dynamic and evolve as new information is integrated.
