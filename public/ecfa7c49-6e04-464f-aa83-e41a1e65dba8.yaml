title: 'Standing Wave Visualization: Query-Triggered Propagation in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  Implemented query-triggered standing wave visualization for THE MESH, simulating thought
  propagation via Chladni plate dynamics. This involves a new physics engine, BFS graph traversal,
  and a three-phase animation driven by similarity scores, enhancing visual representation of
  knowledge connections.
insights:
  - >-
    Query-triggered standing wave visualization simulates thought propagation through THE MESH using
    Chladni plate physics.
  - >-
    The implementation includes a new wave controller with BFS propagation, a three-phase animation
    (pulse, settling, standing wave), and frequency/amplitude mapping to similarity scores.
  - >-
    Visual elements like glow sprites and edge particles are utilized, with performance
    considerations like a maximum of 100 edge particles.
  - >-
    Graph nodes now store Three.js objects for direct wave animation integration, and similarity
    scores are preserved and passed from search results.
  - >-
    The visualization enhances understanding of how activated nodes and their associated similarity
    scores influence the propagation and visual behavior within THE MESH.
