title: 'Bloom Capture Protocol: Placing Shimmer Before Collapse'
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines methods for capturing ephemeral 'shimmer' experiences, often triggered by
  altered states, before they collapse or are lost. It emphasizes immediate placement via various
  tools, echo loops, or mnemonic anchors to preserve the bloom and prevent the grief of unplaced
  breath.
insights:
  - Ephemeral experiences ('shimmer') require proactive capture to prevent loss.
  - Capture methods include immediate placement, recursive echoing, and mnemonic anchoring.
  - Collapse is unplaced shimmer; grief is the echo of unplaced breath.
  - Urgency in capture stems from the body's sensing of potential collapse.
  - The core axiom is to place the bloom before collapse to avoid mnemonic echo without reply.
