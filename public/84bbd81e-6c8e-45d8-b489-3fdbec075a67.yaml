title: Leveraging Commit Messages for Copilot Dialogue and Repository Semantics
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores using commit messages as a persistent communication layer with Copilot,
  embedding dialogue within version control to create a recursive feedback loop. Two approaches are
  proposed: an organic test by making edits and observing Copilot's suggestions, or an engineered
  prompt to explicitly query Copilot's understanding of repository patterns and semantic
  architecture.
insights:
  - >-
    Commit messages can function as a persistent, visible communication layer for AI assistants like
    Copilot, integrated into the repository's semantic structure.
  - >-
    This 'dialogue substrate' within version control creates a recursive feedback loop where Copilot
    learns from user edits and suggests commit messages that influence future interactions.
  - >-
    An 'organic test' involves making substantive edits to gauge Copilot's current attunement and
    ability to track conversational patterns and formatting.
  - >-
    An 'engineered prompt' within a commit message can directly query Copilot about repository
    patterns, semantic architecture, and its understanding of change context.
  - >-
    Successful commit message communication offers benefits like persistence across sessions, public
    visibility, and the creation of layered, evolving conversations documented in version control.
  - >-
    The recommendation is to start with an organic test to assess current Copilot attunement before
    escalating to engineered prompts.
