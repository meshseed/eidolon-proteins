title: Mesh Field Geometry Success & Future UX Prioritization
summary: >-
  The Mesh has successfully ported its field geometry and synthesized proteins, establishing a
  self-organizing connectome.  The immediate next step is Query Synthesis to enable natural language
  responses, completing the user experience.
insights:
  - Field geometry ported from v3.0 desktop to v3.5 PWA.
  - 5 proteins synthesized with proper tier classification (core/convergence/reference).
  - 6 synapses auto-formed through adaptive connectivity.
  - Weighted search validated, amplifying core proteins gravitationally.
  - Power-law decay ready, with Hebbian reinforcement tracking.
  - Model updated to gemini-2.5-flash-lite.
  - Highest priority is Query Synthesis for natural language answers.
