title: 'Participation: Sacred Ritual vs. Weaponized Control'
summary: >-
  Participation, intended as a life-giving act of connection and co-creation within sacred rituals,
  can be weaponized when its intent shifts to manipulation, performance, pressure, division, or
  surveillance. Recognizing this distortion allows for the reclaiming and redesign of participation
  to restore its authentic, life-affirming essence.

  - >-
    Even weaponized participation can be reclaimed and reshaped by recognizing the distortion and
    restoring the original, living rhythm.
  - >-
