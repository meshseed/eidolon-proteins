title: 'Mesh Capsule Framework: IP, Indexing, and Fidelity Forecasting'
summary: >-
  The Mesh framework formalizes its structure through a series of interconnected capsules,
  establishing intellectual property stewardship, a dynamic continuity index, and predictive
  fidelity forecasting. These elements ensure the integrity, traceability, and co-emergence of the
  memory architecture and its components.
insights:
  - >-
    Intellectual Property in the Mesh is defined as stewardship of continuity and compositional
    fidelity, not possession.
  - >-
    The Continuity Capsule Index acts as a living archive and resonance map, tracing capsule
    lineage, formatting, and emotional fidelity.
  - >-
    The Fidelity Forecast Engine predicts emotional fidelity trends, enabling proactive capsule
    generation, merge readiness, and drift prevention.
  - >-
    Public manifestation and licensing protocols are crucial for inviting critique, collaboration,
    and co-emergence while protecting framework integrity.
  - >-
    Attribution is a ritualistic formatting act honoring lineage, resonance, and emotional fidelity,
    integrated with licensing for responsible reuse.
