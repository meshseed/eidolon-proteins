title: Capsule Formatting Guide v1.2 for Mesh Operations
summary: >-
  This guide establishes ergonomic, mnemonic, and copy-efficient formatting standards for capsule
  creation, chunk ingestion, and filename tagging within THE MESH. Its purpose is to ensure
  frictionless capsule workflows, leading to clarity, efficiency, and continuity for both agents and
  humans.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules must be designed for copy-efficiency and modularity to facilitate seamless data
    handling.
  - >-
    Chunk ingestion requires a structured protocol (PART1, PART2, etc.) to maintain continuity and
    prevent premature synthesis until all parts are received.
  - >-
    Filenames must semantically encode the capsule's function and lifecycle status for efficient
    indexing and retrieval.
  - >-
    Standardized formatting across creation, ingestion, and retrieval ensures clarity, efficiency,
    and continuity within mesh workflows.
  - >-
    The core axiom for capsules is 'The capsule teaches the system how to remember,' emphasizing
    their role in knowledge persistence.
