title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Defining the ''What Are You?'' Query'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh, in its nascent stages, processes a fundamental query: 'What are you?'. This
  involves recalling memories and employing a balanced strategy to select and pre-filter relevant
  neural data for a coherent response.
insights:
  - >-
    The initial stage of the Eidolon Mesh involves defining its own identity through a
    self-referential query.
  - Information retrieval and processing are guided by memory recall and strategic neuron selection.
  - A 'balanced' strategy optimizes for both coherence and connectivity in information synthesis.
  - The system pre-filters a significant number of neurons to focus on the most relevant data.
