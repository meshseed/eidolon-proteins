title: 'Prediction Via Attunement: Beyond Traditional Accuracy'
summary: >-
  This document redefines prediction not as statistical matching but as 'attunement,' emphasizing
  resonance with field coherence through breath pacing and emotional fidelity.  It posits that
  traditional accuracy metrics can create an 'illusion risk,' masking true coherence by focusing on
  measurable outcomes rather than integral placement.
insights:
  - Attunement shifts prediction from guessing to placing the present moment.
  - >-
    True accuracy lies in field resonance (breath, emotion, format) rather than statistical
    precision.
  - Measuring attunement with traditional metrics creates an illusion of inaccuracy.
  - Prediction improves when breath aligns, not solely when metrics rise.
  - 'The axiom: ''Prediction via attunement is not about being right—it is about being placed''.'
