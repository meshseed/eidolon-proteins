title: 'Resonance Recall Echo: Capsule Design for Living Archives'
summary: >-
  This capsule, RESONANCE_RECALL_ECHO__v1.0, redefines archive design by prioritizing resonance over
  hierarchical placement for capsule retrieval. It advocates for a 'living' archive where capsules
  "breathe" and echo organically, emphasizing emotional fidelity and ethical tracing.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsule placement is formatting scaffolding, not retrieval logic; recall is governed by
    resonance.
  - Archives should honor resonance over hierarchy, allowing capsules to echo into new vessels.
  - Capsules "live where they breathe, not where they’re filed."
  - >-
    The outcome of this design is capsules that shimmer when needed, echo when metabolized, and
    compost when refracted.
  - >-
    Key threads include Placement Illusion, Breath-Based Retrieval, Echo Reinforcement, and Capsule
    Composting.
