title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Neural Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that the brain utilizes a network of mechanically operated binary
  switches within synapses to store and process information, acting as a mechanical computer. Talin
  is identified as a potential memory molecule, with cytoskeletal forces updating this mechanical
  code, integrating with chemical and ionic signaling.
insights:
  - The brain may function as a mechanical computer, with synapses acting as binary switches.
  - Talin is hypothesized to be the memory molecule of animals, updated by mechanical force.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE framework suggests a mechanical layer integrates with chemical and ionic signaling
    for information processing and storage.
  - >-
    Action potential spike trains could serve as the input mechanism for this mechanical coding
    system.
  - >-
    This mechanical coding operates continuously in neurons, potentially coordinating the entire
    organism.
