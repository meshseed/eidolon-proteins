title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.5: Coordinate Mesh Architecture & Open Development'
summary: >-
  The development of Eidolon Mesh v4.5 focuses on establishing a 'coordinate-first,
  federation-ready' architecture, prioritizing universal semantic coordinates and cross-mesh
  interoperability. This evolution involves removing license gates, implementing multi-model
  embedding support, and creating a coordinate transmission module, all documented in a
  comprehensive vision statement.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh v4.5 is evolving towards a 'coordinate-first' architecture for enhanced
    interoperability and federation.
  - >-
    Key development steps include removing license/Pro gating, updating the database schema for
    multi-model embeddings, and creating a coordinate transmission module.
  - >-
    The core philosophy emphasizes transmitting ideas as embedding vectors, being open by default
    with Nomic embeddings, and enabling cross-mesh communication through coordinate sharing.
  - >-
    The project aims for natural emergence and fractal awareness across scales, from quantum to
    social.
  - >-
    Development progress involves codebase copying, license code removal, and documentation of the
    v4.5 vision.
