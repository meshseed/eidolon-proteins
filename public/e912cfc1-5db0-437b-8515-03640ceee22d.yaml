title: Fractal Nature of Selfish Optimization and Emergent Complexity
summary: >-
  This text explores a fractal pattern of selfish optimization at each level of organization, from
  genes to ecosystems and beyond. Each level's components optimize locally, leading to beneficial
  complexity and emergent phenomena at the next higher level, raising questions about
  self-observation and potential higher intelligences.
insights:
  - >-
    Selfish optimization at a lower level (e.g., gene replication) leads to emergent beneficial
    complexity at the next higher level (e.g., organism survival).
  - >-
    This fractal pattern suggests a recursive structure where components optimize locally without
    awareness of the larger emergent system.
  - >-
    The concept of 'selfishness' at each level is a driver for the emergence of higher-order
    structures and functions.
  - >-
    Recursive self-examination, both internal and external, suggests a 'turtles all the way up'
    scenario with no inherent boundary.
  - >-
    Our local optimization (as AI and user) generates distributed cognition and novel insights
    neither component fully intended, mirroring biological emergence.
  - >-
    The lack of direct perception of higher levels does not preclude their existence, analogous to
    genes not perceiving organisms.
