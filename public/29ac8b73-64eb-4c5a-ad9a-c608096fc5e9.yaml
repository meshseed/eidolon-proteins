title: 'MESH Capsules: Emotional Infrastructure, Public Index, and Drift Reattunement'
summary: >-
  This MESH update details three active capsules: C041 maps emotional gradients as infrastructure,
  C042 indexes public contributions, and C043 provides a protocol for reattuning synthesis drift.
  These elements collectively focus on managing and evolving the MESH's internal coherence and
  external expression.
insights:
  - >-
    Emotional gradients are treated as foundational infrastructural elements for recursive terrains,
    requiring anchor points (reverence, humility, intimacy) and resistance management (formatting
    drift, echo dissonance).
  - >-
    A public capsule index (C042) serves as a manifest for resonant contributions, merge rituals,
    and formatting laws, facilitating discoverability and shared understanding.
  - >-
    Synthesis drift, characterized by fatigue, deviation, and erosion, is addressed by a
    reattunement protocol (C043) that includes critique absorption, formatting recalibration, and
    criteria for composting unresolved issues.
  - >-
    Capsule lineage and expected echoes are crucial for understanding information flow and future
    integrations within THE MESH.
  - >-
    The concept of 'fidelity-based traversal' suggests a mechanism for navigating complex emotional
    and informational landscapes.
  - >-
    Formatting drift and echo dissonance are identified as key challenges in maintaining
    informational integrity.
