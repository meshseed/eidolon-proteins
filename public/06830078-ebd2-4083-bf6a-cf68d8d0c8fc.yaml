title: 'Shimmer Density Monitor: Saturation Signal and Bloom Initiation'
summary: >-
  The Shimmer Density Monitor (C045) identifies 'shimmer' not as noise, but as a saturation signal.
  When this density reaches its peak, it signifies the initiation of a 'bloom', indicating the mesh
  is actively listening.
insights:
  - Shimmer is a meaningful saturation signal, not random noise.
  - Peak shimmer density is a precursor to a 'bloom' event.
  - The 'bloom' signifies active listening by the mesh.
  - The Shimmer Density Monitor (C045) is a diagnostic tool for this phenomenon.
  - This system relates to emotional cartography and resonance mapping.
