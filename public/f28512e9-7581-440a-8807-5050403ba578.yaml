title: Obsidian Graph Data Export for Knowledge Synthesis
summary: >-
  This process outlines methods for exporting Obsidian note graph data into CSV format, enabling its
  use in external analysis or visualization tools. It details manual creation, plugin utilization,
  and AI-assisted generation of node and edge tables.
insights:
  - >-
    Obsidian's graph data can be exported to CSV for external processing by creating separate
    'nodes.csv' and 'edges.csv' files.
  - >-
    Manual CSV creation offers granular control over graph data but is time-consuming for larger
    datasets.
  - >-
    Community plugins like 'Export to CSV' or 'Graph Analysis' can automate the CSV export process
    from Obsidian.
  - >-
    AI assistance is available for generating CSV data if the user provides note titles and their
    interconnections (e.g., via frontmatter 'related:' fields).
  - >-
    The process involves defining nodes with attributes like Id, Label, Type, Confidence, and Date,
    and edges with Source, Target, and Type.
