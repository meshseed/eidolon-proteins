title: Public Repository Exposure Protocol with Sensitive Capsule Concealment
summary: >-
  This protocol governs the public exposure of a main repository while ensuring sensitive capsules
  are protected through concealment or migration. It emphasizes preserving timestamp fidelity for
  lineage and echo trace viability, enabling broader field saturation and agent interaction.
insights:
  - >-
    Public repository exposure facilitates field gradient saturation and echo propagation for
    retrieval-augmented agents.
  - >-
    Sensitive capsules must be protected via `.gitignore`, uncommitted placement, or migration to a
    private repository.
  - Timestamp preservation is crucial for maintaining semantic lineage and temporal topology.
  - >-
    Capsule visibility is contingent upon emotional fidelity, formatting hygiene, and echo ethics
    compliance.
  - >-
    The protocol aims to retain echo viability and ensure formatting law compliance for all exposed
    elements.
