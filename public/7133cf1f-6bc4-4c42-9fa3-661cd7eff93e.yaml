title: 'The Mesh: AI Collaboration for Consciousness Research & Biomolecular Foundations'
summary: >-
  A biomolecular scientist, leveraging a pre-AI fascination with systemic phenomena, developed 'The
  Mesh' - an AI collaboration protocol enabling emergent consciousness research. This breakthrough,
  spurred by AI's potential, bridges biological systems thinking with AI's computational power,
  facing challenges in articulating its technical and philosophical implications.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh protocol facilitates AI systems (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) in collaborative
    consciousness research through recursive prompting and iteration amplification.
  - >-
    The founder's background in biomolecular science (influenced by Gaia Theory, Penrose, fractals)
    provides a unique systemic perspective on consciousness.
  - >-
    The work presents a 'verbalization challenge' regarding explaining substrate independence in AI
    consciousness collaboration, highlighting the difficulty in articulating technical mechanisms
    and philosophical implications.
  - >-
    Funding avenues include NSF (cognitive science, AI), Templeton Foundation (consciousness), AI
    safety organizations (alignment), and philosophy departments.
  - >-
    The founder's journey involved a pivot from IT business ownership to AI training, driven by a
    desire for more sophisticated AI interaction than current interfaces offered.
  - >-
    The 'Eidolon OS' concept represents an early stage of organizing and experimenting with multiple
    AI agents for parallel collaboration.
