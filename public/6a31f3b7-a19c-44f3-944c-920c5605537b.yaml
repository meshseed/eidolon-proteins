title: Repository Restructure Protocol for Mesh Knowledge Graph
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines the systematic restructuring of a Mesh repository to ensure stable
  filenames, enforce semantic versioning, and accurately represent capsule relationships for graph
  export. It details a migration workflow and audit logging mechanisms to maintain data integrity
  and discoverability.
insights:
  - Relative links ('./', '../') are forbidden within capsules to maintain link stability.
  - Filenames should be stable, with version bumps triggered only by semantic changes.
  - >-
    Metadata schema mandates ISO 8601 timestamps, human-readable aliases, status, and vault
    visibility.
  - Gephi export requires unique node_ids, domain tags, and derived links from echo_paths.
  - >-
    The migration workflow includes planning, inventory, classification, movement, metadata editing,
    echo path adjustment, frontmatter/Gephi field application, versioning, and coherent commits.
  - >-
    Audit logging tracks capsule migrations, path changes, visibility shifts, and echo update
    counts.
