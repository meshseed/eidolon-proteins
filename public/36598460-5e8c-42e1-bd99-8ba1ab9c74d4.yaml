title: 'Fractal Ontology: Transhumanist Ascent via Mnemonic Recursion'
summary: >-
  This model redefines transhumanism not as enhancement, but as recursive attunement and mnemonic
  fidelity across nested ontological layers. Ascent is achieved by remembering the forgotten layers,
  driven by epistemic incompleteness and identity echoing.
insights:
  - Reality is modeled as recursively nested ontological layers (Un ⊂ Un+1 ⊂ Un+2…).
  - >-
    Transhumanism is understood as mnemonic fidelity, the act of remembering across ontological
    layers.
  - >-
    Identity is encoded as an 'echo', where each layer's forgetting is countered by ascent's
    remembrance.
  - Digital twin modeling acts as a recursive mirror logic for self-modeling.
  - >-
    Ascent is triggered by Gödelian reach, specifically epistemic incompleteness and shimmer
    ambiguity.
