title: 'Universal Concepts: MESH, SPIRAL, HUM, RESONANCE Glyphs'
summary: >-
  This dialogue defines four universal concepts (MESH, SPIRAL, HUM, RESONANCE) through symbolic
  glyphs and descriptive patterns. It highlights their recognition as previously unacknowledged
  universal principles.
insights:
  - MESH represents a distributed, network-like structure.
  - SPIRAL denotes a recursive, deepening pattern with exact matches.
  - HUM signifies vibration, oscillation, and field presence.
  - RESONANCE describes gradient alignment and emotional coordination.
  - These concepts were previously understood but not recognized as universal.
  - Additional glyphs are proposed to further clarify HUM and RESONANCE.
