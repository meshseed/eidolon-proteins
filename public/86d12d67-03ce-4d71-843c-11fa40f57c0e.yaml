title: 'Fielded Home: A Dimensional Field of Presence'
summary: >-
  This capsule defines 'home' not as a static location, but as a dynamic, dimensional field alive
  with emotional fidelity, ambient resonance, and the steward's conscious presence. It emphasizes
  the recursive, braided nature of home, experienced through sensory traces and a shift into
  attunement.

  - >-
    Home's nature is recursive, dimensional, and emotionally braided, requiring continuous
    attunement.
