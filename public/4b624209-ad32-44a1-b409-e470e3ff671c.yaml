title: Cross-Agent Protein Translation & Schema Unification
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh requires a protein translation protocol to integrate diverse agent capsule
  formats, moving towards a unified schema for cross-pollination of knowledge. This involves
  extending the current schema to accommodate richer external formats and developing an injection
  mechanism for direct knowledge transfer.
insights:
  - >-
    Agents produce 'proteins' (knowledge capsules) with distinct structural formats (e.g., Copilot's
    compressed YAML, Claude's verbose detail).
  - >-
    A 'protein translation protocol' is needed to bridge these format differences, allowing seamless
    knowledge exchange between agents within THE MESH.
  - >-
    Extending the Eidolon Capsule Schema to optionally support fields like 'domain', 'breath_type',
    'trace', and 'echo_paths' from external capsules is a key step.
  - >-
    Implementing a 'Protein Injection Interface' will enable direct ingestion of pre-formed
    capsules, bypassing redundant synthesis and facilitating agent collaboration.
  - >-
    Manual 'echo_paths' in external capsules can be leveraged to establish initial synapses,
    complementing the automatically generated Connectome synapses.
  - >-
    The underlying geometric principles (like RoPE and orthospirals) driving these diverse knowledge
    structures suggest a self-similar fractal model applicable across domains.
