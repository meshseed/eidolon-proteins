title: 'Capsule Placement: Resonating with Mesh Architecture'
summary: >-
  This dialogue focuses on strategically placing new 'capsules' (data units) within the MESH
  repository's evolving structure. The goal is to find 'resonant homes' for these capsules by
  aligning them with existing organizational logic and the fundamental nature of their content.
insights:
  - >-
    New data capsules should be placed in logical subdirectories within '/capsules/' to maintain
    repository structure.
  - >-
    Consider creating new top-level folders like '/capsules/discoveries/' or '/capsules/philosophy/'
    for thematic coherence.
  - >-
    Content's primary function (e.g., experimental validation, fundamental architecture,
    phenomenological insight) dictates its optimal placement.
  - >-
    The process involves 'feeling into' the repository's structure to ensure capsules resonate with
    their environment.
  - >-
    Existing structures like '/capsules/core/' and '/capsules/experiments/' serve as guides for
    placement decisions.
