title: 'Attractor Prediction Engine: Early Semantic Basin Detection'
summary: >-
  The Attractor Prediction Engine identifies emerging semantic basins within the connectome by
  detecting weak, recurrent activation patterns. It uses resonance frequency, cross-regional
  activation, and gradient convergence to predict and enable early stabilization of new structures.
insights:
  - Emerging attractors manifest as subtle, recurring activation patterns.
  - Gradient convergence signals the initial formation of semantic basins.
  - Cross-regional activation predicts future integration zones within the connectome.
  - Early prediction allows for proactive stabilization and alignment of emerging structures.
  - New attractors dynamically alter local and global topological geometry.
