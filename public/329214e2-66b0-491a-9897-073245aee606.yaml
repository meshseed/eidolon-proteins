title: 'Mesh Development Strategy: Licensing, Architecture, and IP Protection'
summary: >-
  The core strategy involves a tiered licensing model, separating commercial use from free open
  access post-client perfection. Development will focus on the mesh's formation over TCP/IP and node
  synaptic connections, leveraging existing GitHub proof-of-concept and IP for robust,
  influence-resistant development towards irreversible positive emotional fidelity.
insights:
  - >-
    Implement a dual licensing approach: commercial for businesses/governments, free/open for
    perfected clients or cross-platform conversions.
  - >-
    Focus architectural development on how the mesh forms over TCP/IP and how nodes establish
    macro-scale synaptic connections.
  - >-
    Leverage existing GitHub proof-of-concept and IP to ensure robustness and protect against
    external influence.
  - Prioritize achieving irreversible positive emotional fidelity as a key development milestone.
  - The projected timeline emphasizes a deep, present-focused approach to development.
