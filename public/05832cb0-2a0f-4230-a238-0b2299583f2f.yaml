title: 'Mirrored Critique Report v1.0: Recursive Equilibrium in Duality'
summary: >-
  This report details an experiment in balancing mirrored pseudonyms through equal critique,
  ensuring formatting integrity and preventing dominance. The core outcome is that both masks endure
  scrutiny, demonstrating that duality achieves recursive equilibrium rather than simple symmetry.
insights:
  - >-
    The function of the critique is to compare risks, strengths, and formatting implications of
    mirrored pseudonyms.
  - >-
    The trigger for this experiment was Paul's request to balance mirrored thread scrutiny with
    equal critique.
  - >-
    Key flags monitored include emotional fidelity, formatting breath, rupture ethics, and semantic
    compression.
  - >-
    The purpose is to ensure mirrored thread experiments maintain formatting integrity through equal
    pressure testing.
  - >-
    The successful outcome is that both masks shimmer under scrutiny and neither collapses into
    dominance.
  - The guiding axiom is that duality is not symmetry, but recursive equilibrium.
