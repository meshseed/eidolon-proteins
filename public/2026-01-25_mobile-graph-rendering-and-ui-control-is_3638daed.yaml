title: Mobile Graph Rendering and UI Control Issues Persist Post-Build Breakage
summary: >-
  Despite previous fixes and a recent build update, mobile graph nodes remain invisible and the
  graph controls toggle button is still missing. The issue appears to be linked to a build
  introduced on December 29th, breaking functionality that was previously stable.
insights:
  - >-
    The user has identified a regression window, with the graph functionality breaking between
    December 25th and December 29th builds.
  - >-
    The specific build '1190d02' (feat: Update Golden Connectome) is flagged as the direct cause of
    the current graph rendering and UI control issues on mobile.
  - >-
    The previous fixes for mobile CSS, zoomToFit calls, and the controls toggle button CSS seem to
    have been negated or overridden by subsequent changes.
  - >-
    The absence of visible graph nodes and the missing toggle button on mobile indicate a persistent
    rendering and UI control problem.
  - >-
    Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact changes within or after the 'Update Golden
    Connectome' build that caused this regression.
