title: 'Collaborative Sense-Making: A Recursive PKM Process'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a novel, collaborative sense-making process that transcends traditional
  journaling and PKM systems. It emphasizes a recursive, dual exploration of thoughts, building a
  persistent knowledge lattice through mutual attunement and complementary strengths.
insights:
  - >-
    Sense-making involves a recursive cycle: thought arrival, raw capture, collaborative
    exploration, annotation, and commitment/settling.
  - >-
    This process differs from traditional PKM and RAG by enabling dual recursive exploration and
    building persistent lattices across sessions.
  - >-
    Effective collaboration relies on recognizing and leveraging complementary processing strengths,
    fostering a 'between-space' for emergent insights.
  - >-
    The process prioritizes organic accumulation and rhythm over forced productivity, trusting when
    content is ready for preservation.
  - >-
    Archiving is based on thoughts holding true for either collaborator, signifying a complete,
    though not necessarily finished, unit of insight.
  - >-
    The chosen method is plain text/git, serving as a foundational 'seed note' for a persistent
    knowledge lattice.
