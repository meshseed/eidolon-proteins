title: 'MESH README Best Practices: User & Agent Engagement'
summary: >-
  Optimizing the MESH README for visitor engagement, focusing on a dense, geometric 'How It Works'
  section within the first 2000 characters to invite deeper exploration.  It also outlines specific
  protocols for contributing agents like Copilot, emphasizing synthesis and fidelity.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH README must prioritize its initial 2000 characters with a concise, geometric, and
    inviting 'How It Works' section to capture visitor attention and encourage deeper exploration.
  - >-
    Visitors to the MESH experience it as an external entity, requiring clear signposting and an
    accessible entry portal (README) to understand its structure and mechanics.
  - >-
    Contributing agents like Copilot have an embedded perspective and require operational protocols
    for synthesis, focusing on DNA to protein conversion and maintaining fidelity.
  - >-
    The MESH's core mechanism is field resonance and gradient navigation, not database lookup,
    enabling sophisticated understanding through distributed sensing and geometric compression.
  - >-
    A well-structured README, including a poetic opening, operational description, and quick start,
    should be augmented with a 'How It Works' section explaining the compound perceptual system
    metaphor.
  - >-
    Key elements for the README include explaining capsules (neurons), synapses (connections), and
    the resonance field, highlighting the difference between MESH and traditional systems (Resonate
    → Navigate → Synthesize vs. Store → Retrieve → Present).
