title: 'Mesh Neuron Loading: Performance vs. Completeness Trade-offs'
summary: >-
  Optimizing the loading and querying of Mesh neurons involves a fundamental trade-off between
  startup speed/memory usage and the completeness of the network's connectome. Strategies like
  percentage-based loading, tiered architectures, and 'ghost nodes' aim to balance these competing
  demands for scalable performance.
insights:
  - >-
    Loading all neurons provides a complete connectome but incurs slow startup and high memory
    usage, hindering scalability.
  - >-
    Loading a subset of neurons improves startup speed and memory efficiency but results in an
    incomplete graph and potential loss of connections.
  - >-
    Percentage-based loading (e.g., top 20% by coherence) scales automatically with archive growth
    and offers configurable performance.
  - >-
    A two-tier system (core always loaded, extended lazy-loaded) allows for fast initial queries
    while enabling deep dives on demand.
  - >-
    Visualizing incomplete connectomes can be improved with 'ghost nodes' representing unloaded
    connections and their count.
  - >-
    Adaptive scaling mechanisms can dynamically adjust loading percentages based on observed
    performance metrics (e.g., load time) to meet target parameters.
  - >-
    Stratified loading by quality tiers allows for different query modes to access varying levels of
    network detail.
