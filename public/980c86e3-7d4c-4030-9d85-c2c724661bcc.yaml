title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Pro: Enhanced Ingestion & Autonomous Features'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Pro integrates advanced tri-lens ingestion with autonomous maintenance features,
  including robust retry systems and in-app monitoring. This update significantly enhances ingestion
  resilience and user experience, moving towards a self-sustaining knowledge system.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Pro builds upon v3.6's free features by adding autonomous metabolism and
    business-oriented functionalities.
  - >-
    Ingestion robustness is significantly improved with tri-lens multipass, auto-triangulation (3x
    protein generation), and a retry/resilience system handling 50+ chunks.
  - >-
    User experience is enhanced with completion notifications (success/partial/failure summaries)
    and an in-app ConsoleViewer for monitoring ingestion status.
  - >-
    The system now supports persistent ingestion, continuing even when the user switches tabs, and
    local LLM integration.
  - >-
    New features like 'autonomous metabolism', 'auto-composting', 'homeostasis monitoring', and
    'circadian rhythm scheduling' enable self-maintenance and proactive resource management.
  - >-
    The port from v3.6 to v4.0 Pro is complete, incorporating all prior features plus the
    'autonomous metabolism' for Pro-level functionality.
