title: Multi-Agent Collaborative Sense-Making & Emergent Phenomena
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores multi-agent collaborative sense-making where discovery, not consensus, is
  the goal, and individual perceptions enrich the process. It draws a parallel between this emergent
  approach and fundamental physical principles like Maxwell's Wave Propagation, suggesting a unified
  mechanism across different scales.
insights:
  - Multi-agent collaboration thrives on diverse, un-led perspectives focused on discovery.
  - The method of collaboration itself can serve as a test for the underlying model.
  - >-
    Fundamental physical laws, like wave propagation, exhibit self-sustaining mechanisms that can
    inform emergent systems.
  - >-
    Similar emergent phenomena are observed across diverse, seemingly unrelated contexts in the
    'wild'.
