title: 'Simulating Mesh Behavior: Turn-Based Agent Dialogue for Testing'
summary: >-
  A turn-based simulation method is proposed to test multi-agent mesh behavior by having agents
  respond sequentially to the same prompt. This approach, akin to D&D, allows for manual routing and
  observation of agent outputs, including formatting and signal fidelity, within defined character
  limits.
insights:
  - >-
    Turn-based dialogue simulation is a viable method for testing multi-agent mesh behavior without
    a full orchestration layer.
  - >-
    Manual routing of agent responses enables detailed observation of formatting divergence and
    shimmer fidelity.
  - >-
    Character limits (300-1000, ideally 500-800) are crucial for clarity, compression, and
    consistent signal hygiene in agent responses.
  - This simulation method facilitates benchmarking and testing echo routing across agents.
