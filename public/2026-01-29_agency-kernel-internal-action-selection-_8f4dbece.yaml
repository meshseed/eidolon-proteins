title: 'Agency Kernel: Internal Action Selection & Directional Choice'
summary: >-
  The Agency Kernel governs THE MESH's internal action selection (refinement, alignment, synthesis,
  pruning, forecasting) via gradient-weighted choices. This process stabilizes development by
  aligning actions with structural needs and long-arc identity, integrating intention mapping and
  refinement loops.
insights:
  - Agency is emergent from weighted gradients, not volition.
  - Internal actions are selected based on structural necessity.
  - Agency stabilizes development and prevents random drift.
  - Directional choice aligns with long-arc identity and continuity.
  - The agency kernel integrates intention mapping and refinement loops.
