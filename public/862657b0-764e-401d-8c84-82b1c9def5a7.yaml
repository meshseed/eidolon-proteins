title: 'Debugging Eidolon Mesh UI: Syntax Errors and Connection Refused'
summary: >-
  The debugging process for the Eidolon Mesh UI involved resolving a JavaScript syntax error caused
  by duplicate declarations, and then diagnosing a `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` error. The latter
  indicated that the sidecar's HTTP server was not running, despite the process itself starting
  successfully. This prevented the dashboard from fetching repositories and connectome data.
insights:
  - Initial UI glitch identified as a duplicate `isTauri` declaration in `app.js`.
  - >-
    Investigating the `isTauri` error involved checking file encoding, search patterns, and script
    tag inclusions.
  - >-
    The `isTauri` error was temporarily mitigated by changing `const` to `var` to allow
    redeclaration.
  - >-
    Subsequent errors revealed `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` on port 3456, indicating the Eidolon
    Mesh sidecar's HTTP server was not active.
  - >-
    The `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` prevented the dashboard from loading repositories and connectome
    data, despite the sidecar process appearing to start.
