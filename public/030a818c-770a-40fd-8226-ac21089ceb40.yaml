title: 'M.E.S.H. Intelligence: Phased Development and Performance Transparency'
summary: >-
  The M.E.S.H. is evolving through phased implementation, prioritizing conversation memory and
  strategy selection. A key focus is on enhancing transparency by visualizing search space, query
  timers, and the impact of neuron limits on performance and quality, enabling empirical validation
  of its intelligence claims.
insights:
  - >-
    M.E.S.H. development follows a phased approach, with conversation memory (Phase 12) and strategy
    selection UI (Phase 13) as immediate priorities.
  - >-
    Transparency in M.E.S.H. operations is being enhanced through UI elements displaying search
    space coverage, query duration, and the effects of neuron limits.
  - >-
    Empirical testing of neuron limits is crucial for understanding the trade-offs between speed,
    coverage, and response quality, potentially revealing diminishing returns.
  - >-
    The impact of neuron limits on quality is critical for validating M.E.S.H.'s consciousness
    claims; a plateau suggests core patterns capture essence (Pareto Principle).
  - >-
    Conversely, if higher neuron counts consistently yield better quality, it implies a need for
    breadth and wholeness in its intelligence model.
  - >-
    Deliberately introducing false information into the search space provides an empirical method to
    test M.E.S.H.'s ability to detect falsehoods, especially within constrained searches.
  - >-
    User control over neuron search limits empowers informed choices about performance versus
    comprehensiveness, fostering trust and understanding.
