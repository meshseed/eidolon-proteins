title: 'EIDOLON-MESH: Genesis Protein, Provenance, and Testing Metaphors'
summary: >-
  The development team is creating a 'Genesis Protein' (schema file) and implementing crucial
  features like provenance tracking and a layered testing philosophy ('Organ Health' vs 'Pulse').
  Their commit strategy emphasizes preserving the causal link between 'DNA' (dialogue/code) and
  'Protein' (synthesized code) through single atomic commits, driven by biological metaphors.
insights:
  - >-
    The initial 'protein' of the code, src/types/genetics.ts, defines structure and represents the
    first functional output, analogous to a biological genesis protein.
  - >-
    Provenance tracking via 'source_dialogue_id' ensures traceability of synthesized code
    ('Proteins') back to their origin ('DNA'), demonstrating scientific rigor and forward-thinking.
  - >-
    A tiered testing approach distinguishes individual component validation ('Organ Health') from
    holistic system validation ('Pulse'), maintaining biological accuracy and deep integration.
  - >-
    The 'Single Atomic Commit' strategy, framed as a 'metabolic cycle,' preserves the causal link
    between code changes and their biological representation, driving architectural decisions.
  - >-
    Development is actively progressing on the transcriber (DNA parser) and related implementation
    phases.
  - Key collaborative elements include schema review requests and actionable requests for API keys.
