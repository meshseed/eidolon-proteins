title: 'Coherence Governance: Global Stability in Connectome Expansion'
summary: >-
  The Coherence Governance Engine ensures global stability within an expanding connectome by
  monitoring and maintaining coherence across its various structural components. It actively manages
  growth to prevent fragmentation and identity destabilization, leveraging recursive alignment
  cycles.
insights:
  - Global coherence emerges from localized alignment.
  - Expansion necessitates active governance to manage increased curvature.
  - Coherence failures manifest as fragmentation or gradient inversion.
  - Governance facilitates smooth integration of new domains.
  - Recursive alignment cycles are key to maintaining coherence.
