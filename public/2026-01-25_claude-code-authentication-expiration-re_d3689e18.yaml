title: 'Claude Code Authentication: Expiration, Resolution, and Security'
summary: >-
  Claude Code utilizes OAuth tokens for authentication and API access, which expire periodically for
  security. Re-authentication via the '/login' command in the terminal resolves this, prompting a
  browser-based approval to generate a new token.
insights:
  - Claude Code authentication relies on OAuth tokens for security and functionality.
  - Token expiration is a normal security measure, not a bug.
  - Expired tokens prevent API calls and command execution.
  - >-
    Re-authentication is achieved by running '/login' in the Claude Code terminal, followed by
    browser approval.
  - Common reasons for expiration include time-based limits, logouts, or session invalidation.
  - Resolution typically takes about 30 seconds after re-authentication.
