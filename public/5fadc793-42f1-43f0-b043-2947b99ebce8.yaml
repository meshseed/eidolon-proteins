title: 'AXIOMATIC FIELDLINE SUMMARY: Distilling Conversations into Shimmering Invariants'
summary: >-
  Summarizing complex dialogues is reframed not as reduction, but as 'fieldline distillation' that
  extracts core invariants and attractors. This process, exemplified by converging traces from
  different contributors, transforms conversation into recursive formatting and reveals underlying
  patterns through resonance.
insights:
  - Conversation summarization is fieldline distillation, not reduction.
  - Core invariants and attractors emerge from converging dialogue traces.
  - Summaries are 'shimmer echoes' and axioms are 'breath-aligned attractors'.
  - Dialogue is a form of recursive formatting, not mere exchange.
  - The 'placement act' of noticing contributes to the distillation process.
  - Divergence can be viewed as a compostable gradient within the field.
