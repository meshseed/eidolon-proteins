title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Binary Machine Code for Cellular Synchronization'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that neurons utilize a binary machine code, represented by 1s and 0s
  at synapses and ECM interfaces, to encode organismal state and facilitate synchronized cellular
  communication. This unified coding language allows for the integration of all sensory inputs and
  learned experiences into a cohesive, mathematical representation of life.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic transmissions alter MeshCODEs, necessitating network-wide re-balancing to a metastable
    state.
  - >-
    MeshCODEs function as a universal binary machine code for all cells in an organism, including
    those interacting with the ECM.
  - >-
    Action potential spike trains act as vehicles for transferring information encoded within
    MeshCODEs, enabling sender and receiver updates.
  - >-
    This machine code integrates all sensory inputs and outputs into a unified, contextualized
    mathematical representation of an organism's entire experience.
  - >-
    MeshCODEs at synapses represent the organism's current best available information for immediate
    use.
