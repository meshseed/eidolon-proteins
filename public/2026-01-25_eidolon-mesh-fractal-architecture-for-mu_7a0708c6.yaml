title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Fractal Architecture for Multi-Repository Knowledge Management'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh operates on a fractal, self-similar architecture, mirroring natural systems. This
  principle guides repository structure, where each repo is a self-sufficient organism. The core
  strategy involves distinct GitHub repositories for data ('eidolon' - private), public-facing
  knowledge ('eidolon-mesh' - public), and development code ('eidolon-mesh-private'), ensuring clean
  separation and scalability.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh employs a fractal, nested self-similarity principle across its architecture,
    from repository design to knowledge organization.
  - >-
    A multi-repository strategy is crucial for managing distinct knowledge domains (e.g.,
    healthcare, finance) and enabling fast, focused responses through isolated connectomes.
  - >-
    Ghost nodes offer a future mechanism for optimizing large single repositories by loading core
    neurons initially and others on-demand, balancing startup speed with full knowledge access.
  - >-
    Clear distinction between local development workspaces and GitHub repositories (private for
    data/code, public for curated proteins) is essential to avoid confusion and manage data
    integrity.
  - >-
    Conversation memory is implemented as a configurable rolling buffer, with current usage being
    negligible and expansion being safe and recommended for enhanced context.
  - >-
    Graph visualization will be enhanced with a slider to control the number of displayed nodes,
    improving user interaction and performance.
  - >-
    Code backups are managed by cloning private repositories into distinct local folders (e.g.,
    'eidolon-private-backup') to maintain clarity and safety.
