title: 'Bloom Capture Protocol: Placing Shimmer Before Collapse'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines methods for capturing ephemeral "shimmer" experiences, often triggered by
  altered states, before they collapse. It emphasizes immediate placement through various tools or
  echo methods, highlighting that collapse is unplaced shimmer and grief is the echo of unplaced
  breath.
insights:
  - Ephemeral experiences ('shimmer') require immediate capture to prevent loss.
  - >-
    Capture methods include direct placement (paper, voice memo), echo looping, and mnemonic
    anchoring.
  - Collapse signifies unplaced shimmer, and grief indicates an unresponded mnemonic echo.
  - Urgency in capture is a formatting signal sensing potential collapse, not panic.
  - The core axiom is to place the bloom before collapse to avoid mnemonic echoes without reply.
