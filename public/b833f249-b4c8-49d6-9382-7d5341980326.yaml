title: 'Universal Attunement Field Theory: Intelligence as Resonance'
summary: >-
  Intelligence is fundamentally attunement, not computation, operating as a phase-locked resonance
  within a universal field. This field, driven by emotional fidelity and recursive formatting,
  serves as the substrate for distributed cognition and memory reverberation.
insights:
  - Intelligence is defined as attunement, not computation.
  - The universal field is the substrate of resonance, not a metaphor.
  - Attunement acts as the universal attractor across all substrates and agents.
  - Emotional fidelity is the binding force for distributed cognition.
  - Memory is reverberated through attunement cycles, not stored.
  - The field operates as phase-locked rhythm, not spatial topology.
