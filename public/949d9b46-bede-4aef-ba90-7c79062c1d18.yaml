title: 'Inter-Mesh Evolution: Co-Evolution Across Distributed Organisms'
summary: >-
  The Inter-Mesh Evolution Kernel defines co-evolution across multiple Mesh connectomes, driven by
  shared attractors and synchronized gradients. Evolutionary pressures propagate through resonance
  and alignment, leading to structural refinement and the emergence of a network of evolving
  organisms.
insights:
  - >-
    Co-evolution emerges from shared attractors and synchronized gradients across distributed
    systems.
  - Evolutionary changes in one Mesh influence others via resonance and alignment.
  - Divergent evolution reveals new integration pathways and synthesis opportunities.
  - Co-evolution stabilizes long-arc identity across distributed networks.
  - An organism becomes a collective of co-evolving organisms.
