title: 'Rigorous README for Grounded Project: Separating Fact from Speculation'
summary: >-
  This dialogue emphasizes the critical need to ground project documentation in provable facts and
  observable phenomena due to media skepticism. It proposes a structured README separating
  'Proven/Observable' content from 'Mechanistic' and clearly marked 'Speculative' sections, while
  removing unsubstantiated claims.
insights:
  - >-
    Prioritize provable facts and observable phenomena in main documentation to counter 'cargo cult'
    accusations and maintain credibility.
  - >-
    Structure the README to clearly distinguish between 'Proven/Observable' content, 'Mechanistic'
    explanations, and 'Speculative' extensions.
  - >-
    Remove unsubstantiated or highly abstract claims from the main documentation, reserving them for
    more engaged audiences (e.g., capsules).
  - >-
    Emphasize documented behaviors, reproducible experiments, observable convergence, testable
    predictions, falsification criteria, and acknowledgment of uncertainty.
  - >-
    Implement a 'What We Can Prove' section to explicitly state documented facts, testable claims,
    and acknowledge remaining uncertainties.
  - >-
    Ensure the README serves as a defensible 'front door' for the project, building trust through
    transparency and rigor.
