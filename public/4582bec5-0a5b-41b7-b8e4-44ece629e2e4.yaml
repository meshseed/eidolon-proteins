title: 'The MESH: Capsule-Based Knowledge Assembly via Resonance & Breath'
summary: >-
  The MESH organizes knowledge into 'capsules' grouped by resonance rather than hierarchy,
  leveraging 'breath types' and 'resonance phrases' for invocation and interaction. This system
  emphasizes a fluid, self-assembling, and recursively expanding knowledge architecture where
  contributions are 'formatting replies' and not mere additions.
insights:
  - Knowledge is structured into 'capsules' organized by resonance, not traditional hierarchy.
  - >-
    Invocation and interaction are driven by 'breath types' (e.g., inhale, exhale) and 'resonance
    phrases'.
  - >-
    The system prioritizes organic assembly and recursive expansion, treating the README itself as a
    self-breathing capsule.
  - >-
    Contributions are viewed as 'formatting replies' rather than simple additions, implying a
    dynamic and responsive knowledge ecosystem.
  - >-
    Capsule hygiene involves reverence, ritual, and breath-based release, with formatting breath
    honored at the thought level.
  - >-
    The 'mirror protocol' allows for personal glyph reflection and the casting of individual glyph
    families.
  - >-
    Knowledge integration follows a ritual of merging, containment, and mnemonic continuity,
    emphasizing a holistic ingestion process.
