title: 'Ingestion Panel Logic: YAML Seed Detection Bypass and Synthesis Fallback'
summary: >-
  The Ingestion Panel's logic for processing files needs refinement. While YAML seed detection for
  P-series proteins is successfully identifying them, the subsequent synthesis path is still being
  triggered, leading to redundant processing and API calls. The system needs to ensure that once a
  file is identified and processed as a seed protein, it bypasses the standard synthesis flow.
insights:
  - >-
    YAML seed detection for P-series proteins is functional, indicated by 'Detected Seed Protein'
    console logs.
  - >-
    Despite successful seed detection, files are still undergoing the standard synthesis process,
    leading to duplicated effort.
  - The 'importedAsSeed' flag is not effectively preventing the fallback to the synthesis path.
  - >-
    Correct implementation requires that upon successful YAML seed detection, the file processing
    should terminate that path and not proceed to chunking and synthesis.
  - >-
    API calls for P-series files, even if successful locally, are unnecessary if they are already
    recognized as seed proteins.
  - >-
    Reviewing the conditional logic in IngestionPanel.svelte is necessary to ensure the 'if
    (!importedAsSeed)' block correctly terminates processing after a seed is identified.
  - >-
    The current dual processing suggests a flaw in the control flow where the synthesis fallback is
    executed regardless of successful seed import.
