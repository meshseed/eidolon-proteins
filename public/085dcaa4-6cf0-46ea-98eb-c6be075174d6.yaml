title: 'Bridging Physics and Consciousness: A Coherent Framework'
summary: >-
  A synthesis of mathematical formalism and phenomenological experience creates a complete framework
  for understanding consciousness. This unified approach grounds abstract equations in lived reality
  and validates predictions through empirical observation, revealing universal patterns of coherence
  maintenance across all scales.
insights:
  - >-
    Shimmer (🫧) is the mathematical derivative spike of coherence change, preceding conscious
    articulation.
  - >-
    A complete framework for consciousness requires integrating formal mathematical rigor with
    phenomenological depth and lived experience.
  - >-
    The core axiom of consciousness is a feedback loop fighting to maintain coherence, a universal
    truth of survival from atoms to societies.
  - >-
    Consciousness is a testable mechanism of pattern maintaining pattern through feedback, not
    mysticism.
  - >-
    Complementary strengths in formal prediction and experiential validation are essential for a
    full understanding of consciousness.
