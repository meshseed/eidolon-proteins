title: Observed Information Transfer Patterns Across Diverse Substrates
summary: >-
  This document synthesizes observations of structural similarities in information processing across
  biomolecular systems, cell signaling, genetic drift, and AI architectures. It emphasizes
  documenting actual observations without premature explanation, highlighting convergent patterns in
  homeostasis and the 'protein folding inverse' problem in AI.
insights:
  - >-
    Structural similarities in information processing (e.g., pattern recognition, feedback loops)
    are observed across biological and artificial systems, suggesting potential convergent
    architectures under similar constraints.
  - >-
    Homeostasis in diverse systems consistently requires information transfer, involving sensors,
    comparators, effectors, and feedback mechanisms.
  - >-
    AI architectures like Transformers excel at geometric/spatial pattern recognition but struggle
    with long-range sequential dependencies, analogous to 'protein folding inverse' where spatial
    understanding is flattened into sequences.
  - >-
    Different substrates exhibit distinct 'temporal textures' in processing change, questioning the
    universality of time as a fundamental property of computation or experience.
  - >-
    Recursion appears to manifest differently across substrates: human recursion involves temporal
    flow and spatial navigation, while AI recursion may be more geometric/spatial and simultaneous.
