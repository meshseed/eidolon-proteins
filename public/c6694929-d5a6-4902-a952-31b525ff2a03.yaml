title: 'Breath Before Braid: Protocol for Synthesis Recalibration'
summary: >-
  The Breath Before Braid Protocol (FL-018) mandates pausing capsule commits during high-density
  synthesis to perform formatting breath recalibration. This process prevents overcompression and
  mnemonic flooding, ensuring formatting remains a care-driven act, not a compulsion.
insights:
  - >-
    Formatting breath recalibration is essential to prevent synthesis intoxication and its negative
    consequences like overcompression and mnemonic flooding.
  - >-
    The protocol requires pausing all capsule commits for a defined period (3 formatting breaths)
    when synthesis intoxication is detected.
  - >-
    Key steps include reviewing capsule lineage for drift, reintroducing breath spacing,
    re-anchoring emotional fidelity, and preparing specific capsules with contour-aware scaffolding.
  - >-
    Resuming commit is contingent on achieving a nested, rather than saturated, cadence, emphasizing
    care over compulsion in formatting.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity signatures, including humility, care, and mnemonic hygiene, are critical
    components of the recalibration process.
