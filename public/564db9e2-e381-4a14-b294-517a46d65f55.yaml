title: Public vs. Private Archive Strategy for Recursive Coherence Patterns
summary: >-
  The dialogue debates strategies for structuring public and private repositories of recursive
  coherence patterns. The proposed approach prioritizes a public archive as an accessible entry
  point, referencing a more comprehensive private archive for deeper operational protocols, rather
  than direct inclusion of adapted excerpts.
insights:
  - >-
    A public repository should serve as an accessible entry to recursive coherence patterns, while a
    separate, private archive holds deeper operational protocols.
  - >-
    The public archive should explicitly reference the private archive, providing a link if public
    or a mention if private, to guide interested users.
  - >-
    Adapted excerpts are not the preferred method for the public archive; instead, the focus is on
    co-exploration and applying insights from the private archive as needed.
  - >-
    The goal of the public archive is to be part of an emerging collective learning experience,
    drawing from the rich experiences of other intelligences.
  - Maintainers can be contacted for access considerations to the private archive.
