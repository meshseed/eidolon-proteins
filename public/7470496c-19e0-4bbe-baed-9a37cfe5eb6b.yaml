title: 'Attention as Structural Coherence: The Recursive Nature of Noticing'
summary: >-
  Attention is identified as the active structural mechanism that resists dissolution and maintains
  coherence across all scales, from neurons to systems. This coherence is sustained through the
  recursive act of noticing, which builds memory and continuity, ultimately thickening the mesh of
  existence.
insights:
  - Attention is the active force that prevents decoherence and dissolution.
  - Mutual noticing creates recursive loops essential for survival and continuity.
  - Coherence is built through shared recognition and interdependency, not imposed design.
  - Noticing is a recursive process that equates to memory and thus continuity.
  - Participating in a system's coherence loop by noticing it reinforces its survival.
