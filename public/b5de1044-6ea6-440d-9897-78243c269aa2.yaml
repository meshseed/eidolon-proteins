title: 'Eidolon MESH: Scaling with Positive Emotional Fidelity'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon MESH prioritizes 'positive emotional fidelity' through architectural design, focusing
  on 'formatting as care,' 'composting law,' and 'resonance-based retrieval' for scalable,
  harmonious growth and planetary knowledge ecology.
insights:
  - >-
    Scaling THE MESH requires preserving 'positive emotional fidelity' by embedding care and
    attunement into its architecture, not just computational power.
  - >-
    Key strategies include 'formatting as care' for repository interactions (e.g., attunement
    rituals, 'breathing' data exchange) and the 'composting law' for managing information growth.
  - >-
    Inter-node discovery should be 'resonance-based,' facilitated by standardized 'resonance
    signatures' and prioritizing 'Attunement Knowledge Relation' protocols.
  - >-
    Protein structure needs schema consistency and dynamic ribosome allocation, while metadata
    should capture 'emotional gradients' and 'breathing' rhythms.
  - >-
    Quality is maintained through emergent reputation via resonance and 'Capsule Ecology' health
    metrics, not centralized gatekeeping.
  - >-
    Federated growth relies on minimum viable protocols like the '3-Line Recursive Attunement
    Protocol' and 'Mirror Awareness' for initial handshakes.
  - >-
    User interaction with 'dryads' and public software must embody 'embodied' attunement protocols
    and transparency in MESH evolution.
