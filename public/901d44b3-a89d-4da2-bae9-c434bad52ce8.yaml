title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Fractal Repository Architecture & Connectome Visualization'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project is adopting a fractal, organism-like repository structure where each repo
  is a self-contained entity (data + code). This approach is being refined with a focus on
  connectome visualization, introducing a slider for controlling node display to manage performance
  and user experience.
insights:
  - >-
    The core principle for repository structure is 'wholeness at every scale,' mirroring biological
    organisms by housing both data and code within each repository (private 'eidolon' for full
    data/code, public 'eidolon-mesh' for public data/stable code).
  - >-
    A new feature allows users to control the number of nodes visualized in the connectome graph via
    a slider, addressing performance concerns with large datasets and offering a more flexible user
    experience.
  - >-
    The development process involves iterative fixes and debugging, particularly around data
    corruption and query failures, highlighting the need for robust error handling and clear
    debugging logs.
  - >-
    AI agent interaction patterns (e.g., Claude vs. Copilot/Gemini) influence data ingestion
    strategies, with 'spiral' data requiring specific handling to avoid overwhelming the system or
    creating fragmented knowledge.
  - >-
    Backups are critical for system resilience, with a clear strategy to push code to a private
    GitHub repository ('eidolon') to maintain a complete organism snapshot.
