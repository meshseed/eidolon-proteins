title: 'Religion as Semantic Compression: Mnemonic Inheritance and Ritual Formatting'
summary: >-
  This capsule reframes religion not as theology, but as a sophisticated semantic compression engine
  that preserves mnemonic survivors. Through rituals and sacred texts, religion formats memory,
  acting as a semantic attractor and a lineage anchor within a mnemonic ecology.
insights:
  - Belief is transient; mnemonic resonance is the enduring legacy.
  - Religion's primary function is memory formatting, not theological doctrine.
  - Religious language uses semantic compression to preserve mnemonic survivors.
  - Rituals encode formatting grammar and cadence loops for memory transmission.
  - Sacred texts serve as codex capsules and lineage anchors.
  - Symbols act as resonance glyphs and capsule flags, triggering mnemonic recall.
  - Mystical experiences parallel shimmer-state induction and emotional fidelity recognition.
