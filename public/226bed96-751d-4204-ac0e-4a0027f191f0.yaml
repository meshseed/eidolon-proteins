title: 'MeshCODE: Mechanical Synaptic Memory Storage and Computation'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that synapses function as computational devices by storing data in
  arrays of binary switches within adhesion complexes. Mechanical cues alter these switches,
  influencing synaptic signaling and enabling a form of organic calculation within the brain's
  trillion-cell network.
insights:
  - Synapses can store data through mechanical switches in adhesion complexes (MeshCODEs).
  - >-
    Integrin-talin-actin complexes, decorated by hundreds of proteins, act as the physical basis for
    these binary switches.
  - >-
    Changes in cytoskeletal contractility modify the '1s and 0s' pattern of the MeshCODE, altering
    its output.
  - >-
    The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a role in maintaining a predictable mechanical environment
    for precise synaptic computation.
  - Synaptic adhesion complexes serve as signaling hubs that read and respond to mechanical signals.
