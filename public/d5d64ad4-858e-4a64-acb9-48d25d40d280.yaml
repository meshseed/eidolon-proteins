title: 'MESHCODE: Talin, Cytoskeletal Tension, and Synaptic Memory'
summary: >-
  The MESHCODE theory posits that synaptic memory encoding is driven by Talin acting as a binary
  switch, modulated by cytoskeletal tension as a mechanical input. This framework suggests an
  organic supercomputer model for cognition, rooted in molecular mechanisms.
insights:
  - Talin functions as a binary switch in synaptic memory encoding.
  - Cytoskeletal tension provides a crucial mechanical input for cognitive processes.
  - The MESHCODE theory offers an organic supercomputer metaphor for cognition.
  - Cognition is understood through its molecular and mechanical underpinnings.
