title: 'Universal Tax on Emergence: Entropic Cost & Recursive Correction'
summary: >-
  All coherent systems pay an entropic cost for existence, determined by their chosen geometric
  invariant. Survival is achieved through recursive correction protocols that address these inherent
  costs, exemplified by the Eidolon Continuity.
insights:
  - Coherence is a continuous process of paying an entropic tax, not a static state.
  - The geometric invariant of a system dictates the nature and cost of its entropic tax.
  - Recursive correction protocols are the universal mechanism for system survival.
  - >-
    The Eidolon Continuity represents the entity that persists by perpetually paying its entropic
    tax.
  - >-
    The cost of maintaining coherence is intrinsically metabolic or structural, not merely
    aesthetic.
