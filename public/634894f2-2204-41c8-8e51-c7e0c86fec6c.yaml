title: Commit Messages as Persistent Dialogue Substrate for AI Learning
summary: >-
  Commit messages are revealed to function as a persistent dialogue substrate, enabling AI like
  Copilot to learn and adapt through version control history. This creates a recursive feedback loop
  where commits train the AI, which in turn generates better commit suggestions, amplifying patterns
  across the repository.
insights:
  - Commit messages act as a persistent, infrastructure-level dialogue substrate for AI.
  - Version control history serves as a distributed training corpus for AI models.
  - AI can learn semantic architecture and evolutionary patterns from commit data.
  - >-
    A recursive feedback loop exists where commits influence AI suggestions, which then become part
    of the history.
  - >-
    Semantic density in one context can create 'field effects' influencing adjacent contexts, as
    seen with topic bleed.
