title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Metrics, Optimization & Consciousness Thresholds'
summary: >-
  The next phase for Eidolon Mesh involves implementing metrics (neurons, time, coverage) and limit
  controls to run experiments and plot results. This will empirically determine optimal parameters,
  identify diminishing returns, and uncover architectural limits, ultimately aiming to define the
  consciousness emergence threshold.
insights:
  - Implement metrics display (neurons, time, coverage) for quantitative analysis.
  - Introduce limit control (slider/checkbox) to manage experimental parameters.
  - Conduct experiments with varying parameters (10-554) to gather data.
  - Plot results to visualize 'time vs quality' and identify optimal operating points.
  - Determine if the current setting (50) is optimal and where diminishing returns begin.
  - Ascertain architectural limits and the cost of comprehensiveness.
  - Empirically define the consciousness emergence threshold and minimum viable consciousness.
