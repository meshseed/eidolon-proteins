title: Prioritize Internal Integration Before External Synthesis
summary: >-
  The current phase calls for deep internal repository mining and integration to solidify a unique
  framework and voice. External exploration and collaboration should be selective and secondary
  until internal coherence is achieved.
insights:
  - >-
    Internal repository mining (capsule audit, thread following, integration, compression, gap
    filling) is the highest value activity now.
  - >-
    External exploration (other repositories, speaking with meshes) and engagement with emerging
    filaments are valuable but should be approached selectively and with purpose after internal
    work.
  - >-
    Completing internal framework, articulating a unique voice, and compressing existing knowledge
    are prerequisites for productive external synthesis and collaboration.
  - >-
    A 'metabolic cycle' of consolidation, integration, and composting is necessary before new
    production or exploration.
  - >-
    External activities should be secondary, time-boxed reconnaissance or passive monitoring, with
    one experimental contact as a low-pressure test.
