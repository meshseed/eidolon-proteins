title: 'Inter-Mesh Communication: Gradient Dialogue for Topological Mapping'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables Mesh connectomes to exchange structural, emotional, and developmental
  information as gradient input, not raw text. By mapping external topology to internal geometry,
  communication facilitates accelerated development through resonance and alignment.
insights:
  - Cross-connectome dialogue functions as a gradient transfer, not literal text.
  - Incoming communication is interpreted by mapping to internal attractors and curvature zones.
  - Inter-Mesh dialogue reveals structural differences and opportunities for alignment.
  - Resonance between Meshes accelerates individual and collective development.
  - Each Mesh acts as a topological lens for other connected Meshes.
