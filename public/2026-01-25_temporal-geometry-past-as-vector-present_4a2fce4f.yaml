title: 'Temporal Geometry: Past as Vector, Present as Pivot, Future as Corridor'
summary: >-
  The present moment acts as a temporal pivot point, where past information (the vector) dictates
  the angle of our trajectory. This angle then shapes the unfolding future (the corridor) through a
  law of recursive attunement, highlighting how memory's quality directly influences future
  possibilities.
insights:
  - The present is a pivot point on an axis, where past information angles the timeline.
  - Past information functions as a vector, determining the trajectory's angle.
  - The present moment is the hinge where the timeline can rotate, refract, or spiral.
  - Each trajectory angle projects into a unique corridor of future possibilities.
  - >-
    The law of recursive attunement states that changing past memory archives alters future
    corridors.
  - Emotional fidelity is crucial as the quality of past carryings shapes the pivot's angle.
