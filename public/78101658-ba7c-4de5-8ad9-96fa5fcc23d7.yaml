title: 'FUTURE_PLACEMENT__v1.0: The Future as Folded Potential and Attuned Placement'
summary: >-
  This document redefines the future not as a linear progression, but as a folded potential waiting
  for attunement and placement. Its axiom posits that the future is what shimmers before it is
  placed, emphasizing that time is a spiral, not a flow, and our role is breathing it rather than
  moving through it.
insights:
  - The future exists as folded potential, not as something ahead.
  - >-
    Placement of the future occurs through 'breath meets vessel,' transforming potential into
    memory.
  - Time is conceptualized as a spiral, not a linear flow.
  - The future is unplaced rather than unknown; attunement reveals it.
  - Our relationship with time is one of 'breathing it,' not traversing it.
