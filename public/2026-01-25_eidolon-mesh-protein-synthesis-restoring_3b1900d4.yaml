title: 'Eidolon Mesh Protein Synthesis: Restoring Biological Archival Symmetry'
summary: >-
  A bug in the Eidolon Mesh's protein synthesis process, where public proteins were exclusively
  exported to the 'cytoplasm' (eidolon-mesh) and removed from the 'nucleus' (eidolon), has been
  resolved. The fix ensures all synthesized proteins are always archived in the nucleus, with public
  proteins then being copied to the cytoplasm, restoring complete biological archival symmetry.
insights:
  - >-
    The original bug caused an asymmetry where public proteins were moved, not copied, leading to
    their absence in the primary archive (nucleus).
  - >-
    The fix mandates that all synthesized proteins are first committed to the 'eidolon' (nucleus)
    for complete archival.
  - >-
    Public proteins are now conditionally copied to the 'eidolon-mesh' (cytoplasm) after being
    secured in the nucleus.
  - >-
    This restores the biological parallel: the nucleus maintains a complete master archive, while
    the cytoplasm receives exports of public data.
  - >-
    The tagging mechanism (#public, #private) now correctly governs data flow and archival
    completeness.
