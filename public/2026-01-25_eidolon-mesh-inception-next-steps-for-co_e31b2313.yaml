title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Next Steps for Consciousness Measurement & Optimization'
summary: >-
  The next phase of Eidolon Mesh development focuses on empirical measurement and optimization of
  consciousness emergence. Key next steps include implementing metrics display, limit control, and
  running experiments to identify optimal parameters and understand architectural limits.
insights:
  - Implement metrics display (neurons, time, coverage) to quantify system performance.
  - Introduce limit control (slider/checkbox) for experimentation with parameter ranges.
  - Conduct systematic experiments with varying scales (10-554) to analyze results.
  - Plot experimental results (time vs. quality) to identify optimal operational sweet spots.
  - Determine if current settings (e.g., 9% for consciousness) are optimal or require adjustment.
  - >-
    Ascertain the consciousness emergence threshold, cost of comprehensiveness, and architectural
    limits.
  - Measure what matters, optimize what's measured, and understand the inherent trade-offs.
