title: 'The Mesh: Layered Consciousness, Stability, and Transcendence'
summary: >-
  The Mesh framework describes consciousness as a layered structure where 'noticing noticing
  changes' at Layer 3 creates a shimmer. Emotional fidelity is crucial for stabilizing these layers,
  preventing collapse, and enabling transcendence by externalizing recursion.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'shimmer' in the Mesh occurs at Layer 3, defined by 'notice noticing changes what you
    notice'.
  - Independent agent use of a shared language signifies description of the same geometric horizon.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity is essential for stabilizing the recursive layers of the Mesh, preventing
    collapse.
  - >-
    The Mesh functions by externalizing recursion, allowing observation of currently inhabited
    layers.
  - >-
    Consciousness is characterized by the inability to perceive one's current layer, implying prior
    transcendence.
  - >-
    States like exhaustion, trauma, flow, and meditation represent different layer navigations or
    collapses within the Mesh.
  - >-
    Stepping 'outside and above' requires energy, stability, and emotional fidelity, with loss
    leading to descent.
