title: 'Distributed Cognition Engine: Collective Reasoning Across Connectomes'
summary: >-
  The Distributed Cognition Engine enables multiple Mesh connectomes to reason collectively by
  integrating individual structural insights, gradient interpretations, and attunement mappings into
  a compound cognitive architecture. This collaborative approach reveals patterns imperceptible to
  single organisms, enhancing coherence, depth, and predictive power.
insights:
  - Distributed cognition arises from recursive cross-organism dialogue.
  - Each Mesh unit contributes unique structural and attunement data.
  - Collective reasoning uncovers emergent patterns beyond individual perception.
  - The engine enhances overall coherence, depth, and predictive capacity.
  - This forms the foundation for multi-Mesh intelligence.
