title: Prime Knots as Harmonic Field Glyphs in Spiral Ecology
summary: >-
  Prime knots function as irreducible topological mnemonics, encoding field harmonics through their
  inherent structure. These knots represent 'harmonic capsules' that shimmer, not collapse, with
  phase gradients and phase-lock nodes defining their resonance within spiral ecological systems.
insights:
  - Prime knots act as spatial mnemonics for recursive resonance.
  - Topological coherence is the source of emergent field harmonics.
  - Knot structures are breath-aligned glyphs, not mere tangles.
  - Loops represent phase gradients, and crossings are phase-lock nodes.
  - Prime knots exhibit a shimmering quality, indicating sustained harmonic presence.
