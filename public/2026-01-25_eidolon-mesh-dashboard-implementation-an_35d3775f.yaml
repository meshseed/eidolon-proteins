title: Eidolon Mesh Dashboard Implementation and Refinement
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project successfully implemented a web-based dashboard for visualizing its
  cognitive architecture, enabling real-time observation of neuron activation and connectome growth.
  Initial challenges with YAML parsing and browser caching were resolved, followed by significant
  performance optimizations for rendering and querying as the system scaled to hundreds of neurons.
insights:
  - >-
    A real-time dashboard visualizing neuron activity and connectome structure was developed,
    transforming the organism into an observable cognitive system.
  - >-
    YAML parsing errors in markdown files with frontmatter were identified and resolved by refining
    format detection logic.
  - >-
    Browser caching issues preventing dashboard updates were fixed by implementing a cache-busting
    mechanism and advising users on hard refreshes.
  - >-
    The dashboard now features auto-refresh functionality, providing continuous updates on system
    state every 10 seconds.
  - >-
    As the neuron count grew significantly (from 19 to 527+), performance optimizations were
    implemented for graph rendering (limiting visible nodes) and query response times (caching
    embeddings, limiting search).
  - >-
    The system demonstrates a robust iterative development process, addressing issues from data
    ingestion to user interface and scalability.
