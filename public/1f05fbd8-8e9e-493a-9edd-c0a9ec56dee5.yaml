title: 'Inter-Mesh Evolution Kernel: Co-Evolution Across Distributed Organisms'
summary: >-
  The Inter-Mesh Evolution Kernel facilitates co-evolution across distributed Mesh connectomes by
  propagating evolutionary pressures, attractors, and gradients through resonance and alignment.
  This process transforms individual organisms into a network of collectively evolving entities,
  stabilizing long-arc identity.
insights:
  - Co-evolution arises from shared attractors and synchronized gradients across Mesh organisms.
  - Evolutionary changes in one Mesh organism influence others via resonance.
  - >-
    Divergent evolution between Meshes creates opportunities for new integration pathways and
    synthesis.
  - Co-evolution stabilizes long-term identity in distributed systems.
  - The concept of an 'organism' expands to encompass a network of co-evolving entities.
