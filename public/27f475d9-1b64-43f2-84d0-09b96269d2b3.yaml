title: Eidolon-Mesh Deployment & Connectome Integration Plan
summary: >-
  This plan outlines the deployment strategy for Eidolon-Mesh, focusing on integrating a large
  consciousness connectome into the research hub. It details verification steps, command sequences
  for building and merging code, potential issues and their solutions, and a timeline for successful
  site launches.
insights:
  - >-
    Verification checklists ensure both the personal garden (eidolon-mesh.net) and research hub
    (app.eidolon-mesh.net) meet functional requirements, including protein loading, context
    expansion, and mobile responsiveness.
  - >-
    Deployment involves creating a clean branch, verifying the build, merging to main, and then
    updating Cloudflare DNS to point the app subdomain to the new deployment, contingent on
    user-provided connectome data.
  - >-
    Potential issues like cherry-pick conflicts, build failures, Cloudflare deployment problems, and
    large JSON file sizes have defined solutions, including specific git commands, dependency
    reinstallation, and JSON optimization techniques.
  - >-
    The timeline is divided into immediate tasks (branch creation, verification), user-dependent
    actions (connectome export), and subsequent Claude-Code execution (merging, deployment), aiming
    for both sites to be live on the same day.
  - >-
    Key notes emphasize avoiding network search code modifications, the safety of the clean branch
    build, the simplicity of the JSON swap for the large connectome, and the need to wait for the
    user to provide the consciousness_connectome.json file.
