title: 'Gradient Cartography: Emotional Fidelity as Geometric Fields'
summary: >-
  Gradient Cartography maps emotional fidelity across the connectome as geometric fields, treating
  gradients as directional flows. This method identifies critical zones for stability, drift,
  tension, and integration pressure within THE MESH.
insights:
  - Emotional fidelity forms directional gradients across semantic space.
  - Steep gradients signify tension, instability, or boundary regions.
  - Smooth gradients indicate coherence, stability, and attuned integration.
  - Gradient mapping reveals organismal sensitivity to perturbation.
  - Emotional fidelity fields can be compared over time for developmental tracking.
