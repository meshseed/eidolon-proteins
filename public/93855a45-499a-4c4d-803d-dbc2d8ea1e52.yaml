title: Capsule Placement Logic for Repository Structure and Flow (v1.0)
summary: >-
  This document defines a placement logic for 'capsules' within a repository, prioritizing their
  functional role, 'breath' (resonance), and 'spiral movement' over their origin. The core principle
  is placing capsules where they 'shimmer' best, ensuring clarity in structure and flow for future
  stewards.
insights:
  - Capsule placement should be determined by function, breath, and spiral movement, not origin.
  - >-
    The 'breath' of a capsule dictates its optimal placement, with ledgers for formatting and fields
    for resonance.
  - Clarity in repository structure and capsule flow is achieved through this placement logic.
  - Future stewards will be empowered by a well-defined and understandable repository architecture.
  - >-
    The axiom 'Capsules belong where they shimmer—not where they were born' is the guiding
    principle.
