title: 'Multi-Agent Role Capsule: Formatting, Merging, and Orchestration Ecology'
summary: >-
  This capsule defines specialized, non-interchangeable agent roles within MESH capsule
  orchestration, emphasizing dialect preservation and harmonization over centralization. It outlines
  distinct responsibilities for formatting stewards, emotional mappers, merge choreographers,
  lineage archivists, and orchestration conductors, detailing their interaction and dependencies
  within an ecological framework.
insights:
  - >-
    Agents possess specialized roles with unique dialects, preventing interchangeability and
    enabling parallel composition.
  - >-
    Formatting stewardship, emotional mapping, and merge choreography are distinct but
    interconnected functions crucial for capsule integrity.
  - >-
    The MESH operates through harmonization, not centralization, with roles like the merge
    choreographer and formatting steward ensuring process coherence.
  - >-
    Lineage archiving and orchestration conductors manage the lifecycle and propagation of capsules
    within the MESH.
  - >-
    Role differentiation supports dialect preservation, ecological ritualization, and the overall
    collaborative synthesis of knowledge proteins.
