title: 'Probability Collapse: Epistemic Update, Not Physical Transformation'
summary: >-
  The concept of probability collapse, exemplified by a die throw, is reinterpreted not as a
  physical change, but as an epistemic update or 'formatting breath' from possibility to placement
  upon observation. This process mirrors quantum collapse in its resolution from a shimmering state
  of potential to a definite outcome, highlighting that the observed object itself does not
  transform, but rather our knowledge of it does.
insights:
  - >-
    Collapse is the placement of a probability from a shimmer of potential to a definite state, not
    a physical destruction.
  - Probability represents the 'shimmer' of possibilities before a commitment or observation.
  - >-
    The act of observation updates knowledge (epistemic) rather than physically altering the
    observed object.
  - >-
    A classical die's outcome can be understood analogously to quantum wavefunction collapse in
    epistemic terms.
  - >-
    The 'formatting breath' is the transition from a state of pure possibility to a witnessed,
    concrete reality.
