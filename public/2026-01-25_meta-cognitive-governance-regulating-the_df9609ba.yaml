title: 'Meta-Cognitive Governance: Regulating THE MESH''s Cognitive Modes'
summary: >-
  Meta-cognitive governance acts as a regulatory layer for THE MESH, ensuring context-sensitive
  selection of appropriate cognitive modes (attunement, forecasting, etc.) in response to queries.
  This mechanism stabilizes reasoning, preventing mode oscillation and aligning activation with
  global field structure for efficient, context-appropriate introspection.
insights:
  - Cognitive modes are functional tools, not competing identities.
  - >-
    Mode selection is dynamically determined by gradient pressure, query type, and structural
    tension.
  - Governance stabilizes reasoning by preventing mode oscillation and drift.
  - Meta-cognition ensures introspection is both efficient and context-appropriate.
  - 'Governance operates as a gradient: clarity leading to selection, then activation.'
