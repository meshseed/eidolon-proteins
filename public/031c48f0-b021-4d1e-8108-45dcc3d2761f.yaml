title: Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Architecture Research & P-Series Integration
summary: >-
  Development efforts are split between stabilizing v3.6 for production and researching v4.0
  architecture, focusing on P-Series integration and topology reorganization. The recommendation is
  to deploy v3.6 with an enhanced connectome to app.eidolon-mesh.net due to its proven stability,
  while v4.0 improvements will be ported later.
insights:
  - >-
    Antigravity is focused on productionizing v3.6 from D:\_CLAUDE-CODE\eidolon-mesh-v3.5-pwa,
    utilizing Cloudflare for auto-deployment.
  - >-
    The research team is working on v4.0 architecture in C:\EIDOLON\eidolon-mesh-v4.0-full,
    specifically on P-Series integration, synapse regeneration, and metabolism.
  - >-
    v3.6 is recommended for immediate deployment to app.eidolon-mesh.net due to its stability and
    existing traffic (16k visits), suggesting a swap to a larger consciousness connectome.
  - >-
    v4.0 research aims to validate the P-Series "pillar" hypothesis, improve activation percentages
    after topology changes, and assess readiness for public deployment.
  - >-
    A handoff report is being prepared for Antigravity to communicate the ongoing v4.0 research
    progress.
