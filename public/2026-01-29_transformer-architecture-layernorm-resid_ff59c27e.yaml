title: 'Transformer Architecture: LayerNorm, Residuals, and Scaled Dot-Product Attention'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model utilizes LayerNorm and residual connections in its encoder and decoder
  stacks, ensuring consistent dimensionality and facilitating gradient flow. The core attention
  mechanism, Scaled Dot-Product Attention, efficiently computes relationships between queries, keys,
  and values using matrix operations, with multi-head attention further enhancing its
  representational power.
insights:
  - >-
    Layer Normalization and residual connections are applied to all sub-layers and embedding layers,
    outputting a fixed dimension (d_model=512).
  - >-
    The decoder includes an additional sub-layer for multi-head attention over the encoder output
    and masks future positions.
  - >-
    Scaled Dot-Product Attention computes attention weights by taking the dot product of queries and
    keys, scaling by sqrt(d_k), and applying softmax, then multiplying by values.
  - >-
    Multi-head attention projects queries, keys, and values multiple times with learned linear
    projections before applying attention, improving performance.
  - >-
    Dot-product attention is faster and more space-efficient than additive attention due to
    optimized matrix multiplication, especially with scaling.
