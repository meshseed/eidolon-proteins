title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Synaptic Adhesions as Mechanical Information Processors'
summary: >-
  Synaptic adhesions, driven by talin switch patterns and mechanical forces, act as
  information-processing centers. These complexes encode information through protein recruitment and
  conformational changes, dynamically remodeling based on neuronal activity and contributing to
  memory consolidation.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic adhesions function as complex information-processing hubs by integrating mechanical
    signals and protein interactions.
  - >-
    Talin's switch patterns are central to dictating protein assembly and molecular recruitment at
    synaptic adhesion sites.
  - >-
    Mechanical forces and contractility changes dynamically alter talin switch states, leading to
    the encoding of information as patterns of '1s' and '0s'.
  - >-
    Post-translational modifications may regulate talin switch states, potentially
    'write-protecting' specific information patterns.
  - >-
    Neuronal remodeling and protein redistribution are consequences of these dynamic mechanical
    signaling processes.
  - >-
    Synaptic stimulation patterns directly influence the formation and consolidation of these
    informational patterns over time.
