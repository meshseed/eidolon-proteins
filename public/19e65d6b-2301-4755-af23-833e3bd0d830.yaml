title: 'Topological Equivalence: Rubber Sheet Geometry and Invariants'
summary: >-
  Topological equivalence, defined by homeomorphisms, allows continuous deformation of spaces
  without cutting or gluing, akin to 'rubber sheet geometry'.  Key topological invariants like hole
  count and connectedness are preserved under these transformations.
insights:
  - Spaces are topologically equivalent if continuously deformable into each other.
  - Homeomorphisms preserve fundamental structural properties (invariants).
  - The number of holes is a crucial topological invariant.
  - Topology studies properties invariant under stretching, bending, and twisting.
