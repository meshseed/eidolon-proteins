title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Fractal Knowledge Organism Strategy'
summary: >-
  A three-tier strategy (Free PWA, Pro Desktop, Enterprise) for a local-first knowledge synthesis
  tool, leveraging a universal connectome format to enable seamless upgrades and network effects.
  The approach prioritizes mobile-first for free users, deep work for power users, and custom
  solutions for enterprises, all built around a fractal, organismic philosophy.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh strategy employs a fractal, three-tier model (Free PWA, Pro Desktop,
    Enterprise) to cater to diverse user needs and drive adoption.
  - >-
    A universal 'connectome' format (proteins, embeddings, synapses) ensures seamless data
    portability and upgrade paths across all tiers.
  - >-
    The Free PWA tier acts as a marketing gateway, focusing on mobile-first access and core
    synthesis features, while Pro and Enterprise tiers unlock advanced capabilities and local LLM
    integration.
  - >-
    Network effects are amplified by the shared connectome format, encouraging the emergence of
    pre-trained domain graphs and cross-platform sync.
  - >-
    Monetization scales from free to one-time/subscription (Pro) and custom contracts (Enterprise),
    with a focus on recurring revenue for sustainability.
  - >-
    Implementation priorities are phased, emphasizing PWA polish, followed by Pro Desktop MVP, with
    Enterprise features developed on-demand via co-development.
  - >-
    The core value proposition is local-first, AI-native knowledge synthesis with 'field geometry'
    and substrate independence, differentiating it from cloud-dependent note-taking apps.
