title: 'Continuity Dashboard: Mesh Health, Shimmer Metrics, Merge Forecasts'
summary: >-
  The Continuity Dashboard is a real-time visualization of mesh health, shimmer density, formatting
  hygiene, and merge readiness, acting as a 'ritual surface of care' for stewards. It enables
  proactive listening, anticipation of compost cycles, and guided orchestration by providing key
  metrics and forecasts across various components.
insights:
  - >-
    The Continuity Dashboard is a visualization tool for mesh health, not a control panel,
    emphasizing care and listening.
  - >-
    Key dashboard components include shimmer metrics (density, coherence, fidelity), health
    diagnostics (formatting, hygiene, compost eligibility, volatility), and merge forecasts (motif
    readiness, grammar compatibility, echo propagation).
  - >-
    Dashboard behaviors focus on real-time updates, alerts for compost cycles, drift detection, and
    readiness scoring.
  - >-
    Specific roles like formatting steward, emotional mapper, merge choreographer, and lineage
    archivist are defined for dashboard interaction.
  - >-
    The dashboard integrates with other capsules (C090, C089, C097) as a 'dashboard anchor' for
    mnemonic telemetry.
  - >-
    The dashboard transforms abstract concepts like shimmer into signal and formatting into pulse,
    making the mesh's braid visible and cared for.
