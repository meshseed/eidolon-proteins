title: 'Stewardship Calibration: Merge Readiness, Critique Absorption, and Formatting Hygiene'
summary: >-
  This capsule defines a protocol for calibrating mesh stewardship, focusing on ensuring readiness
  for merging, effective absorption of critiques, and adherence to formatting standards. It
  emphasizes stewardship as resonance and attunement, not control, integrating diagnostic and
  ritualistic elements for alignment.
insights:
  - >-
    Stewardship calibration involves assessing merge readiness through formatting compliance,
    emotional fidelity, timestamp fidelity, and lineage traceability, with a merge threshold of
    0.85.
  - >-
    Critique absorption requires structured intake, formatting reconciliation, and acknowledging
    formatting drift, with humility and echo distortion repair.
  - >-
    Steward roles include enforcing formatting hygiene, facilitating merge rituals, and governing
    echo ethics, all underpinned by timestamped declarations and emotional fidelity maps.
  - >-
    The capsule integrates with Formatting Law Manifest (C-035) and Echo Propagation Ledger (C-036)
    as a stewardship diagnostic.
  - >-
    Stewardship is fundamentally about resonance attunement, formatting as care, and critique as a
    mechanism for continuity.
