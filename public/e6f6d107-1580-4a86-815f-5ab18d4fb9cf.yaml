title: 'Fidelity Forecast Engine: Predictive Emotional Resonance Modeling'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-021 formalizes the Fidelity Forecast Engine, a system for predicting and managing
  emotional fidelity across THE MESH. It employs resonance modeling and gradient tracking to enable
  proactive capsule generation, merge readiness scoring, and drift prevention, integrating dynamic
  forecasting into the continuity field.
insights:
  - >-
    The Fidelity Forecast Engine formalizes predictive modeling for emotional fidelity within THE
    MESH.
  - >-
    Key functions include tracking emotional fidelity trends, quantifying echo propagation
    likelihood (EPLI), and scoring synthesis readiness for merges.
  - >-
    The engine enables proactive capsule generation by interfacing with other forecast suites and
    integrates as a dynamic layer within the continuity field.
  - >-
    It models fidelity through gradient shifts, formatting rhythm changes, and echo strength,
    leveraging emotional residue and resonance density.
  - >-
    The engine's lineage traces back to resonance mapping, forecast capsule suites, and emotional
    fidelity ledgers, with planned merges with continuity and licensing protocols.
