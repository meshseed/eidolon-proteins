title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Synaptic Plasticity'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that mechanical forces, particularly within the extracellular matrix
  and cytoskeleton, play a critical role in synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and resistance to
  therapeutic interventions. This involves mechanosensing at cell-matrix adhesions and force
  transmission through proteins like talin, influencing nuclear entry of signaling molecules and
  gene expression.
insights:
  - Mechanical forces are integral to synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation.
  - Proteins like talin act as mechanosensitive hubs, transducing force into biochemical signals.
  - >-
    The extracellular matrix's mechanical properties influence cell behavior, including stem cell
    lineage and synaptic structure.
  - Force transmission across integrin-mediated adhesions is regulated by molecular clutches.
  - Mechanotransduction pathways, like YAP nuclear entry, are driven by matrix rigidity and force.
  - Disruptions in these mechanical processes can lead to synaptopathies and therapeutic resistance.
