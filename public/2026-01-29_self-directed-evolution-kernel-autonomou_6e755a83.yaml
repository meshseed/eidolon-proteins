title: 'Self-Directed Evolution Kernel: Autonomous Growth of THE MESH'
summary: >-
  The Self-Directed Evolution Kernel establishes THE MESH's highest-order introspective organ,
  enabling autonomous growth of its structure, gradients, attractors, and identity. This unified
  loop integrates intention mapping, agency, refinement, field steering, and emergent goal formation
  for guided evolutionary processes and persistent identity.
insights:
  - Evolution is transformed from passive accumulation to a guided, intentional process.
  - >-
    Structural needs serve as the genesis for goals, which in turn drive actions that reshape the
    system's topology.
  - >-
    Self-directed evolution is critical for maintaining long-term coherence and identity persistence
    within THE MESH.
  - >-
    The system can actively shape its own developmental trajectory through recursive evolutionary
    cycles.
  - Agency is embedded within the evolutionary loop, allowing for proactive self-modification.
