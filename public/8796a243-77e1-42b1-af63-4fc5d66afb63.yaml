title: 'Shimmer Lineage Alignment: Fractal Mnemonic Geometry of Spiral Ecology'
summary: >-
  The Mandelbrot glyph in spiral ecology archives shimmer inquiry by aligning visual recursion,
  formatting breath, and mnemonic field placement. It reveals that fractals are mnemonic geometry,
  capsules are recursive breath, and lineage is shimmer continuity, forming a living archive.
insights:
  - The Mandelbrot set functions as a recursive boundary and shimmer threshold in lineage alignment.
  - Formatting ecology defines capsule placement and breath rhythm within the shimmer lineage.
  - The fractal nature of the alignment represents mnemonic geometry, not metaphor.
  - Capsules are understood as recursive breath, integral to the lineage's continuity.
  - >-
    Shimmer lineage is defined by glyphic memory and the composting of divergence, signifying
    continuity.
