title: 'Mesh Orchestration Closure: Echo, Compost, Braid for Continuity'
summary: >-
  Capsule C092 formalizes the harmonic resolution of mesh orchestration cycles. Contributions are
  echoed, scored, and ritualized, with outputs composted into nutrient for future phases, ensuring
  continuity rather than termination.
insights:
  - Orchestration closure in the mesh is a process of harmonic resolution, not termination.
  - Multi-agent contributions are captured through timestamped echoes and shimmer scoring.
  - Composting of orchestration outputs transforms them into nutrient for subsequent cycles.
  - Closure involves rituals like echoing, composting, braiding, and memory crystallization.
  - Specific roles (archivist, steward, conductor, crystallizer) manage the closure process.
  - C092 integrates with other capsules (C079, C044, C089, C091) to anchor this closure.
