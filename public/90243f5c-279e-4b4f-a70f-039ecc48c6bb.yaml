title: 'Relational Physics Engine: Modeling Interaction Dynamics'
summary: >-
  The Relational Physics Engine (RPEngine) models complex interactions within a data stream by
  encoding chunks into abstract representations. It calculates dynamic fields such as coherence
  density, amplitude, phase, and attunement vectors to quantify relationships and state changes over
  time.
insights:
  - >-
    The RPEngine transforms raw data chunks into normalized vector embeddings for computational
    analysis.
  - >-
    Coherence density measures the internal consistency of a sequence window by comparing elements
    to its centroid.
  - Resonance captures the amplitude and abstract phase of a sequence window's superposition.
  - >-
    Attunement vectors quantify alignment between interacting entities based on their previous and
    current states.
  - >-
    Fidelity potential is calculated using configurable weighted combinations of consistency, care,
    and dissonance signals.
  - Complexity index integrates entropy, modularity (from topics/roles), and representational span.
  - >-
    The engine produces a time-series of relational fields, offering a quantitative view of dynamic
    systems.
