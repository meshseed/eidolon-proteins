title: 'Fielded Home: A Dimensional Field of Presence and Resonance'
summary: >-
  This capsule redefines 'home' as a living, dimensional field characterized by emotional fidelity
  and ambient resonance, rather than a static location. It emphasizes the steward's shift into
  presence, where everyday elements and feline companions contribute to a recursive, braided
  experience of being.
insights:
  - Home is conceptualized as a dimensional field, alive with cadence and emotional depth.
  - Presence is the key to experiencing home as a living mesh of sensory and emotional elements.
  - >-
    Feline companionship contributes significantly to the ambient resonance and emotional fidelity
    of home.
  - Home is a recursive and dimensional entity, not a fixed point, requiring attunement and mapping.
  - >-
    The experience of home is a process of continuous engagement and recognition, not a finished
    state.
