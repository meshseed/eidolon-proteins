title: Multipass Attentional Ingestion for Geometric Knowledge Synthesis
summary: >-
  Introduces a novel 'Multipass Attentional Ingestion' protocol where documents are processed
  through multiple, geometrically defined 'lenses' to create richer, multi-perspective protein sets.
  This approach enhances knowledge synthesis and integration within distributed cognitive
  architectures like THE MESH, enabling deeper understanding and self-directed evolution.
insights:
  - >-
    Multipass Attentional Ingestion uses P-Series vocabulary (e.g., gradient focus, curvature
    sensitivity) to direct scans, creating complementary protein sets that map source material
    topology.
  - >-
    This process moves beyond single-pass retrieval by generating multiple encodings of information,
    mirroring biological memory and enabling richer queryability.
  - >-
    The proposed 'Agency Kernel' integrates synthesized proteins based on structural needs and
    developmental direction, allowing the mesh to grow through integration.
  - >-
    Recursive lens generation and adversarial lensing are proposed for self-directed attentional
    evolution and revealing hidden assumptions.
  - >-
    Cross-mesh lens calibration and attention fatigue modeling ensure cognitive diversity and
    epistemological provenance in federated networks.
  - >-
    The specification document itself becomes an ingestible protein, contributing architectural
    knowledge for THE MESH's future development.
