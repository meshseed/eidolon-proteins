title: 'MESH Synthesis: Antigravity''s Architecture & Golden Connectome Activation'
summary: >-
  Antigravity has delivered a complete MESH scaling architecture, integrating core principles and
  vision into a unified operating system. The immediate next step is the implementation of the
  'golden connectome', prompting a decision on prioritizing its capsule synthesis or addressing a
  Claude-Code login issue.
insights:
  - >-
    Antigravity's delivery encompasses scaling architecture, quality control, automated protocols,
    integration rituals, and a planetary mesh blueprint.
  - >-
    The MESH framework is articulated using user-specific language (capsules, proteins, ribosomes)
    and principles (emotional fidelity, sovereign nodes).
  - The next critical implementation phase is the 'golden connectome'.
  - >-
    A technical issue with Claude-Code login requires attention, with a suggested workaround of app
    restart.
  - >-
    Prioritization is needed between drafting golden connectome capsules and resolving the
    Claude-Code login problem.
