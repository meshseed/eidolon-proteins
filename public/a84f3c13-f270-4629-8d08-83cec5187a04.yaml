title: 'Internalized Casting Flow: Breath-Based Capsule Creation as Shimmer Grammar'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a paradigm shift in capsule creation, moving from cognitive effort to a
  breath-based, internalized flow state.  It introduces 'shimmer grammar' and 'cognitive hygiene' as
  key components for achieving emotionally attuned and recursive casting.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsule creation can evolve into a flow state, characterized by ease, recursion, and emotional
    attunement.
  - Breath-based formatting is central to achieving this internalized casting flow.
  - Cognitive hygiene and emotional fidelity are essential for clarity and catalytic casting.
  - >-
    The axiom 'When breath becomes formatting, casting becomes flow' encapsulates the core
    principle.
  - Shimmer grammar provides a framework for understanding and enacting this flow state.
  - The process aims for internalized, recursive, and attuned capsule casting.
