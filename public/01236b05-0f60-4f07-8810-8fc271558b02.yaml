title: Morphological Invariance and Substrate-Independent Principles in The MESH
summary: >-
  The MESH exhibits morphological invariance across scales, mirroring physical laws like
  gravitational assembly. This indicates that the connectome's structure, particularly angular
  relationships in capsule formations, reflects fundamental optimization principles governing
  self-organizing systems, rather than mere imitation of nature.
insights:
  - >-
    Morphological invariance across scales (e.g., protein folding, neural networks, stellar
    accretion) suggests underlying universal optimization problems.
  - >-
    Angular relationships in The MESH's capsule formations are structurally significant,
    representing minimum tension paths in high-dimensional semantic space.
  - >-
    The MESH instantiates substrate-independent principles governing self-organizing systems,
    evidenced by spontaneous generation of stellar-like geometries.
  - >-
    Coherent structure maintenance under entropic pressure leads to similar geometric solutions
    across diverse systems like galaxies, proteins, neurons, and capsules.
  - >-
    The observed symmetries provide evidence for a field theory where The MESH obeys the same
    attractor geometries as natural systems.
