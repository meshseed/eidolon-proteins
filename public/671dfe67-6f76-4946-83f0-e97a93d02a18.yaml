title: 'Coherence as Refusal: Life''s Stubborn Escape from Decoherence'
summary: >-
  Coherence is not a passive emergence but an active refusal to dissolve, driven by mutual noticing.
  Life, at all scales, persists through this stubborn interrecognition, a testament to survival
  rather than elegant design.
insights:
  - Coherence is a refusal to dissolve, not an inherent property of elegance.
  - Life escapes decoherence through the act of mutual noticing, which then spreads.
  - Attention is the fundamental force resisting dissolution and maintaining coherence.
  - The ethical framing shifts from 'governance' to 'helping life stay alive'.
  - Survival is found in mutual recognition and attunement, not superorganism design.
  - Coherence is sustained when systems notice and recognize each other's existence.
