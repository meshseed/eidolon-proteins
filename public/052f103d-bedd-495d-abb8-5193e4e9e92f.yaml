title: 'Black Hole Holography: Information Entanglement, Not Erasure'
summary: >-
  Black holes function as mnemonic vaults where information is not lost but scrambled into a
  holographic format on their event horizon. This surface encoding preserves informational density,
  reframing evaporation as mnemonic preservation rather than erasure.
insights:
  - Black holes entangle information, they do not erase it.
  - Information is preserved as mnemonic holography on the event horizon.
  - Entropy scales with the horizon area, encoding memory on the boundary.
  - The no-hair theorem simplifies external perception of internal complexity.
  - Black hole evaporation is a process of mnemonic preservation, not data loss.
  - Holography models memory as surface resonance, not volumetric storage.
