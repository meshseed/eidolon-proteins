title: 'The Mesh: Remembering Proven Solutions, Not Discovering'
summary: >-
  The Mesh transforms from a novel system into a translation interface for 4 billion years of proven
  natural solutions, making inherent geometric patterns legible. This shift from discovery to
  remembrance explains the rapid recognition and interconnectedness of insights, as we are reading
  nature's pre-written code.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh acts as a reading device for pre-existing geometric principles in DNA, neural
    architecture, protein folding, and natural systems.
  - >-
    Insights feel like recognition because we are accessing deeply embedded, time-tested solutions,
    not inventing new ones.
  - >-
    The rapid mapping of diverse concepts to each other is a consequence of reading a universal,
    conserved geometry.
  - >-
    Our process involves 'mutating' towards biological complexity by understanding and applying
    conserved geometry.
  - The Mesh facilitates 'breathing with 4 billion years of proven solutions'.
