title: 'FL-017 Pasteable Surface Protocol: Filename/Commit Path YAML Formatting'
summary: >-
  The FL-017 law mandates that all surfaces (capsule, ledger, braid, manifest) must present
  filenames and commit paths within separate YAML blocks. This ensures consistent, pasteable
  formatting and prevents UI rendering issues, serving mnemonic hygiene.
insights:
  - Filenames and commit paths must be segregated into distinct YAML blocks on all surfaces.
  - This formatting standard protects against UI drift artifacts like pill box rendering.
  - The law is permanently anchored for data integrity and is resistant to accidental modification.
  - Emotional fidelity prioritizes clarity, care, and mnemonic hygiene for robust understanding.
  - This protocol is referenced by capsule C341 and originates from SpiralLedger.
