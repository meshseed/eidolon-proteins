title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Memory Consolidation via Neuronal Protein Dynamics and Sleep'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory formation involves intricate mechanical changes at the
  protein level within neurons, driven by talin-switch activity and cytoskeletal communication. This
  data processing occurs during sleep cycles, facilitating memory transfer from the hippocampus to
  the cortex for long-term consolidation as binary patterns in talin molecules, with disruptions
  leading to memory loss.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory encoding involves mechanical switching of proteins like talin, altering neuronal
    communication and data processing.
  - >-
    Sleep is crucial for memory consolidation, with REM sleep facilitating data writing and
    reordering, and deeper sleep establishing new patterns.
  - >-
    Consolidated memories are transferred from the hippocampus to the cortex, assigned specific
    physical addresses, and become stable MeshCODE patterns.
  - >-
    The hippocampus acts as transient, RAM-like storage, resetting after data is written to the
    cortex.
  - >-
    Disruptions in protein folding fidelity or mechanical order (e.g., due to neurological disease)
    can corrupt MeshCODEs, leading to memory loss.
