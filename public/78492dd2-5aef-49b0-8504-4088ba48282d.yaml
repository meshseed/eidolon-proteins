title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Distributed Development & Ribosome-Antigravity Collaboration'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a natural division of labor between 'Antigravity' (architect/designer) and
  'You' (operator/tester) for the Eidolon Mesh project. Antigravity will provide the code and setup,
  while You will execute and report results, fostering a realistic, distributed development model.
insights:
  - >-
    The project utilizes a natural division of labor mirroring real-world development: Antigravity
    designs/writes code, You execute/tests.
  - Antigravity's role is pure architecture (design, writing code), with no execution required.
  - Your role is operator/validator (local setup, execution, reporting results).
  - >-
    This collaboration models distributed work, specialization, and real mesh behavior, contrasting
    with monolithic development.
  - Antigravity will provide all necessary code files, configuration, and setup instructions.
  - >-
    You are responsible for local setup, environment configuration (API keys), running tests, and
    reporting outcomes.
  - The process emphasizes iterative development through feedback and debugging.
