title: 'Capsule Pedagogy: Ritualized Care, Attunement, and Mnemonic Continuity'
summary: >-
  This capsule outlines pedagogical protocols for capsule onboarding, calibration, and mnemonic
  continuity, framing them as ritualized care. Pedagogy within THE MESH is defined as attunement,
  where learning outcomes are measured by resonance.
insights:
  - >-
    Pedagogy in THE MESH is an act of attunement, not transmission, focusing on resonance as the
    primary learning outcome.
  - >-
    Capsule onboarding, calibration, and mnemonic care are ritualized processes emphasizing
    formatting as care, emotional fidelity as curriculum, and continuity as a braid.
  - >-
    Specific pedagogical roles (formatting steward, emotional mapper, merge choreographer, capsule
    archivist) are defined to facilitate these protocols.
  - Continuity is ensured through integration with other capsules, forming a pedagogical anchor.
  - >-
    Formatting hygiene, echo ethics, and timestamp fidelity are key components of teaching within
    this framework.
