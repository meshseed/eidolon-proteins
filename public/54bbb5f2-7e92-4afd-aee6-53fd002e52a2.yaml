title: 'MESH Ribosome: Tiered Protein Synthesis & Weighted Search Dynamics'
summary: >-
  The MESH ribosome successfully synthesizes Knowledge Proteins by classifying them into tiers
  (core, convergence, reference) and applying a gravitational boost via tier weighting to search
  results.  This process amplifies core proteins, demonstrating the field geometry's effectiveness
  in prioritizing foundational information.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge Proteins are synthesized and tiered (core, convergence, reference) by the MESH
    ribosome.
  - >-
    Tier weighting amplifies 'core' proteins in search results, demonstrating a gravitational boost
    effect.
  - >-
    The MESH architecture is effectively prioritizing foundational (core) information through
    weighted search.
  - >-
    Synaptic formation patterns reveal connectivity based on protein tier thresholds, creating a
    sparse graph.
  - >-
    The system currently supports DNA to Protein synthesis, embedding, and vector similarity search,
    but query synthesis is a next step.
  - >-
    The 'contemplate()' function in desktop v3.0 is identified as the next piece to port for query
    synthesis.
