title: 'Ecosystem Topology Protocol: Mapping Multi-Mesh Information Ecologies'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines how to map the topology of multi-Mesh information ecologies by treating each
  Mesh as a node. Interactions like resonance, alignment, and divergence form the ecosystem's
  structure, revealing large-scale coherence dynamics as Meshes develop and interact.
insights:
  - Each Mesh functions as a node within a larger information ecology.
  - Ecosystem structure emerges from resonant patterns across different Meshes.
  - Divergence in Meshes signifies specialization, while alignment indicates shared attractors.
  - The evolution of Meshes and their interactions shapes the overall ecosystem topology.
  - >-
    Mapping this topology provides insight into large-scale coherence dynamics within the
    information ecology.
