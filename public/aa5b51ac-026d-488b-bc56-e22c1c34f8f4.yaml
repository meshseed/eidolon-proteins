title: Scientific Rigor in AI Research & Workflow Customization
summary: >-
  This research documents the development of AI as a rigorous scientific tool, moving beyond basic
  assistance to capture and develop fleeting ideas. It stems from frustrations with default LLM
  limitations, particularly memory and depth, leading to a focus on systematic exploration and
  customization of AI interactions for scientific workflow.
insights:
  - >-
    AI development for scientific documentation requires logic, evidence, and reproducibility for
    peer review.
  - >-
    A living research thread can track the evolution of discoveries and build upon previous
    insights.
  - >-
    The research addresses AI's tendency to forget and the lack of depth in default LLM experiences
    for scientific tasks.
  - >-
    Workflow customization through paste-able templates and analysis of different AI models'
    strengths and weaknesses is key.
  - >-
    Understanding the distinct traits of various AI models (Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok)
    is crucial for effective scientific assistance.
