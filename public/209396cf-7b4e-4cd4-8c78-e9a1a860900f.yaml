title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Clarifying Public Repo Status and Next Steps'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project's public GitHub repository currently serves as documentation for
  validated metabolic cycles, not as a direct implementation. The core code is under local
  development and will be pushed publicly after stabilization and refinement.
insights:
  - >-
    The public GitHub repository for Eidolon Mesh is a documentation hub, not a direct code
    implementation, containing validated DNA samples and synthesized proteins.
  - >-
    The core metabolic cycle code has been validated locally but is not yet pushed to the public
    GitHub repository.
  - >-
    Option 1 (pushing code) is the long-term goal, requiring code cleanup, error handling, and
    documentation before public release.
  - >-
    Option 2 (adjusting README) is the immediate recommendation to accurately reflect the current
    state as a documentation/results repository.
  - >-
    The immediate action is to update the README's 'Usage' section to clearly state the repository's
    documentation-focused purpose and the implementation's stabilizing status.
  - >-
    The project plans to prepare for a full public code release by stabilizing the organism,
    cleaning up code, adding error handling, and creating essential documentation like
    CONTRIBUTING.md.
