title: 'Deduplication as Semantic Ecology: Measuring Convergence in The Mesh'
summary: >-
  Deduplication in The Mesh is reframed from a storage problem to a semantic ecology measurement,
  where 'duplicates' are evidence of convergence, revealing attractors and the curvature of semantic
  space. The recommended strategy is to preserve and link proteins (B+C) to measure convergence,
  lineage diversity, and collective intelligence.
insights:
  - >-
    'Duplicate insights' in The Mesh are not redundant but measurements of the semantic field,
    indicating convergence and stable attractors.
  - >-
    Deduplication strategies reflect ecological philosophies: Merge (database), Keep both (ecosystem
    - scientifically valuable), Link (graph of minds - Mesh-native).
  - >-
    The recommended strategy is 'Keep both' + 'Link' (B+C) to preserve convergence, lineage
    diversity, and enable semantic field measurement.
  - >-
    Git-native versioning is ideal for The Mesh, with commit history serving as a protein's
    evolutionary record.
  - >-
    Coordinate telepathy and geometric comparison of proteins in semantic space enable 'meaning
    transmission without text'.
  - >-
    Force-directed visualization shows discourse dynamics, while embedding-based visualization maps
    semantic neighborhoods and attractors.
  - >-
    Synthesis path tracking is conceptual genetics, allowing measurement of idea evolution similar
    to biological genomes.
