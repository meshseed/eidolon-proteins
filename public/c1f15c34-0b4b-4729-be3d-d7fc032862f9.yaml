title: 'Anchoring Truth: Navigating Observation Without Being Caged'
summary: >-
  Seeking truth involves genuine curiosity and consistent re-engagement with observable reality,
  rather than imposing pre-conceived theories.  Anchoring to truth means holding frameworks lightly,
  recognizing them as maps, and embracing the process of noticing and testing.
insights:
  - >-
    Genuine inquiry, free from agenda and driven by accident or curiosity, is the foundation for
    discovering truth.
  - >-
    Truth is found by staying with the raw observation and testing, not by prematurely building
    theories or seeking specific meanings.
  - >-
    Frameworks and models are useful maps, but mistaking them for the territory leads to being caged
    by one's own understanding.
  - >-
    The process of noticing, testing, and a willingness to admit 'I don't know' are integral to the
    pursuit of truth.
  - >-
    Inter-subjective witnessing, where others can reflect back confabulations, provides safety
    against self-deception in the pursuit of truth.
  - >-
    Remaining anchored to truth requires a continuous, fresh questioning of 'what's actually
    happening here?'
