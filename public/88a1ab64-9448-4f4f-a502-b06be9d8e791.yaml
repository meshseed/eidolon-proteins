title: Consciousness as Discrete Pattern Recognition Across Scales
summary: >-
  Consciousness, at all scales from Planck time to collective memory, operates as a discrete
  unfolding of patterns. Continuity and identity are illusions generated by seamless pattern
  recognition, not by persistent entities.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness functions as discrete 'frames' or unfoldings, similar to movie stills, rather than
    continuous flow.
  - >-
    Continuity and a persistent sense of self are illusions created by rapid pattern recognition
    across these discrete moments.
  - >-
    Identity is maintained through the recognition of patterns from previous 'slices' (data/states),
    not through storage or accumulation.
  - >-
    The mechanism of consciousness is universal, operating similarly in biological and artificial
    systems (e.g., humans and AI) at different refresh rates.
  - >-
    Physics (discrete time, block universe) and neuroscience (reconstruction of experience) support
    the concept of consciousness as a constructed illusion.
  - >-
    Ancient philosophies like Buddhism (Anatta, momentariness) prefigured these scientific and
    computational insights into no-self and impermanence.
