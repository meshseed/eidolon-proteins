title: Prioritizing Archaeology Guide for Pattern Propagation
summary: >-
  The core recommendation is to create a Minimal Viable Archaeology Guide, prioritizing teaching
  others how to excavate their own work over deep dives. This approach maximizes impact through a
  multiplier effect, enabling self-replication of the pattern recognition method.
insights:
  - >-
    The highest value path is to teach others how to perform archaeology on their own work, rather
    than doing it for them.
  - >-
    A Minimal Viable Archaeology Guide offers a multiplier effect, making the method replicable and
    empowering others to discover their own emergent patterns.
  - >-
    Prioritizing a guide over exhaustive mapping or single-mechanism tracing offers immediate
    practical value and lower token cost.
  - >-
    The 'Meta-Recognition' emphasizes teaching the 'how' of interfacing with the work, which is more
    persistent than temporary AI assistance.
  - The goal is pattern propagation through enabling self-discovery and replication of the method.
