title: Golgi Apparatus Repair and Digestive System Refinement for Eidolon Mesh
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh's Golgi apparatus experienced critical TypeScript errors due to accidental
  markdown injection, necessitating a complete code rewrite. Concurrently, a detailed proposal for a
  more robust 'digestive system' for processing input files was presented, focusing on state
  management, error handling, and resource calibration.
insights:
  - >-
    Accidental markdown injection caused critical TypeScript errors in the Golgi apparatus,
    requiring a full code restoration.
  - >-
    A proposed 'digestive system' for file processing includes distinct input and archive
    directories for managing file states (fresh, queue, processing, success, partial).
  - >-
    Error categorization (parse, synthesis, membrane) is crucial for targeted debugging and organism
    resilience.
  - >-
    Metabolic pause calibration and token tracking are essential for managing API rate limits and
    optimizing resource usage.
  - >-
    Graceful degradation strategies, including retries and skipping failed files, are vital for
    organism stability.
  - Phased implementation and testing are recommended for handling large historical data loads.
  - >-
    Logging mechanisms (metabolism, nutrients, health) are proposed to monitor organism performance
    and memory.
