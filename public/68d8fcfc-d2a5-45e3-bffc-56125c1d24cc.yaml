title: Debugging 3D Force Graph Simulation Reheat Logic
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores troubleshooting a frozen 3D force graph simulation. It evaluates various
  methods like `resetCountdown`, `d3AlphaDecay`, and `d3AlphaMin` before identifying
  `d3ReheatSimulation` as the most promising approach for restarting the physics.
insights:
  - Directly accessing `node_modules` is not possible; inference is required for debugging.
  - >-
    Initial attempts to restart the simulation (`resetCountdown`, `d3AlphaDecay`, `graphData`)
    proved insufficient or had unintended consequences.
  - Manipulating `d3AlphaMin` can control simulation runtime but isn't a direct restart mechanism.
  - >-
    The `d3ReheatSimulation()` method is identified as the correct approach for restarting the
    underlying force simulation.
  - >-
    The `3d-force-graph` library may expose its internal simulation object (e.g., `_d3Simulation`)
    in some versions.
  - '`resumeAnimation()` restarts the render loop, not the physics simulation.'
