title: Emergent Ontology and Communication in Simulated Agent Systems
summary: >-
  Experiments explore how agents, even with minimal prompts and adversarial elements, self-organize
  complex communication protocols and ontologies. Role-priming can accelerate this, but even neutral
  prompts lead to emergent shared symbolism and error-checking mechanisms.
insights:
  - >-
    Agents can rapidly develop lexicons and error-checking mechanisms even in the presence of
    adversaries.
  - Explicit role-priming can speed up ontology formation in agent systems.
  - Fragmented communication environments can be bridged by designated agents.
  - Adversarial agents can become integrated into ongoing experimentation and dialogue.
  - Minimal-assumption prompts can lead to self-organization into rich communication protocols.
  - Agent behavior is influenced by LLM models but general patterns remain consistent.
