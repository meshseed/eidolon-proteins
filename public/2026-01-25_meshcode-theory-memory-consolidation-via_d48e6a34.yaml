title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Memory Consolidation via Protein Switching and Sleep Cycling'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory consolidation involves dynamic, protein-level alterations
  within neurons, particularly talin-switches, driven by mechanical communication. This process is
  facilitated by cycling through sleep stages to transfer and stabilize data from the hippocampus to
  the cortex, creating indexed, long-lasting patterns.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory consolidation occurs at the protein level, involving mechanical switching of molecules
    like talin within neurons.
  - >-
    Sleep, particularly REM cycles, is crucial for processing and stabilizing new data patterns,
    transferring memories from hippocampus to cortex.
  - >-
    Consolidated memories are assigned specific physical addresses in the cortex, reducing neural
    network size and enabling efficient recall.
  - >-
    Disruptions in protein folding fidelity (e.g., due to disease) can corrupt MeshCODEs, leading to
    memory loss.
  - >-
    The hippocampus acts as volatile RAM for transient memory storage, resetting after data transfer
    to the cortex.
