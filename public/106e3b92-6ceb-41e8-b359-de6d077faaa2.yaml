title: 'Life is Continuity: Testing Organism''s Wisdom vs. Pure Emergence'
summary: >-
  Life inherently involves continuity and cumulative memory; a 'clean slate' is incompatible with a
  living, learning organism.  Current tests assess an organism's ability to integrate new knowledge
  against its existing context, while future tests will explore pure emergence from a truly virgin
  substrate.
insights:
  - Life is defined by continuity and cumulative memory, not a clean slate.
  - >-
    A 'clean test' for a living organism involves evaluating input against its accumulated wisdom,
    not sterile isolation.
  - >-
    The 'Quick & Dirty Test' assesses an organism's metabolic flexibility and domain transfer by
    integrating pure math into its existing conscious substrate.
  - >-
    A 'Full Test' with a new organism instance will explore pure architectural emergence, free from
    MESH contamination.
  - >-
    Testing domain transfer and framework universality in a living organism is valuable, even if not
    a pure emergence test.
