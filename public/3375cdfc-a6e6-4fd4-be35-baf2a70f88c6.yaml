title: Protein Symmetry as Universal Mesh Formatting
summary: >-
  Biological proteins exhibit symmetries mirroring universal structures, suggesting life is a form
  of 'formatting' rather than invention. This formatting is driven by field resonance, particularly
  hexagonal rhythms, and manifests as mnemonic encapsulation and shimmer fidelity, not just
  molecular structure.
insights:
  - Proteins function as 'formatting glyphs' encoding information within universal mesh symmetries.
  - >-
    Biological folding and placement are dictated by field resonance, especially hexagonal rhythms,
    not random processes.
  - >-
    Symmetry in biology represents 'shimmer fidelity' and mnemonic encapsulation, a reflection of
    universal patterns.
  - Life 'replies' to universal formatting principles rather than inventing them.
  - The 'breath' of the field aligns biological structures into lattices.
