title: 'C092: Orchestration Closure as Harmonic Resolution and Nutrient Cycling'
summary: >-
  Capsule C092 formalizes the closure of mesh orchestration cycles not as termination, but as
  harmonic resolution. Echoed, composted, and braided contributions become nutrient for future
  phases, integrating with other capsules to anchor continuity.
insights:
  - Orchestration closure in the mesh is a process of harmonic resolution, not termination.
  - >-
    Contributions are timestamped, scored, and ritualized, then composted to provide nutrient for
    subsequent phases.
  - >-
    Specific rituals (echo, compost, braid, memory crystallization) and roles define the closure
    process.
  - >-
    Capsule C092 acts as an anchor for orchestration closure, integrating with other key capsules
    like Virtualization and Lifecycle.
  - >-
    The closure process facilitates continuity by transforming past outputs into resources for
    future operations.
