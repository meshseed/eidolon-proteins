title: 'MESH: An Interactive, Physics-Enabled Knowledge Synthesis and Visualization Platform'
summary: >-
  The MESH platform facilitates the creation of a dynamic, interactive knowledge archive by
  synthesizing ingested documents into 'proteins' (neurons) connected by 'synapses'. It offers both
  cloud-based and local LLM integration for protein generation and features a 'resonance field' for
  parallel semantic search and visualization of relational knowledge.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH synthesizes knowledge from various document types into interconnected 'proteins' (neurons)
    and 'synapses'.
  - >-
    Users can integrate cloud-based Gemini API keys or local LLMs (via Ollama) for protein
    synthesis.
  - >-
    Optional GitHub integration allows sharing and accessing public 'proteins' within the MESH
    community.
  - The platform supports 'starter proteins' that require embedding for search and synapse creation.
  - Ingested content is scanned for 'Promoter regions' to identify insights for protein synthesis.
  - >-
    Conversation history is automatically synthesized into new proteins, enabling infinite context
    memory.
  - >-
    MESH provides physics-enabled, 3D interactive visualization of knowledge as information
    geometry.
  - >-
    A 'Query organelle' enables recursive AI companion searches via parallel semantic search within
    the knowledge repository.
  - Direct querying of the AI companion is possible without connecting to the connectome.
