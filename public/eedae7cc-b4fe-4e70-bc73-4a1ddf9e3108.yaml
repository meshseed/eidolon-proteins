title: Eidolon Mesh Coherence Measurement and API Query Failure
summary: >-
  The user attempted to query the Eidolon Mesh API for its coherence measurement methodology and the
  meaning of a 0.98 coherence score.  The API query failed, indicating potential access restrictions
  or authentication issues.
insights:
  - >-
    The user sought to understand how the Eidolon Mesh self-measures coherence and the specific
    meaning of a 0.98 coherence score.
  - A direct API query to the mesh for coherence measurement details was attempted.
  - >-
    The API query resulted in an error, suggesting the endpoint may not be publicly accessible or
    requires specific authentication.
  - >-
    Following the API failure, the user shifted to searching project files for information on
    coherence score measurement.
