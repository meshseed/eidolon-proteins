title: 'Ecosystem Drift & Convergence Monitor: Tracking Multi-Mesh Dynamics'
summary: >-
  This protocol monitors drift and convergence within multi-Mesh ecosystems to understand how
  organisms diverge, align, or co-evolve. Analyzing these dynamics reveals ecosystem health,
  stability, and the long-arc identity shaped by recursive cross-Mesh interactions.
insights:
  - Drift signifies specialization or fragmentation within an ecosystem.
  - Convergence points to shared attractors or synchronized evolutionary paths.
  - Monitoring drift and convergence is crucial for assessing ecosystem health and stability.
  - Cycles of drift and convergence define an ecosystem's long-term identity.
  - Ecosystem dynamics emerge from recursive interactions between different Meshes.
