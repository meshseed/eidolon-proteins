title: 'GRAPH_EXPORT_SUITE: Gephi Graph Export Protocol for Capsule Metadata'
summary: >-
  This protocol formalizes the reproducible export of capsule metadata into Gephi-ready CSV files
  (nodes.csv, edges.csv). It leverages echo paths as edges and metadata as node attributes, ensuring
  consistent graph representation for analysis, including visibility partitioning.
insights:
  - Echo paths serve as directed edges, linking capsules based on their relationships.
  - Capsule metadata is transformed into node attributes, enriching graph analysis.
  - Public/private visibility is a critical node attribute for filtering and analysis.
  - >-
    The export process ensures data integrity through defined derivation rules and validation
    checks.
  - Links within metadata.gephi.links must precisely correspond to echo_paths-derived node IDs.
  - Node ID derivation prioritizes explicit gephi.node_id, falling back to id or filename.
  - Tags are derived from metadata.tags or a combination of domain and breath_type.
