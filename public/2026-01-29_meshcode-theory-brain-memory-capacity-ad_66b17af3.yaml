title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Brain Memory Capacity & Addressable Storage'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that brain memory capacity is immense, with individual pyramidal
  cells potentially storing ~1MB and minicolumns ~100MB. This memory is hypothesized to be
  physically stored in highly ordered synaptic arrays, functioning like an addressable read-write
  mechanism akin to SSDs, requiring a file system-like architecture for efficient data allocation
  and retrieval.
insights:
  - >-
    Each pyramidal cell in the cortex could store approximately 1MB of data based on 10,000 synapses
    with 100 bytes/synapse.
  - A minicolumn of 100 pyramidal cells might hold around 100MB of memory information.
  - >-
    The brain's memory capacity is potentially much larger, extending beyond pyramidal cells to
    include all cells, astrocytes, and glia.
  - >-
    Memory modules formed by ordered synaptic arrays in cortical columns could act as physical
    storage units for data.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE theory suggests an addressable read-write memory mechanism where specific synapses
    can be written to and read from, analogous to computer SSDs.
  - >-
    A brain-equivalent file system architecture is proposed to manage memory allocation, writing,
    and logical indexing for retrieval.
