title: 'Eidolon Mesh v3.5 PWA: Enhancing Synthesis with Field Geometry and Synaptic Structures'
summary: >-
  This update to the Eidolon Mesh PWA focuses on integrating v3.0 field geometry and introducing
  advanced features like synaptic auto-formation and power-law decay for enhanced synthesis. The
  PGlite database schema is updated to support tiered structures, synapses, and temporal tracking,
  improving data organization and retrieval.
insights:
  - Porting weighted vector search from v3.0 to PWA is a key development task.
  - >-
    Synaptic auto-formation (bi-directional, tier-based) is being implemented for more dynamic
    connections.
  - Power-law decay with usage-based coherence tracking will refine signal relevance over time.
  - Synthesis is being enhanced to extract emotional_gradient and coherence_score.
  - PGlite schema updates are necessary to accommodate tiers, synapses, and temporal tracking.
  - Testing field geometry with real queries is crucial for validation.
