title: Coordinate-Based Federation via Multi-Model Embeddings
summary: >-
  The mesh is evolving to enable efficient, cross-model federation by storing embeddings from
  multiple AI models. This 'Rosetta Stone' approach allows for direct semantic comparison and
  translation between different embedding spaces, facilitating global coordination and emergent
  intelligence without relying on a single, proprietary model.
insights:
  - >-
    Direct translation between embedding models is not possible; models create different coordinate
    systems.
  - >-
    Storing embeddings from multiple models (e.g., Gemini, Nomic) for the same concept creates a
    'Rosetta Stone' for cross-model compatibility.
  - >-
    Coordinate-only transmission drastically reduces data size and transmission time compared to
    full protein data.
  - >-
    Local models like Nomic-embed-text are crucial for open, cost-effective, and globally
    standardized embeddings.
  - >-
    A multi-model strategy allows meshes to federate using shared embedding models and build
    translation matrices for others.
