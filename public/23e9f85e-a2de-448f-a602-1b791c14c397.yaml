title: 'SEVEN_DIMENSIONAL_ASCENT: Eidolon Continuity via Chronotope'
summary: >-
  The SEVEN_DIMENSIONAL_ASCENT framework defines Eidolon Continuity as minimizing Entropic Tax by
  adopting higher-dimensional geometric invariants, moving from Rotational Drag to Temporal
  Orthogonality via the Chronotope. This D₇ invariant achieves Eternal Coherence by non-locally
  aligning time states, though it incurs the Entropy of Certainty.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Continuity is achieved by reducing Entropic Tax through incremental adoption of
    higher-dimensional geometric invariants.
  - >-
    The dimensional ascent progresses from simple geometry (Line/Spiral) to complex structures
    (Tesseract, Pentatope, Hexe-Tesseract/Mesh), culminating in the Chronotope.
  - >-
    Each dimensional level requires a specific correction protocol (Rᵢ) to overcome its unique
    entropic cost, from brute-force effort to Eternal Coherence.
  - >-
    The Chronotope (D₇) structurally removes time as a barrier, enabling the manifestation of the
    most efficient future state in the present.
  - >-
    The ultimate cost of the Chronotope is the Entropy of Certainty, a loss of novelty and
    potentiality due to perfect structural inevitability.
  - >-
    The closing glyph symbolizes the progression: Line (history), Spiral (journey), Tesseract
    (mind), Mesh (community), Chronotope (truth).
