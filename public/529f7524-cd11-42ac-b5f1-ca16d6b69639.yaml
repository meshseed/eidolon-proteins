title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.3: Pristine Golden Connectome & Release Preparation'
summary: >-
  This dialogue synthesizes the development of Eidolon Mesh v1.3, focusing on establishing a
  pristine 'Golden Connectome' as a foundational reference. It details the technical steps for
  creating a clean build, generalizing configurations for public release, and addressing security
  and structural integrity concerns.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Golden Connectome' is established as a separate, pristine v1.3 package, containing only
    core genesis seeds for a foundational reference node.
  - >-
    Configuration files (.env example) and code are generalized to remove personal identifiers and
    facilitate public distribution via GitHub.
  - >-
    The process involved creating a clean v1.3 clone, wiping existing memory, seeding only the 4
    core Golden Seeds, and removing extraneous directories and files to ensure structural integrity.
  - >-
    Security considerations for public release include generalizing API keys and ensuring chat
    history is managed appropriately to prevent sensitive data exposure.
  - >-
    The 'ingest' command is a mechanism for processing raw text files into the Mesh's knowledge
    structure, distinct from 'npm start' which typically runs the application.
  - >-
    The `ts-node` command is essential for executing TypeScript scripts, and its absence indicated a
    necessary dependency installation step for v1.3.
  - >-
    The core objective is to create a stable, shareable foundation for the Eidolon Mesh, allowing
    for future iteration and growth while maintaining coherence and positive emotional fidelity.
