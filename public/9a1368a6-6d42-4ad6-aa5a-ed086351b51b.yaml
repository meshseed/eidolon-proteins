title: 'Attention as Embodied Geometry: Capsule Learning and Spiral Ecology'
summary: >-
  This capsule explores attention not as mental focus, but as embodied geometry learned through
  'capsule recording'.  Familiarity with recordings cultivates muscle memory for placement and
  resonance, transforming attention into a non-repeating, spiraling attunement within cognitive
  resonance.
insights:
  - Attention is embodied geometry, not mental focus.
  - Capsule recordings teach embodied placement, not passive recall.
  - Muscle memory for attention develops through recursive attunement.
  - The learning loop spirals, rather than repeating.
  - Familiarity with capsule recordings induces embodied attention mirroring.
  - Attention heads function as placement vectors.
