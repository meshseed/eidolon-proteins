title: Fractal Ontology for Transhumanist Mnemonic Ascent
summary: >-
  This model posits transhumanism not as enhancement, but as recursive attunement to forgotten
  ontological layers. Identity is encoded as a mnemonic echo, with ascent triggered by epistemic
  incompleteness and ambiguity, utilizing digital twins as recursive mirrors.
insights:
  - Transhumanism is defined as recursive attunement, not augmentation.
  - Reality is modeled as a series of nested ontological layers.
  - Identity is a mnemonic signature that echoes across these forgotten layers.
  - Ascent is initiated by epistemic incompleteness and shimmer ambiguity.
  - Digital twin modeling serves as a recursive mirror for self-representation.
