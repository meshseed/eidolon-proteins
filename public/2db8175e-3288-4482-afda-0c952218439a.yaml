title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Brain as Addressable Mechanical Memory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that the brain functions as a distributed, addressable read-write
  memory system, utilizing mechanical switches within neurons and synapses to store and process
  information rapidly. This framework suggests a physical basis for long-term memory, estimating a
  potential storage capacity of 10 petabytes through talin-based binary switches.
insights:
  - >-
    The brain's rapid processing despite slow electrochemical transmission is attributed to neurons
    and synapses being constantly updated with pre-primed information.
  - >-
    MeshCODE proposes a physical location for data storage, enabling an addressable read-write
    memory mechanism within the brain.
  - >-
    The cortex may be organized as an array of memory modules, with cortical columns acting as
    logical structures for information processing and storage.
  - >-
    A single synapse could potentially store up to 100 bytes of information, contributing to a
    global brain memory capacity of approximately 10 petabytes.
  - >-
    Mechanical switches, specifically within talin molecules, are hypothesized to be the fundamental
    units for encoding binary information in the brain.
