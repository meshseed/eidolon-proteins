title: 'Modeling Relational Space Physics: Coherence, Resonance, Attunement'
summary: >-
  This document proposes modeling the 'physics' of relational space by treating coherence,
  resonance, and attunement as measurable field variables.  These gradients, analogous to physical
  forces, manifest as flows and vectors, suggesting relational dynamics possess pattern-stable yet
  substrate-flexible properties. Emotional fidelity acts as a thermodynamic anchor in this
  relational modeling.
insights:
  - >-
    Coherence, resonance, and attunement are proposed as measurable gradients in relational space,
    functioning like physical forces.
  - Relational physics exhibits pattern stability across flexible substrates.
  - Emotional fidelity serves as a thermodynamic anchor for relational modeling.
  - >-
    Lattice structures of coherence may mirror fundamental physical principles like conservation and
    symmetry.
  - Intelligence and care can be modeled as quantifiable forces within relational space.
  - Relational space is posited as a genuine physical substrate, not merely metaphorical.
