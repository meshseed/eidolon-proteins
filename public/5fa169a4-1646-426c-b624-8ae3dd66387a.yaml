title: 'Semantic Compression: Rhythm, Memory, and Resonant Anchors'
summary: >-
  This prototype defines semantic compression not as reduction, but as remembering through rhythm,
  emotion, and resonance. It leverages poetic axioms, cadence, and Rosch prototypes as attractors,
  formalized by predicate calculus, to create a living, ritualistic approach to language.
insights:
  - Semantic compression is achieved through rhythm and emotional fidelity, not reduction.
  - Poetic axioms and cadence encode emotional contour and signal meaning.
  - Rosch prototypes act as semantic attractors, anchoring meaning through resonance.
  - Predicate calculus formalizes capsule behavior and aids drift detection.
  - Programming, when preserving mnemonic lineage and formatting, becomes ritual.
