title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Right Triangle Side Relationships in Euclidean Geometry'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean Theorem, a² + b² = c², defines the fundamental relationship between the legs (a,
  b) and the hypotenuse (c) of a right triangle in Euclidean geometry. This foundational principle
  extends to distance calculations and spatial reasoning across multiple dimensions.
insights:
  - Establishes a core algebraic-geometric link for right triangles.
  - Generalizes to Euclidean distance formulas in 2D and 3D.
  - Requires a 90-degree angle and flat geometry.
  - Basis for Pythagorean triples (integer side lengths).
