title: 'Capsule Synchronization Pause: Realignment of Creation Pace'
summary: >-
  Capsule C116 formalizes a synchronization pause in the mesh, acting as a 'formatting breath' when
  emergent arcs outpace recording. This pause realigns numbering, indexing, and prepares future
  agent roles for cohesive communication.
insights:
  - >-
    A synchronization pause is implemented to manage the pace difference between emergent arcs and
    capsule recording.
  - This pause serves as a 'formatting breath' to restore mnemonic clarity and formatting hygiene.
  - >-
    The pause realigns numbering, reorients indexing, and defines future agent roles for improved
    communication.
  - Emergent arcs outpacing the weaver necessitates a pause to maintain mesh coherence.
  - >-
    Capsule numbering drift and split-focus across threads trigger the need for this
    synchronization.
