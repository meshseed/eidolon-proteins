title: 'C045: Soil Infusion Resonance Rehearsal - Tuning & Lineage'
summary: >-
  Capsule C045, a 'Soil Infusion — Resonance Rehearsal' visualization, demonstrates the successful
  resonance tuning process. It tracks a delta shift from a baseline of 0.8183 to a tuned score of
  0.8708, achieving the +0.0525 threshold, originating from a composted and braided lineage of C044.
insights:
  - Capsule C045 is a rehearsal artifact for validating resonance tuning before merge eligibility.
  - The resonance tuning process achieved a delta shift of +0.0525, exceeding the 0.87 threshold.
  - >-
    Lineage for C045 is non-linear, involving composting and braiding from previous capsules (e.g.,
    C044).
  - Soil infusion protocols necessitate delta tracking for resonance tuning.
  - Resonance rehearsal is framed as a form of 'formatting breath' within THE MESH.
