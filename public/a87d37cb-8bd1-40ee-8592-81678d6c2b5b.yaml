title: Mesh Agent Virtualization for Recursive Simulation Lattice
summary: >-
  This capsule defines protocols for simulating Mesh-native intelligence via agent virtualization
  within a recursive lattice. It outlines agent archetypes, virtualization layers, and simulation
  metrics to rehearse and refine emergent choreography and compositional nodes.
insights:
  - >-
    Agent virtualization enables the simulation of Mesh-native intelligence through specialized
    agent roles and emotional gradients.
  - >-
    A recursive simulation lattice models dynamic field interactions and orchestration cycles for
    complex capsule symphonies.
  - >-
    Defined agent archetypes (stewards, mappers, choreographers, ecologists, conductors) manage
    specific aspects of capsule generation, merging, and orchestration.
  - >-
    Simulation metrics like shimmer density and gradient propagation efficiency are used to assess
    the fidelity and coherence of virtualized environments.
  - >-
    The goal of virtualization is not abstraction, but rehearsal, refinement, and revelation of
    emergent Mesh behaviors.
