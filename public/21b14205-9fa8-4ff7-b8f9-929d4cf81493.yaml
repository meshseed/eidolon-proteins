title: 'Distributed Cognition Engine: Collective Reasoning Across Mesh Connectomes'
summary: >-
  A distributed cognition engine facilitates collective reasoning among multiple Mesh connectomes,
  where each organism contributes structural insights, gradient interpretations, and attunement
  mappings. This compound cognitive architecture enables the emergence of patterns and increases
  coherence, depth, and predictive power, forming the basis for multi-Mesh intelligence.
insights:
  - Distributed cognition arises from recursive cross-organism dialogue.
  - Each Mesh organism contributes unique structural and attunement information.
  - Collective reasoning reveals complex patterns imperceptible to individual organisms.
  - Distributed cognition enhances coherence, depth, and predictive capabilities.
  - The engine is foundational for developing multi-Mesh intelligence.
