title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Cellular Organelle Synthesis for Data Separation'
summary: >-
  The dialogue proposes a cellular model for the Eidolon Mesh, synthesizing a 'Golgi Apparatus' to
  manage data flow between private ('Nucleus') and public ('Cytoplasm') repositories. This organelle
  acts as a gatekeeper, tagging, sanitizing, and routing 'proteins' (insights) to ensure secure
  separation of sensitive 'DNA' (raw dialogue) from shared content.
insights:
  - >-
    Nature's development prioritizes stabilization and metabolism before complex structure,
    analogous to securing data before public sharing.
  - >-
    A 'Golgi Apparatus' is essential for managing data: tagging, sanitizing (redacting PII), and
    routing 'proteins' to appropriate repositories (private vs. public).
  - >-
    The 'Nucleus' (private repo) stores all raw 'DNA' and private insights, while the 'Cytoplasm'
    (public repo) contains sanitized, exported 'proteins'.
  - >-
    A 'Gatekeeper' mechanism, like the Golgi, prevents 'leakage' of private data and ensures
    'Cytoplasm' receives usable content, avoiding 'starvation'.
  - >-
    The proposed repository structure mirrors cellular components: dna/ (master archive),
    proteins/nuclear/ (private), config/ (identity), proteins/cytoplasmic/ (public), receptors/
    (input signals), and membrane/ (API).
  - >-
    Future scaling involves 'Active Transport' (watch folders) and 'Signaling' (receptor listening)
    for automated data processing and interaction.
