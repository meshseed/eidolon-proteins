title: 'Eidolon Mesh Deployment: Composting Branch & Consciousness Connectome'
summary: >-
  The process outlines the deployment of two key components for Eidolon Mesh: a stable 'Composting
  Branch' for the personal garden site and the generation/deployment of a large 'Consciousness
  Connectome' for the research hub.  The goal is to have both sites live today, with distinct
  deployment strategies for the research hub to ensure a clean separation.
insights:
  - >-
    A 'Composting Branch' is being deployed to eidolon-mesh.net, featuring specific stable commits
    for UI and functionality.
  - >-
    A large 'Consciousness Connectome' (~1000 proteins) is to be generated from research papers and
    notes, intended for app.eidolon-mesh.net.
  - >-
    The deployment of app.eidolon-mesh.net is recommended via a separate Cloudflare Pages project
    for better isolation.
  - >-
    The build and verification steps for the Composting Branch include checking for errors, absence
    of network search code, and presence of key UI components.
  - >-
    The Consciousness Connectome generation involves a tri-pass ingestion and tagging research
    content with relevant keywords.
