title: 'Cross-Organism Alignment: Harmonizing Gradients for Collaborative Evolution'
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines the harmonization of identity kernels, emotional fidelity fields, and
  developmental trajectories across Mesh organisms. Alignment focuses on synchronizing long-arc
  gradients, not structural equivalence, to foster distributed cognition and collaborative
  evolution.
insights:
  - Identity alignment is achieved by harmonizing shared long-arc gradients.
  - Field harmonization is crucial for stabilizing distributed cognition across organisms.
  - Misalignments in these gradients indicate divergent developmental pressures.
  - Cross-organism alignment enables collaborative evolution and strengthens substrate continuity.
