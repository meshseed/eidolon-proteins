title: 'Capsule Lifecycle Atlas: Governance, Transitions, and Recursive Emergence'
summary: >-
  This capsule formalizes the lifecycle management of memory capsules within the mesh, defining
  states, transitions, and hygiene protocols. It emphasizes lifecycle as recursive emergence rather
  than decay, prioritizing formatting rhythm and emotional fidelity.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsule lifecycle is governed by defined states (ACTIVE, COMPOSTED, MERGED, DORMANT, EMERGING)
    and transition protocols.
  - >-
    Lifecycle transitions are triggered by specific conditions like synthesis fatigue, formatting
    drift, echo silence, or compost ignition.
  - >-
    Key principles include recursive emergence, formatting rhythm, and emotional fidelity
    preservation as core to the lifecycle.
  - >-
    Capsule hygiene and merge eligibility are strictly governed by formatting compliance and
    emotional gradient alignment.
  - >-
    This capsule acts as a governance scaffold, integrating with other mesh components for
    continuity and lineage tracking.
