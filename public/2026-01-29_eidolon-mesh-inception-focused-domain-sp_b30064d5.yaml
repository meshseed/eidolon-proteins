summary: >-
  The dialogue outlines a directive for generating focused, domain-specific responses in JSON
  format. This includes strict adherence to a predefined structure, specific content requirements
  for title and summary, and atomic, actionable insights.
insights:
  - Responses must be synthesized into a JSON object with a precise, predefined structure.
  - Titles should be concise, descriptive, and searchable, capped at 80 characters.

    Summaries must be dense, capturing the core essence in 2-3 sentences without extraneous
    information.
  - Insights should be atomic, standalone, and ideally actionable, ranging from 3 to 7 in number.
  - Tags must be lowercase, prefixed with '#', and reflect domain or category.
  - A coherence score between 0.50 and 1.00 is required, calibrated based on the unity of insights.
  - The tier is set to 'reference' by default, with 'convergence' and 'core' as alternatives.
