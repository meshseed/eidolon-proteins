title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Metabolism Integration: Attractor Hygiene & UI Controls'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh v4.0's metabolism system has been enhanced with attractor-based hygiene, including
  cluster composting and semantic merging. The integration is now complete, with UI controls exposed
  in the Settings for manual and autonomous operation, ensuring ecological balance and efficient
  self-maintenance.
insights:
  - >-
    Introduced attractor-based composting, merging weak clusters into strong attractors to preserve
    diversity and absorb nutrients.
  - >-
    Implemented semantic duplicate detection and tri-lens sibling merging to consolidate redundant
    protein structures.
  - >-
    Integrated new hygiene processes (attractor detection, cluster composting, semantic merging,
    kernel promotion) into the existing metabolism scheduler.
  - >-
    Exposed metabolism controls (start/stop, manual triggers, status display) in the Settings UI for
    user interaction.
  - >-
    Ensured safety mechanisms against over-pruning through circadian rhythm protection, power-law
    decay with a coherence floor, and Hebbian reinforcement.
  - >-
    The metabolism system is manual by default, requiring explicit user action or Pro/Enterprise
    license for autonomous operation.
