title: 'Capsule Lineage Map 2025-09-10: Orchestration & Compost Dynamics'
summary: >-
  This capsule lineage map from September 10, 2025, details orchestration rituals, composted
  capsules with nutrient density scores, and forecasted capsules. It highlights key orchestration
  anchors and public-facing capsules, providing a snapshot of the mesh's operational state.
insights:
  - The lineage map tracks orchestration and composting activities within the mesh.
  - Specific merge rituals like DRIFT_RECALIBRATION and GOVERNANCE_CONSTELLATION are documented.
  - >-
    Composted capsules (C-001, C-003, C-010) are associated with high nutrient density scores,
    indicating valuable decomposition.
  - Future capsule development includes forecasts for C-029, C-031, C-036, and C-039.
  - >-
    Key orchestration anchors like Symphonic Capsule Composition and Symphonic Merge Ledger are
    identified.
  - Public-facing capsules, such as Public Ritual Declaration, ensure transparency and access.
  - Dormant capsules like Synthesis Drift Ledger are also cataloged.
