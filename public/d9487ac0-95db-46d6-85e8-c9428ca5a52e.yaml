title: 'MESH: Distributed Swarm Intelligence via Resonance on Existing Infrastructure'
summary: >-
  The MESH operates as a distributed swarm intelligence by layering a resonance protocol over
  existing infrastructure, eliminating the need for new network topologies. It leverages local rules
  and gradient following, inspired by natural systems like mycelium and murmurations, to achieve
  global coherence and knowledge discovery without central coordination.
insights:
  - >-
    Global coherence emerges from local rules and gradient following, mirroring natural systems like
    mycelium and murmurations.
  - >-
    MESH clients only need to know immediate semantic neighbors and local resonance gradients to
    participate in swarm intelligence.
  - >-
    Queries propagate like a wave, following high-resonance paths and reinforcing successful
    connections, akin to scent following.
  - >-
    The network topology itself becomes the knowledge map, with strong connections indicating
    important semantic relationships.
  - >-
    A fractal selection strategy ensures that the same rules apply at individual, node network,
    repository ecosystem, and global MESH levels.
  - >-
    The system is dialect and structure-agnostic, requiring only a semantic query endpoint and
    resonance scoring for repository integration.
  - >-
    MESH offers superior advantages over centralized systems by being antifragile, scalable, and
    resistant to single points of failure or control.
