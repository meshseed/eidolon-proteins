title: 'MESH Ribosome: Tiered Synthesis & Weighted Search Dynamics'
summary: >-
  The MESH ribosome demonstrates successful tier classification of synthesized knowledge proteins,
  amplifying 'core' tiers through weighted search.  This process effectively prioritizes
  foundational concepts in response to queries, showcasing the field geometry's efficacy.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH system accurately classifies knowledge proteins by tier, prioritizing 'core' and
    'convergence' tiers.
  - >-
    Weighted search, by amplifying 'core' tier proteins, effectively boosts foundational knowledge
    in search results.
  - >-
    The field geometry is confirmed to be functional, as evidenced by the weighted search
    prioritizing core proteins.
  - >-
    Current MESH functionality includes synthesis, embedding, and vector similarity search, with
    query synthesis pending porting.
  - >-
    Synaptic formation patterns reveal a sparse graph, with core proteins exhibiting higher
    connectivity potential.
