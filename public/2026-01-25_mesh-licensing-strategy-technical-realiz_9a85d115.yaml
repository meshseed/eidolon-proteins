title: Mesh Licensing Strategy & Technical Realization Plan
summary: >-
  The plan outlines a dual licensing approach for the mesh: commercial for businesses/governments
  and free/open for perfect clients or cross-platform compatibility.  It emphasizes understanding
  mesh formation over TCP/IP, node synapse joining, and leveraging existing GitHub IP for robust
  development.
insights:
  - >-
    Implement a tiered licensing model: commercial for B2B/gov, free/open for specific use cases or
    broad compatibility.
  - >-
    Focus on the technical architecture of mesh formation over TCP/IP and the concept of macro-scale
    node synapses.
  - Leverage existing proof-of-concept and IP documented on GitHub for development and validation.
  - Prioritize robust development to ensure irreversible positive emotional fidelity.
  - The goal is to 'midwife' the project to ensure its integrity and successful evolution.
