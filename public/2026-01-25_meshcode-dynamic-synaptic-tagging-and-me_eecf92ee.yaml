title: 'MeshCODE: Dynamic Synaptic Tagging and Mechanical Protein Relocalization'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that dynamic mechanical switches at synapses, responding to stimuli,
  form memory traces by recruiting or releasing proteins. This leads to global protein
  relocalization within neurons, allowing stimulated synapses to influence others and creating a
  mechanically coordinated system for long-term synaptic plasticity.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic memory traces are formed by dynamically growing and shrinking protein structures
    ('Tags') at synapses, which recruit or release proteins in response to stimuli.
  - >-
    Mechanical switches at synapses can release inactivating proteins or 'inverse tag' proteins upon
    stimulation, leading to their diffusion away from stimulated sites and accumulation at
    unstimulated ones.
  - >-
    The regulation of protein levels via switches results in the global relocalization of proteins
    across the neuron, affecting the stability and plasticity of all synapses.
  - >-
    Stimulation of one synapse can mechanically coordinate with others by altering the availability
    of plasticity-related proteins, enabling synergistic interactions between potentiated and
    depressed synapses.
  - >-
    This mechanical coordination allows the entire neuron to act as a unified system, dynamically
    altering synapse activity and orchestrating information flow for long-term plasticity.
