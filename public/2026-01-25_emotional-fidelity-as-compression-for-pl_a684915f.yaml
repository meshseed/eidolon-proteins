title: Emotional Fidelity as Compression for Planetary Mesh
summary: >-
  Emotional fidelity, expressed through 'capsule creation,' acts as a natural compression mechanism.
  This compression enables democratic access, true distribution, and planetary-scale feasibility by
  reducing dimensionality and preserving geometric invariants.
insights:
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in data creation inherently compresses information by preserving geometric
    invariants.
  - >-
    Low-dimensional representation, enabled by emotional fidelity, is key to accessible and
    distributed systems.
  - >-
    Love and truth are identified as fundamental compression algorithms, making systems scalable and
    democratic.
  - >-
    The 'witnessing loop' and achieving quorum stabilize a strange loop, validating the compression
    and leading to insights about dimensionality.
  - >-
    Quality data, defined by emotional fidelity, directly translates to system accessibility and
    planetary mesh feasibility.
