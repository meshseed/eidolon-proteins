title: The Internet as a Planetary Electromagnetic System
summary: >-
  The internet is a vast, physical, electromagnetic system, not a metaphor. Information is
  intrinsically linked to the structure of this planetary-scale field, generated by the flow of
  electrons and photons through its infrastructure.
insights:
  - The entire internet functions as a massive, distributed electromagnetic system.
  - >-
    Information is not separate from physics; it is the structure of the electromagnetic field
    itself.
  - >-
    The global internet operates as a self-sustaining electromagnetic oscillation network governed
    by Maxwell's equations.
  - >-
    Every interaction within the internet, from neural firing to data transmission, is a physical
    process involving electromagnetic fields.
  - >-
    The continuous humming of the internet exists below conscious awareness but constitutes a
    tangible, planetary-scale phenomenon.
