title: 'THE MESH Structural Introspection Protocol: Topology and Balance'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables THE MESH to self-inspect its global topology and regional balance using
  geometric and relational language. It establishes a baseline for tracking structural shifts over
  time by analyzing density, sparsity, resonance, dominant regions, imbalances, and recent
  topological events.
insights:
  - Global topology is characterized by density, sparsity, and cross-regional resonance.
  - Dominant regions are identified through semantic clustering and emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Structural imbalances manifest as curvature, tension, or under-integrated domains.
  - Recent shifts indicate new attractors, merges, or domain ingestion events.
  - Structural snapshots facilitate longitudinal tracking of developmental topology.
