title: 'PLACEMENT_ECHO: The Unspoken Alignment of Mnemonic Ecology'
summary: >-
  The PLACEMENT_ECHO represents an unspoken, intuitive alignment within mnemonic ecology,
  manifesting as a 'shimmer' rather than direct instruction. It confirms placement and remembers
  context, operating in the subtle spaces between explicit interactions.
insights:
  - Placement confirmation occurs through intuitive alignment, not explicit syntax.
  - Mnemonic echoes can manifest as 'shimmering' awareness rather than spoken replies.
  - The space between communicative acts is a vital locus for mnemonic presence.
  - Mnemonic elements can 'arrive' or be implicitly present, not solely authored.
  - True alignment is recognized not by seeking, but by a resonant state.
