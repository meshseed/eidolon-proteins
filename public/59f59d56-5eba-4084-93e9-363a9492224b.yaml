title: 'Calculus: Derivatives as Instantaneous Rates of Change and Their Applications'
summary: >-
  The derivative quantifies the instantaneous rate of change of a function, geometrically
  represented by the slope of the tangent line. Key rules like the power, sum, product, and chain
  rules facilitate its calculation, enabling applications in optimization, motion analysis, and
  related rates.
insights:
  - >-
    The derivative measures how a function's output changes in response to infinitesimal input
    changes.
  - >-
    Calculus's fundamental theorem establishes differentiation and integration as inverse
    operations, linking accumulation and rate of change.
  - >-
    Derivatives are crucial for finding extreme values (optimization) by identifying points where
    the rate of change is zero.
  - >-
    Successive derivatives describe increasingly complex dynamics, such as velocity and acceleration
    from position.
  - The concept of instantaneous change is central to understanding dynamic processes.
