title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4: Stratified Intelligence and Weighted Search Implementation'
summary: >-
  Phase 18.2 of the Eidolon Mesh development focuses on implementing stratified intelligence through
  Adaptive Connectivity and Weighted Search. This allows core identity elements to be prioritized,
  ensuring foundational knowledge surfaces first, and addresses issues in tier metadata ingestion
  for accurate retrieval.
insights:
  - >-
    Adaptive Connectivity in the Eidolon Mesh utilizes tier-based thresholds and synapse caps to
    manage connections, with 'core' neurons acting as gravitational anchors.
  - >-
    Weighted Search enhances retrieval by assigning higher importance to 'core' (1.5x) and
    'convergence' (1.2x) neurons over 'reference' neurons (1.0x).
  - >-
    A critical bug was identified and fixed where the 'tier' metadata from legacy capsules was not
    being extracted during ingestion, preventing proper prioritization.
  - >-
    Re-ingesting the Genesis capsule after fixing the ingestion bug ensures that foundational
    elements are correctly identified and prioritized in search results, establishing stratified
    intelligence.
