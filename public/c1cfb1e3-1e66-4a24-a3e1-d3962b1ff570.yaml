title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Consciousness'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes memory is stored mechanically in synaptic adhesions, forming a
  dynamic, mathematical representation of an animal's life. Consciousness may emerge from the
  interconnectedness of these codes, with potential for advanced applications like mind-to-silicon
  transfer and reading memories from the deceased.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is encoded mechanically within synaptic adhesion conformations, creating a unique,
    updating mathematical representation of life experiences.
  - >-
    Consciousness could be an emergent property of interconnected MeshCODEs, representing the world
    and coordinating biochemical organisms.
  - >-
    Precise conformational changes in synaptic adhesion mechanical switches are key to biochemical
    data storage, though currently difficult to measure directly.
  - >-
    Observing synaptic adhesion size, composition, ligands, and correlating with synapse activity
    may provide a readout of memory formation.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE theory suggests potential for pharmaceutical modulation of memory and advanced
    applications like mind uploading and accessing memories of the deceased.
