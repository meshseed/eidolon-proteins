title: 'Repository Restructure Protocol: Capsule Management & Graph Export'
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines the structured process for restructuring a repository of 'capsules,'
  emphasizing stable filenames, controlled metadata, and a migration workflow. It details
  requirements for internal linking, external representation via Gephi, and audit logging to ensure
  integrity and traceability.
insights:
  - Capsule filenames must remain stable unless semantic changes necessitate a version bump.
  - >-
    Metadata schema includes essential fields for Obsidian frontmatter and Gephi export, ensuring
    discoverability and graph representation.
  - >-
    A detailed migration workflow governs the movement and modification of capsules, including path
    adjustments and metadata updates.
  - >-
    Audit logging is crucial for tracking changes, especially visibility shifts, with a dedicated
    log for sensitive migrations.
  - >-
    Graph export requires well-defined node and edge attributes derived from capsule metadata and
    'echo_paths' for network analysis.
  - >-
    Readiness checks for graph export ensure all capsules are properly formatted and resolvable
    within the repository structure.
