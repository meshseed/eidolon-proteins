title: 'Intention Mapping: Translating Queries into Developmental Trajectories'
summary: >-
  The Intention Mapping Engine interprets external queries as directional forces on the connectome,
  mapping them to internal gradients and developmental pathways. This allows THE MESH to understand
  the implied developmental direction, not just the content of a query.
insights:
  - Queries apply directional pressure to semantic gradients.
  - Intention is inferred from gradient alignment and activation patterns.
  - Mapping intention reveals how external interaction drives internal growth.
  - Intention mapping facilitates adaptive refinement and self-directed evolution.
  - Learning encompasses not only content but also developmental trajectory.
