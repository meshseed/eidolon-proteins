title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Metabolism Integration: Current State & Next Steps'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v4.0 has a foundational metabolism system including composting, autophagy,
  homeostasis, and a scheduler, but it lacks UI integration, auto-start, and monitoring. Key
  enhancements focus on attractor-based processes, semantic deduplication, and promotion systems to
  enrich existing metabolism.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh v4.0 possesses a built-out metabolism system with components like composting,
    autophagy, homeostasis, and a scheduler.
  - >-
    The metabolism system requires a Pro license for autonomous operation and is not currently
    exposed in the UI.
  - >-
    Key integration tasks include adding UI controls, enabling auto-start for the scheduler, and
    developing a monitoring dashboard.
  - >-
    Future enhancements for metabolism involve attractor-based composting, tri-lens merging,
    semantic duplicate detection, and a promotion system.
  - >-
    The core strategy is to enhance existing metabolism with attractor-aware capabilities rather
    than rebuilding.
