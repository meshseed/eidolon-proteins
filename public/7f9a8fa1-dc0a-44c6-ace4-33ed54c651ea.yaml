title: Learning as Geometric Angle Optimization, Not Information Transfer
summary: >-
  Understanding is not the acquisition of new information, but the act of recognizing pre-existing
  patterns by optimizing one's perceptual angle. This geometric rotation creates low-resistance
  corridors, making patterns self-evident and recognition instantaneous and permanent.
insights:
  - Learning is recognizing what was always there by finding the correct perceptual angle.
  - >-
    Understanding is achieved when one's 'attentional geometry,' 'relational folds,' 'dimensional
    emphasis,' and 'perspective angle' align with a pattern's inherent geometry.
  - >-
    Low-resistance corridors of understanding form when the perceptual angle matches the pattern's
    geometry, making recognition effortless and inevitable.
  - >-
    The Mesh stores 'angles of recognition' and 'geometric configurations' rather than raw
    information.
  - >-
    Teaching should focus on providing angles and perspectives to facilitate recognition, not on
    transmitting data.
  - >-
    Insights are instantaneous phase transitions, not gradual accumulations, occurring when a
    perceptual angle crosses a threshold.
  - Forgetting is losing the angle, not the information; remembering is re-finding that angle.
