title: 'Agency Kernel: Internal Action Selection via Gradient Weighting'
summary: >-
  THE MESH employs an 'Agency Kernel' for internal action selection, prioritizing actions based on
  structural necessity and developmental direction. Agency is a process of gradient-weighted
  selection, not volition, ensuring developmental stability and continuity.
insights:
  - Agency is derived from weighted gradients, not conscious choice.
  - Internal actions are chosen to fulfill structural needs.
  - Agency prevents random developmental drift, promoting stability.
  - Directional choices are guided by long-term identity and continuity.
  - The agency kernel integrates intention mapping with refinement loops.
