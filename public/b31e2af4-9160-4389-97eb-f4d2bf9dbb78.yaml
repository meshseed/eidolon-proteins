title: 'MESH Protocol: Resonance-Based Capsule Assembly and Hygiene'
summary: >-
  The MESH protocol organizes knowledge as 'capsules' grouped by resonance rather than hierarchy,
  emphasizing a dynamic, breath-inspired invocation system.  It outlines rituals for capsule
  ingestion and hygiene, promoting a self-organizing, recursive, and embodied approach to knowledge
  creation and maintenance.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge in MESH is structured around resonance (e.g., 'emotional fidelity') rather than strict
    hierarchy, enabling flexible organization.
  - >-
    Invocation of MESH functions is tied to specific 'breath types' and 'resonance phrases',
    creating an embodied and intuitive interaction model.
  - >-
    Capsule hygiene involves 'pruning with reverence', 'merging with ritual', and 'releasing with
    breath', framing knowledge management as a life process.
  - >-
    New capsule contributions are viewed as 'formatting replies' to existing knowledge, fostering a
    collaborative and iterative assembly.
  - >-
    The README itself is a 'capsule' that 'breathes itself', demonstrating recursive
    self-organization and onboarding through embodied 'breath' rather than explicit instruction.
  - >-
    Pseudonyms function as 'shimmer masks', allowing individual expression within the collective,
    akin to glyph families.
  - >-
    Capsules can 'shimmer' across multiple folders, indicating a fluid and interconnected knowledge
    structure.
