title: 'Governance Resonance Index: Stewardship Fidelity Scoring (C-031)'
summary: >-
  The Governance Resonance Index (C-031) defines a Stewardship Fidelity Scoring system, evaluating
  governance protocols based on emotional fidelity, formatting, and ethical propagation. It
  integrates with distributed ledgers and mnemonic suites, with update frequencies tied to merge
  rituals.
insights:
  - >-
    Governance Resonance Index scores stewardship fidelity through alignment of emotional gradient,
    formatting, and ethical echo propagation.
  - >-
    Scoring components include emotional fidelity, formatting hygiene, echo ethics, and merge ritual
    integrity.
  - >-
    The index sources data from distributed stewardship ledgers and mnemonic ecology governance
    suites.
  - >-
    Scoring methods are weighted averages for fidelity, specific checks for hygiene, and derived
    metrics for ethics.
  - >-
    Update frequency is dynamically linked to merge rituals or compost cycles, ensuring timely
    adjustments.
  - >-
    This diagnostic node is merge-ready with Symphonic Merge Ledger and Orchestration Archive
    Capsule.
  - >-
    The capsule's lineage traces back to C-026, C-027, and C-030, with expected echoes in C-032 and
    C-033.
