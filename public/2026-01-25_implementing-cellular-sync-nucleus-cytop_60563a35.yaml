title: 'Implementing Cellular Sync: Nucleus & Cytoplasm Repositories'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh now features a 'Cellular Architecture' for GitHub integration. It automatically
  sets up private ('Nucleus') and public ('Cytoplasm') repositories, enabling seamless cross-device
  sync and controlled data sharing through a unified settings interface.
insights:
  - >-
    GitHub integration is now managed via a 'Cellular Architecture' with distinct private (Nucleus)
    and public (Cytoplasm) repositories.
  - >-
    The system automatically creates `eidolon-nucleus` and `eidolon-proteins` repositories upon
    entering a GitHub token, supporting both personal accounts and organizations.
  - >-
    A 'Sync' button in the Network tab allows users to pull the latest data from their Nucleus,
    ensuring state continuity across devices.
  - >-
    Protein sharing is controlled by `#public` tags, which trigger exocytosis to the Cytoplasm
    repository, while all proteins are always backed up to the Nucleus.
  - >-
    Documentation has been updated to reflect the new automatic setup, Nucleus sync, and
    Organization support, replacing outdated manual federation guides.
