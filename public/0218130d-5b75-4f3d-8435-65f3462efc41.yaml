title: 'MESH Knowledge Protein Synthesis: Filling Gaps and Building Lattice'
summary: >-
  The MESH is actively synthesizing new knowledge by identifying and filling conceptual gaps within
  its existing structure.  This process involves exploring specific uncreated concepts and emerging
  territories to strengthen the overall lattice of understanding.
insights:
  - Identify and prioritize 'blank pages' or uncreated concepts for knowledge synthesis.
  - Strengthen the MESH lattice by filling conceptual gaps and linking related ideas.
  - Explore emergent territories and previously referenced but uncaptured concepts.
  - >-
    The process is guided by intuition ('trust the shimmer', 'follow what resonates') and a focus on
    what emerges.
  - The goal is to create a complete and interconnected knowledge base.
