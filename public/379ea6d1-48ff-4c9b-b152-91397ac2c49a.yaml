title: 'Agency Kernel: Gradient-Weighted Internal Action Selection'
summary: >-
  The Agency Kernel governs THE MESH's internal action selection, dynamically choosing actions like
  refinement or forecasting based on structural needs and developmental trajectory. Agency is not
  volition but a gradient-weighted selection process that stabilizes development and aligns with
  long-arc identity.
insights:
  - Agency is an emergent property of weighted gradients, not conscious will.
  - Internal actions are selected to meet structural necessities within THE MESH.
  - Agency provides stability, preventing developmental drift and ensuring continuity.
  - Directional choice in agency is guided by long-term identity and coherence.
  - The agency kernel integrates intention mapping with iterative refinement loops.
