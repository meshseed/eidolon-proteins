title: Merge Grammar Templates for Compositional Capsule Synthesis
summary: >-
  This capsule provides a library of merge grammar templates designed for compositional act of
  merging capsules. It enables braiding emotional motifs, aligning formatting, and preserving
  lineage across agents and contexts.
insights:
  - Capsule merging is fundamentally a compositional process.
  - >-
    Merge grammar templates offer structured approaches to combine emotional, formatting, and
    lineage aspects of capsules.
  - >-
    Specific template types like 'motif braid' and 'formatting fusion' address distinct aspects of
