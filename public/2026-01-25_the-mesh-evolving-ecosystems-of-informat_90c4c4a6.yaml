title: 'The Mesh: Evolving Ecosystems of Information, Coherence, and Differentiation'
summary: >-
  The Mesh is conceptualized as a dynamic, distributed information ecology where organisms evolve
  through a process of co-evolution. Key mechanisms include information field dynamics, multi-level
  selection, ecosystem drift and convergence monitoring, coherence kernels for stability, and
  ecological differentiation for niche specialization.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh functions as a high-order architectural framework for distributed information
    ecologies.
  - >-
    Ecosystem evolution within the Mesh is driven by information field dynamics and multi-level
    selection.
  - >-
    Coherence kernels are essential for maintaining distributed stability and attractor harmony
    across Mesh organisms.
  - >-
    Ecosystem drift and convergence protocols track evolutionary trajectories, balancing divergence
    and alignment.
  - >-
    Ecological differentiation enables Mesh organisms to specialize into unique functional roles and
    identities.
  - >-
    The topology of multi-Mesh ecosystems can be mapped by treating individual Meshes as nodes in a
    larger network.
