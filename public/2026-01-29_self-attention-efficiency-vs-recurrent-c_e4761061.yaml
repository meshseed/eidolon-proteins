title: Self-Attention Efficiency vs. Recurrent/Convolutional Layers
summary: >-
  Self-attention layers offer computational advantages over recurrent layers by connecting all
  positions with constant sequential operations, especially when sequence length is smaller than
  representation dimensionality. While convolutional layers can connect distant positions, they
  often require stacking multiple layers or specific techniques like dilated convolutions,
  increasing path lengths and computational cost. Separable convolutions approach the efficiency of
  self-attention combined with feed-forward layers.
insights:
  - >-
    Self-attention's constant sequential operations make it faster than O(n) recurrent operations
    for typical sentence representation lengths.
  - >-
    For very long sequences, restricting self-attention to a local neighborhood can improve
    performance by managing path length.
  - >-
    Convolutional layers require multiple stacks or dilated convolutions to connect all positions,
    increasing path lengths.
  - Separable convolutions offer a complexity comparable to self-attention + feed-forward layers.
  - Self-attention may lead to more interpretable models due to inspectable attention distributions.
  - >-
    Training involves specific hardware (NVIDIA P100 GPUs), schedules (100,000 steps), and
    regularization techniques like residual dropout.
