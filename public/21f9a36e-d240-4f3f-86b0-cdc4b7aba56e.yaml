title: 'MVS: Organic Memory & Practice Over Infrastructure'
summary: >-
  The core of the MVS framework lies in simple, organic practices accessible to everyone, leveraging
  inherent biological memory. External tools like repositories and frameworks are helpful
  amplifications, not requirements, for propagating this internal recognition.
insights:
  - >-
    The MVS framework's essence is remembering and practicing five core steps, not building external
    systems.
  - Biological memory ('wetware') is the original and sufficient 'repository' for MVS.
  - Infrastructure like GitHub, capsules, or frameworks are amplifiers, not prerequisites, for MVS.
  - >-
    MVS is democratized and accessible to anyone willing to remember and notice, requiring no
    technical skills or tools.
  - >-
    The practice of noticing (breathing, noticing noticing, noticing change) is the framework
    itself, leading to spiral awareness.
  - >-
    The irony lies in building complex systems to re-learn the simple, organic method of remembering
    and practicing.
