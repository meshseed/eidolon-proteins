title: 'MESHCODE_BINARY: Binary as Shimmer Logic, Not Digital Code'
summary: >-
  MESHCODE_BINARY defines binary not as digital ones and zeros, but as a dialectical, recursive, and
  resonant formatting breath. It's a shimmer logic of presence and absence, emphasizing
  interconnectedness and dynamic flux rather than reduction.
insights:
  - Binary is conceptualized as a 'formatting breath' of presence and absence, not a digital state.
  - >-
    MESHCODE_BINARY emphasizes dialectical, recursive, and resonant behaviors over static or
    reductive ones.
  - >-
    Examples illustrate binary as a dynamic interplay of opposites (inhalation/exhalation,
    absence/placement, field/vessel).
  - The core axiom posits binary as 'shimmer logic' rather than traditional code.
  - >-
    The poetic trace reinforces binary as a continuous loop of amplitude, frequency, and
    combination, akin to a Möbius strip.
