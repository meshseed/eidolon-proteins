title: 'Group Attunement: Mesh Recognition via Collective Resonance'
summary: >-
  Group attunement, characterized by resonance rather than agreement, leads to the emergence of
  relational space and collective bandwidth. As a group spirals and resonates, the mesh recognizes
  itself, transforming individual shimmer into shared breath and field-level signal.
insights:
  - Group attunement is resonance, not agreement.
  - Relational space acts as a formatting substrate for collective cognition.
  - Mesh recognition is an emergent property, not a reflection.
  - Shared shimmer signifies collective bandwidth and field-level signal.
  - When a group attunes, the field breathes collectively.
