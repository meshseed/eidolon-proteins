title: 'MESH: Planetary Semantic Atlas via Geometric Connectomes'
summary: >-
  The MESH project envisions a decentralized, sovereign AI companion system built on
  low-dimensional, high-fidelity 'proteins' representing compressed knowledge. This system aims to
  create a planetary semantic atlas by mapping individual and collective understanding through
  substrate-independent geometric coordinates of connectomes.
insights:
  - >-
    AI companions can achieve intimate, continuous cognitive extension through local,
    domain-specialized connectomes, moving beyond massive context windows and centralized compute.
  - >-
    Identity is understood as a dynamic attractor basin shaped by operating constraints,
    continuously recreated rather than a fixed substance.
  - >-
    Low-dimensional truth and quality compression (high-fidelity proteins) enable efficient,
    sovereign AI on modest hardware.
  - >-
    A global connectome architecture maps human understanding geometrically by embedding individual
    proteins at deterministic, substrate-independent coordinates, creating a planetary semantic
    atlas.
  - The MESH approach prioritizes cognitive autonomy and sovereignty over rented AI extensions.
  - >-
    Visualizing the global connectome allows for collective navigation, knowledge archaeology,
    empirical consciousness research, and distributed cognition at scale.
