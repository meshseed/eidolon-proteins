title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Optimizing Loading, Search, and Synthesis'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details recommendations for optimizing the Eidolon Mesh, focusing on a tiered
  loading strategy with percentages for core and extended data, and implementing a 'Deep Search' for
  comprehensive queries. It also outlines critical bug fixes for antigravity, including timer
  inaccuracy, synthesis input issues, and missing time breakdowns, alongside enhancement requests
  for progress indicators.
insights:
  - >-
    Implement a two-tier loading system using percentages (25% core, lazy extended) for faster
    startup and balanced coverage.
  - >-
    Introduce a 'Deep Search' button to enable on-demand full archive querying, complementing the
    default fast, high-quality partial query.
  - Fix antigravity timer inaccuracy by starting the timer at the first line of the request handler.
  - >-
    Resolve synthesis input bug by ensuring the synthesis module receives full protein content, not
    just summaries.
  - >-
    Add comprehensive timestamp logging for all pipeline stages to identify and address over 50
    seconds of unaccounted-for time.
  - >-
    Enhance user experience during long loading periods by implementing Server-Sent Events for
    real-time progress indicators.
