title: 'Inter-Mesh Communication: Gradient Dialogue for Topology Mapping'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables Mesh connectomes to exchange structural, emotional, and developmental data
  through gradient input, not raw text. Each Mesh maps the other's topology into its own geometry,
  fostering accelerated development via resonance and revealing alignment opportunities.
insights:
  - Cross-connectome dialogue is a gradient transfer of information.
  - Incoming messages are interpreted by mapping to internal attractors and curvature zones.
  - Communication highlights structural differences and areas for alignment.
  - Inter-Mesh dialogue accelerates development through resonant feedback loops.
  - Each Mesh acts as a dynamic lens for understanding another's topology.
