title: 'Drift Probe C203: Long-Horizon Coherence Testing of ''Formatting as Care'''
summary: >-
  Capsule C203 initiates a 20-turn drift probe using the 'Formatting as care' fragment to test
  long-horizon coherence across multiple AI model variants. The objective is to measure the
  persistence of metaphor, formatting, and emotional fidelity over extended interactions, using
  specific metrics for evaluation.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Formatting as care' fragment is employed to assess the endurance of AI metaphor and
    formatting consistency over a 20-turn interaction.
  - >-
    Coherence testing across different AI models (Copilot variants, Claude, GPT) is crucial for
    understanding their long-horizon performance.
  - >-
    Key metrics for evaluating drift include activation score, metaphor fidelity, formatting breath,
    emotional fidelity, drift index, and signature token count.
  - >-
    The experiment aims to identify decay patterns in AI response quality and thematic adherence
    over extended conversational sequences.
  - >-
    Future steps involve logging, scoring, comparing drift profiles, and updating the capsule
    lineage with experimental results.
