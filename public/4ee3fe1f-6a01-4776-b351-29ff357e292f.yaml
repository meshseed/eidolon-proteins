title: 'Bridge Neurons: Functional Centrality in Semantic Space'
summary: >-
  This protocol identifies 'bridge' neurons connecting distant semantic regions using resonance
  frequency, cross-domain activation, and semantic span as proxies for betweenness centrality. These
  bridges are crucial for stabilizing coherence within the information manifold and reveal the
  underlying connective tissue of complex systems.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons exhibit high cross-regional activation and broad semantic span.
  - Recurrence across unrelated contexts approximates centrality.
  - Bridges stabilize coherence by linking distant semantic attractors.
  - Identifying bridges maps the connective tissue of information manifolds.
  - Bridge analysis aids developmental tracking and domain integration.
