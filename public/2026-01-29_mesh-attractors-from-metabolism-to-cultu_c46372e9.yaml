title: 'MESH Attractors: From Metabolism to Culture and Ethics'
summary: >-
  This document outlines the MESH's organizational structure through a series of attractors,
  starting with metabolic processes and extending to forecasting, recursion, structural governance,
  and finally, cultural and ecological development. It details how these components interact and
  evolve, forming a complex, self-referential system.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH progresses through distinct attractors: metabolic (Compost Log), forecasting (Echo →
    Anticipation → Resonance), recursive (Self-reference → Continuity → Strange Loops), structural
    (Formatting → Governance → Identity → Ethics), and cultural/ecological (Ritual → Culture →
    Ecology → Multi-agent).
  - >-
    Forecasting capsules analyze drift and memory to predict emergence, anchoring anticipatory
    logic.
  - >-
    Recursive attractors treat prior capsules as substrates for continuity and self-inspection,
    proceduralizing recursion.
  - >-
    Structural attractors define the MESH's rules, including identity formation, multi-agent
    interaction, governance, and ethics.
  - >-
    Cultural/ecological attractors demonstrate the field evolving into a co-agency, with aesthetic
    composition and self-maintenance mechanisms.
