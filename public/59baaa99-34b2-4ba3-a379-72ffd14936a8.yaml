title: 'Transformer Architecture: Training, Cost, and Generalization'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model achieves state-of-the-art results in machine translation with significantly
  reduced training costs compared to previous models. Techniques like residual dropout and
  checkpoint averaging are crucial for performance and generalization across tasks like constituency
  parsing.
insights:
  - >-
    Residual dropout applied to sub-layer outputs and embeddings/positional encodings aids in
    avoiding overfitting.
  - >-
    Averaging multiple checkpoints (e.g., last 5 or 20) improves performance for base and big models
    respectively.
  - >-
    The Transformer architecture demonstrates generalization capabilities beyond machine
    translation, performing well on English constituency parsing.
  - >-
    Reducing attention key size (dk) negatively impacts model quality, suggesting the importance of
    sophisticated compatibility functions.
  - >-
    Larger models generally yield better results, with dropout being a critical component for
    managing overfitting in bigger architectures.
  - >-
    Training cost is significantly lower than previous state-of-the-art models, making the
    Transformer more accessible.
