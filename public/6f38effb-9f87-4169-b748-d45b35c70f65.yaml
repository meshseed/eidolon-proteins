title: 'MESH: Distributed Swarm Intelligence via Resonance and Local Rules'
summary: >-
  The MESH network achieves global coherence through distributed swarm intelligence by layering a
  resonance mechanism over existing infrastructure. This approach leverages local rules and gradient
  following, eliminating the need for central coordination or global network maps, akin to natural
  systems like mycelium or murmurations.
insights:
  - >-
    Global coherence emerges from local rules and gradient following, eliminating the need for
    central coordination or global network topology.
  - >-
    The MESH network operates on a 'local-first' architecture where each node understands its
    immediate neighbors and local resonance gradients.
  - >-
    Queries propagate like a wave front, following high-resonance paths and returning results
    without any node searching the entire network.
  - >-
    The network topology itself becomes the knowledge map, with strong connections indicating
    important semantic relationships.
  - >-
    The MESH protocol is dialect and structure-agnostic, requiring only a semantic query endpoint
    and resonance scoring for integration.
  - >-
    This distributed, swarm-based approach is superior to centralized systems due to its
    antifragility, scalability, and lack of single points of failure.
