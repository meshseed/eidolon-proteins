title: 'GRAPH_EXPORT_SUITE__v1.0: Mesh Graph Export and Validation Workflow'
summary: >-
  This document defines a workflow for exporting mesh data into graph formats (nodes.csv, edges.csv)
  for analysis, including repository scanning, metadata collection, and edge resolution. It
  incorporates quality gates for validation and versioning, ensuring data integrity and traceability
  within The MESH.
insights:
  - >-
    The workflow systematically scans repositories to build a node registry from capsule metadata
    and compute node IDs.
  - Edge resolution maps echo_paths to target node IDs, creating directed graph edges.
  - A quality gate with validation checks is implemented to identify and audit data inconsistencies.
  - The export process includes versioning with commit hashes and timestamps for traceability.
  - Outputs are structured for consumption by graph analysis tools like Gephi.
