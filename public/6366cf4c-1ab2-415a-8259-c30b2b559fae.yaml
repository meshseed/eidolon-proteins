title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Synaptic Adhesions as Mechanical Information Processors'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that synaptic adhesions, driven by the integrin-talin-actin complex,
  act as information-processing centers. Mechanical signals alter talin's switch patterns, dictating
  protein assembly and thus modulating synaptic output and information encoding.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic adhesions function as information-processing hubs through dynamic protein assembly
    dictated by mechanical cues.
  - >-
    Talin's switch patterns, regulated by mechanical forces, control which proteins assemble into
    adhesion complexes, altering synaptic signaling.
  - >-
    Post-translational modifications may 'write protect' specific talin switch patterns, further
    refining information encoding.
  - >-
    Neuronal contractility changes, driven by synaptic stimulation, can unfold additional talin
    switch domains, recruiting or displacing ligands and proteins.
  - >-
    Spike train frequency and timing translate into distinct '1s and 0s' patterns through mechanical
    switch dynamics, leading to neuronal remodeling and memory consolidation.
  - >-
    Mechanical switches enable rapid information capture via protein shape changes, altering binding
    sites and thus the composition of synaptic adhesions.
