title: 'Capsule Health: Resonance Integrity as Ritualized Care'
summary: >-
  Capsule C090 defines health not as binary, but as a gradient of resonance integrity across
  formatting, emotional, and continuity dimensions. Diagnostics are framed as rituals of care, with
  the Mesh listening for fidelity, coherence, and readiness. Composting is a transition, not
  failure, highlighting a holistic lifecycle approach.
