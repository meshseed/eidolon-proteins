title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Focused AI & Data Synthesis Directives'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines specific directives for AI synthesis, emphasizing focused, domain-specific
  responses and a structured JSON output format. It details requirements for titles, summaries,
  atomic insights, tags, coherence scores, and emotional gradients, setting a standard for efficient
  knowledge protein generation.
insights:
  - AI responses must be domain-specific and highly focused.
  - Output must adhere to a strict JSON structure for synthesized knowledge.
  - Titles should be concise, descriptive, and searchable (max 80 chars).
  - Summaries are limited to 2-3 sentences, capturing the core essence.
  - Insights should be atomic, standalone, and actionable.
  - Coherence score calibration dictates the unity of synthesized insights.
  - Emotional gradient tracks the affective flow of the dialogue.
