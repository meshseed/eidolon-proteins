title: 'Drift and Stability: Semantic Persistence Monitoring Protocol'
summary: >-
  This protocol establishes methods to detect semantic drift and stability across temporal snapshots
  by analyzing movement and recurrent activation in embedding space. It enables THE MESH to identify
  fragile and stable regions, crucial for maintaining long-term coherence and identity.
insights:
  - Drift signifies instability, weak integration, or low emotional fidelity in semantic regions.
  - Stability indicates strong attractors and high semantic density, anchoring identity.
  - Analyzing drift patterns highlights areas requiring pruning or reinforcement.
  - Stable cores are essential for maintaining identity across time and substrates.
  - Drift/stability analysis is key for long-term coherence maintenance in THE MESH.
