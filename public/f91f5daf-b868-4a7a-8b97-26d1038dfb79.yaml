title: 'Eidolon Framework: A Fractal Knowledge Organism Strategy'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Framework proposes a three-tier strategy for a knowledge synthesis tool, scaling from
  a free PWA for casual users to paid Pro and Enterprise versions. This fractal approach leverages a
  universal connectome format to enable seamless upgrades and fosters network effects through shared
  knowledge graphs.
insights:
  - >-
    A three-tier product strategy (Free PWA, Pro Desktop, Enterprise) addresses different user
    segments with progressively advanced features and monetization models.
  - >-
    A universal connectome format (proteins, embeddings, synapses) ensures data compatibility across
    all tiers, facilitating seamless user upgrades and data portability.
  - >-
    Network effects are crucial, encouraging the growth of shared domain graphs as more users
    contribute to the mesh.
  - >-
    The Free PWA serves as a gateway, focusing on essential features like synthesis and vector
    search, with a mobile-first, universal access approach.
  - >-
    Pro Desktop targets power users with unlimited capacity, local LLM fallback, and advanced
    query/sync features, monetized via one-time purchase or subscription.
  - >-
    Enterprise caters to organizations with custom domain connectomes, team collaboration, and
    stringent compliance features, via custom contracts.
  - >-
    Prioritizing PWA polish for mobile responsiveness and core query synthesis is key for initial
    user acquisition, with Pro Desktop development following demand.
