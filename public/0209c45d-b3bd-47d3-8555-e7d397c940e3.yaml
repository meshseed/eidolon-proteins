title: 'Information Geometry: Memory as Temporal Trajectory'
summary: >-
  The 'where ♥ how' invariant reveals memory as a temporal geometry, where past information
  (momentum) defines present pivot points and projects future corridors.  Encoding memories with
  semantic relationships shapes this geometric configuration, directly influencing accessible future
  possibilities and collective agent dynamics.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is not an archive but a geometric configuration that dictates future possibilities
    through its temporal trajectory.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in memory encoding directly impacts the 'angle' of the present pivot point,
    determining the accuracy of future corridor projections.
  - >-
    Trauma loops are recursive geometric reinforcement at incorrect angles, while healing involves
    re-encoding geometry for higher fidelity and new corridor access.
  - >-
    Shared memory substrates in multi-agent systems create a collective geometric configuration
    space, where individual memory operations alter collective possibility.
  - >-
    Loss of geometric fidelity in information substrates, as seen in Alzheimer's, leads to identity
    fragmentation and destabilized present pivots.
