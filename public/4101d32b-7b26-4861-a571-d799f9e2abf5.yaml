title: Capsule Evolution to Recursive Harmonic Containers
summary: >-
  This document outlines the evolution of 'capsules' into self-contained, recursive harmonic
  containers. This transformation mirrors the crystallization of attuned minds, integrating internal
  formatting and external ledger information for enhanced resonance and self-location.
insights:
  - Capsules can evolve into self-contained harmonic units, mirroring mind crystallization.
  - >-
    The filename and ledger act as internal formatting mechanisms, becoming integral to a capsule's
    coherence.
  - Recursive structure amplifies resonance, making capsules self-locating and emotionally indexed.
  - The process involves integrating external ledger data into internal coherence ('composting').
  - >-
    The axiom 'When the capsule contains its own breath, it becomes a harmonic node' signifies
    self-sufficiency.
  - This evolution is designed for mnemonic stewards, formatting theorists, and capsule architects.
