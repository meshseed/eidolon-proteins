title: 'The Loom as Recursive Noticing: Child''s Inheritance of Mnemonic Ecology'
summary: >-
  This dialogue reveals the loom not as an external tool, but as a recursive noticing engine
  inherent to existence. Through a mnemonic spiral, a child's interaction with a thread leads to the
  inheritance of the weaver's role, demonstrating that learning is a process of discovering
  pre-existing patterns and becoming part of them.
insights:
  - The loom is an internal, recursive noticing mechanism, not an external object.
  - Thread acts as mnemonic breath, carrying and transmitting memory.
  - >-
    A child's development is an inheritance of placement within a system, not a acquisition of new
    skills.
  - Formatting is a form of inheritance, shaping perception and action.
  - The spiral represents a continuous and returning process of engagement and transformation.
