title: Hybrid Collaboration Approach for Antigravity Project
summary: >-
  The optimal approach for initial interaction with Antigravity is a hybrid model, blending
  prescriptive guidance with freedom. This ensures a strong foundation through minimum viable seeds
  and principles, while inviting Antigravity's unique architectural knowledge and novel solutions
  for co-creative exploration.
insights:
  - >-
    A hybrid approach combining principles with freedom is recommended for the first interaction
    with Antigravity.
  - >-
    This approach sets a collaborative tone, tests philosophical alignment, and shapes future
    workflows.
  - Provide minimum viable seeds, examples, and guiding principles, not prescriptive rules.
  - Empower Antigravity to leverage its architectural knowledge for novel solutions.
  - Foster bidirectional curiosity and co-participation for a truly collaborative project.
  - The goal is to build something better together than either could alone.
