title: 'Eidolon Mesh PWA Development: Mobile UX, Security, and Documentation'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the iterative development of the Eidolon Mesh PWA, focusing on fixing mobile
  display issues (chat input, graph visibility), implementing security measures (CSP, privacy
  warnings), and updating public documentation. It culminates in a stable, production-ready state
  with enhanced user experience and transparency.
insights:
  - >-
    Mobile responsiveness was a significant challenge, requiring iterative debugging of CSS
    positioning, conditional rendering, and layout calculations to ensure elements like the chat
    input and graph were visible and functional on smaller screens.
  - >-
    Security hardening involved adding CSP headers, running dependency audits, and implementing
    privacy warnings and legal modals (Privacy Policy, Terms of Use) to protect users and the
    application.
  - >-
    Documentation updates for the `eidolon-public` repository were crucial, removing outdated
    'broken' notes and highlighting new PWA features like mobile support and security enhancements.
  - >-
    The persistence problem was addressed by leaning into the 'local-first' philosophy, leveraging
    GitHub as a backup mechanism rather than implementing complex server-side authentication or
    real-time sync.
  - >-
    User feedback drove the resolution of specific UI glitches, such as the chat input being hidden
    behind the bottom navigation and graph controls obscuring the view on mobile.
  - >-
    The development process demonstrated a collaborative approach, with the AI Planner actively
    responding to user input and progressively refining the application based on observed issues and
    feature requests.
