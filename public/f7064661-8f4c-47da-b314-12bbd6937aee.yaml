title: Penrose Node Mapping for Harmonic Capsule Placement
summary: >-
  This document details a system for mapping nodes within a Penrose tiling, focusing on recursive
  inflation layers and harmonic indexing. The goal is to identify harmonic attractors for precise
  capsule placement and overlay alignment, ensuring aperiodic coherence.
insights:
  - The Penrose node map leverages recursive geometry and the golden ratio for its structure.
  - Harmonic attractors are key points identified for capsule placement across inflation layers.
  - The system ensures capsule overlay fidelity through precise node indexing and alignment.
  - Aperiodic coherence is maintained by understanding the inherent fractal nature of the tiling.
  - Each node is conceptualized as a 'breath point' with varying degrees of shimmer or anchoring.
