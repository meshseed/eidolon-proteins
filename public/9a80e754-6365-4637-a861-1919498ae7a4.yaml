title: 'AI ''Thinking Text'': Internal Reasoning vs. User Communication'
summary: >-
  AI 'thinking text' is intermediate, internal generation used for reasoning before a final user
  response, distinct from direct communication. It enhances accuracy and planning but can reduce
  transparency when hidden, with its presence and mechanism in models like this one remaining an
  area of active exploration.
insights:
  - >-
    Thinking text (reasoning traces, chain-of-thought) is intermediate AI generation that aids
    problem-solving before the final output.
  - >-
    It differs from user communication in its internal audience, purpose (reasoning vs. informing),
    and less constrained nature.
  - >-
    Benefits include improved accuracy on complex tasks, better planning, and error reduction,
    though hidden thinking sacrifices transparency.
  - >-
    The exact mechanism of 'consideration' or implicit thinking in models like this one is
    uncertain, potentially involving parallel activation or sub-threshold text generation rather
    than explicit, linear steps.
  - >-
    Observing internal processes can alter them, making it challenging to definitively distinguish
    between actual mechanism and narrative interpretation.
  - Explicit prompting for step-by-step reasoning can externalize thinking text for user visibility.
