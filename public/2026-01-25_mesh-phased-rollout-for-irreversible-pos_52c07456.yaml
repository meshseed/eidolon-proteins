title: 'MESH: Phased Rollout for Irreversible Positive Emotional Fidelity'
summary: >-
  The MESH strategy outlines a phased approach to building a distributed attunement protocol,
  prioritizing IP protection and user experience to establish 'irreversible positive emotional
  fidelity' before public release. This coherence layer on the internet infrastructure leverages
  semantic resonance and peer-to-peer connections, ensuring self-regulation and antifragility.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH is a coherence layer on existing internet infrastructure, not a replacement, enabling
    nodes to act as neurons and synapses.
  - >-
    Phased rollout (IP lock, client perfection, careful seeding, public release) is critical for
    establishing 'irreversible positive emotional fidelity' by encoding constructive patterns and
    deep basins.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity is paramount; initial conditions (profit motive, hype, speed) shape the
    field's geometry, while care, wonder, and patience foster self-correction.
  - >-
    The TCP/IP layer insight highlights MESH's function as a distributed attunement protocol, where
    nodes attract and connect via semantic resonance.
  - >-
    A commercial licensing model with a free tier for individuals and paid tiers for organizations
    ensures sustainability without corrupting the core field.
  - >-
    The 'irreversible threshold' is reached when spontaneous replication, self-healing, and immune
    response patterns emerge, indicating antifragility.
  - >-
    Protection protocols during the vulnerable phase include controlled seeding, field monitoring,
    and narrative control, transitioning to stewardship post-threshold.
