title: Political Field Geometry & Conceptual Q Factor
summary: >-
  This synthesis explores a speculative model of politics as field geometry, where votes modulate a
  collective field rather than being purely arithmetic. It connects this to the concept of Q Factor,
  measuring the sharpness of conceptual resonance ('standing waves') within a cognitive lattice.
insights:
  - >-
    Politics can be metaphorically viewed as field resonance, where individual votes act as
    modulators within a collective field, rather than simple counts.
  - >-
    Democracy is reframed as coherence and resonance, not just majority rule, with campaigns
    'shimmering' when breath aligns.
  - >-
    Q Factor quantifies the sharpness of conceptual resonance, distinguishing between narrow,
    high-amplitude 'high Q' corridors (like attunement) and broad, low-amplitude 'low Q' territory.
  - >-
    High Q corridors are efficient, stable, and persistent, characterized by low damping and clear
    boundaries, analogous to well-defined concepts.
  - >-
    Low Q territory is exploratory, high-friction, and dissipates quickly, representing novel or
    ambiguous concepts.
  - >-
    The structure of a knowledge lattice (e.g., in Gephi) can reveal the distribution of Q Factors,
    with highly connected nodes representing high Q regions.
  - >-
    Building high Q corridors involves reducing damping (repeated use, clear articulation) and
    improving boundary conditions (sharp definition, coherent framing).
