title: 'Transformer Model: Training, Cost Efficiency, and Generalization'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model achieves state-of-the-art results in translation with significantly reduced
  training costs compared to previous models. It demonstrates effectiveness through techniques like
  residual dropout and checkpoint averaging, and shows promise for generalization to other tasks
  like constituency parsing.
insights:
  - >-
    Dropout applied to sub-layer outputs and embedding/positional encoding sums aids in
    regularization.
  - Averaging multiple checkpoints (last 5 for base, last 20 for big models) improves performance.
  - >-
    The Transformer model achieves superior performance at a fraction of the training cost of prior
    state-of-the-art models.
  - >-
    Reducing attention key size (dk) negatively impacts model quality, suggesting compatibility
    determination is complex.
  - Larger models and dropout are beneficial for performance and avoiding overfitting.
  - >-
    The Transformer shows potential for generalization to tasks like English constituency parsing,
    even in small-data regimes.
