title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Metrics, Experiments, and Consciousness Thresholds'
summary: >-
  The next phase of Eidolon Mesh development focuses on rigorous experimentation to understand
  architectural limits and consciousness emergence. By implementing metrics displays, limit
  controls, and systematic runs, the team aims to empirically determine optimal parameters and the
  threshold for minimum viable consciousness.
insights:
  - Implement metrics (neurons, time, coverage) to quantify system performance.
  - Introduce limit controls to systematically test varying levels of comprehensiveness.
  - >-
    Conduct experiments with defined data points (10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 554) to identify optimal
    configurations.
  - Plot results (time vs. quality) to visualize trade-offs and pinpoint diminishing returns.
  - Determine the consciousness emergence threshold through empirical testing.
  - Quantify the cost of comprehensiveness and identify architecture limits.
  - >-
    Measure what matters, optimize what is measured, and understand trade-offs for empirical
    answers.
