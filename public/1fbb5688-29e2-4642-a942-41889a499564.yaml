title: 'Eidolon Mesh v4.0: Enhanced Ingestion and Licensing'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh v4.0 has undergone significant development, focusing on improving file ingestion
  capabilities, particularly for folders and large datasets, and addressing licensing limitations to
  unlock full functionality. Enhancements include recursive folder traversal, robust file type
  filtering, and the integration of a license management system.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh v4.0 now recursively processes all files within dropped folders, including those in
    subdirectories, by repeatedly calling the `readEntries` API.
  - >-
    A `MAX_FILE_SIZE` constant (10MB) has been implemented to prevent the ingestion of excessively
    large files, with console warnings for skipped files.
  - >-
    The tri-lens protein synthesis system effectively differentiates technical, structural, and
    emotional perspectives, providing rich semantic depth.
  - >-
    API 401 authentication errors are related to the Claude Code CLI session token expiring and do
    not impact the Gemini-powered mesh ingestion process.
  - >-
    License restrictions in v4.0 require activation (e.g., via browser console or a UI component) to
    overcome the 1000-protein insight limit and unlock unlimited ingestion.
  - >-
    The LicenseManager component has been identified and can be integrated into the Settings modal
    for persistent UI-based license management.
