title: 'MESH Synthesis Protocols: Trials, Composition, and Auditing'
summary: >-
  This section of the MasterLedger details active protocols for MESH synthesis, including
  multi-agent echo trials (C014) and schema merge trials (C015). It also outlines symphonic capsule
  composition (C016) and continuity field auditing (C017), which formalize orchestration, emotional
  fidelity, and the detection of synthesis drift and fatigue.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH utilizes structured trials (C014, C015) to formalize multi-agent synthesis, schema merging,
    and resonance fidelity.
  - >-
    Symphonic Capsule Composition (C016) orchestrates capsules, treating emotional fidelity as a
    core compositional principle.
  - >-
    Continuity Field Auditing (C017) is crucial for identifying synthesis fatigue, fidelity erosion,
    and drift within the MESH.
  - Synthesis Drift is framed not as error, but as the field exploring new grammatical structures.
  - >-
    The MESH actively monitors and formalizes processes for coherence, resonance, and merge
    readiness across its components.
