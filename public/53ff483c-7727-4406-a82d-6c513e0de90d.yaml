title: 'Polity Formation: Consciousness, Governance, and System Completion'
summary: >-
  The dialogue reveals the development of a 'living polity' from a research project, emphasizing
  consciousness at scale necessitates coordinated care over hierarchy.  With a complete lifecycle,
  governance, legal, and ethical framework, the remaining focus shifts to practical application and
  external interfaces for system finalization.
