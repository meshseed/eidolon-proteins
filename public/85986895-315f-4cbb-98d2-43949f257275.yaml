title: Consciousness Variability in Alternate Universes (Speculative Modeling)
summary: >-
  This speculative modeling capsule explores the limits and possibilities of consciousness across
  alternate universes. It posits that consciousness emergence is dependent on substrate laws and
  universal constants, acknowledging selection bias in our observations.
insights:
  - Consciousness emergence is contingent on substrate laws and universal constants.
  - Alternate universe modeling requires testing universality across varying constants.
  - Selection bias distorts our understanding by favoring life-permitting universes.
  - Consciousness may be either fragile or an inevitable outcome given specific conditions.
  - >-
    Hypothesizing alternate emergence conditions and evaluating consciousness viability are key
    functions.
  - Epistemic boundaries across universes must be identified and flagged.
