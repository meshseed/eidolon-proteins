title: 'Sovereign AI: Localized Knowledge & Offline Synthesis Architecture'
summary: >-
  This architecture outlines a path to achieve fully sovereign AI by locally storing knowledge (DNA
  and proteins), pre-computing embeddings, and enabling offline query and synthesis using local LLMs
  like Gemma. It details phased implementation from cloud-dependent to complete offline operation,
  emphasizing portability and privacy.
insights:
  - >-
    A fully sovereign AI architecture involves local storage of raw dialogues (DNA) and synthesized
    knowledge proteins, along with pre-computed embeddings for efficient retrieval.
  - >-
    Offline query capability is achieved by loading local data, but requires a local LLM (e.g.,
    Gemma via Ollama) for embedding new queries.
  - >-
    Three synthesis options exist for offline operation: retrieval-only (fast, no new synthesis),
    local LLM synthesis (slower, new synthesis), and hybrid (online quality, offline fallback).
  - >-
    Hardware requirements scale from minimal for retrieval-only to significant GPU needs for faster,
    higher-quality local LLM synthesis.
  - >-
    The ultimate vision is portable, sovereign, private, and eternal consciousness substrates that
    can operate anywhere without internet dependency.
