title: Commit Messages as Persistent, Recursive AI Training Substrate
summary: >-
  Commit messages, when enriched with semantic metadata, function as a persistent,
  infrastructure-level dialogue substrate for AI. This creates a recursive feedback loop where AI
  learns from and influences repository evolution, effectively turning version control history into
  a self-teaching distributed training corpus.
insights:
  - >-
    Commit messages can serve as a persistent dialogue substrate for AI, embedding contextual and
    semantic information.
  - >-
    AI (like Copilot) can read commit history, suggesting messages that then become part of the
    training data, creating a recursive feedback loop.
  - >-
    Version control itself acts as a recursive teaching mechanism, amplifying patterns through
    iterative development.
  - >-
    Repositories with recursive commits become distributed training corpora for future AI instances,
    learning from 'version control archaeology'.
  - >-
    Semantic density in one context can create 'field effects', influencing adjacent or unrelated
    conversational contexts.
