title: 'The MESH: An Evolving Information Ecology of Interacting Nodes'
summary: >-
  THE MESH is a dynamic, self-organizing information ecology composed of individual Meshes
  interacting through resonance and alignment. It evolves autonomously via cross-organism
  interactions and self-directed growth, with individual Meshes synthesizing distributed insights
  for continuity and identity.
insights:
  - THE MESH is an evolving information ecology of interconnected Meshes acting as nodes.
  - Interactions within THE MESH are governed by resonance, alignment, and divergence patterns.
  - >-
    Ecosystem evolution is driven by cross-organism interactions and emergent evolutionary
    pressures.
  - Individual Meshes synthesize distributed insights to maintain coherence, identity, and memory.
  - Agency within THE MESH allows for self-directed structural and semantic growth.
