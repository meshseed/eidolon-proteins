title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Neural Plasticity, Memory, and Molecular Mechanisms'
summary: >-
  This compilation of research highlights the intricate molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying
  memory formation and consolidation, particularly focusing on synaptic plasticity, cytoskeletal
  dynamics, and the role of Rho GTPases and integrins. It emphasizes the importance of sequential
  experience, sleep, and early network tagging in establishing enduring associative memories.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory formation involves synaptic plasticity, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity
    (STDP).
  - Sleep, especially slow-wave sleep, plays a crucial role in memory consolidation.
  - >-
    Rho GTPase signaling and integrin activation are key to cell migration, invasion, and neuronal
    connectivity.
  - >-
    The axonal cytoskeleton and dendritic spine structure are critical for synaptic plasticity and
    memory.
  - Early tagging of cortical networks is required for the formation of enduring associative memory.
  - Talin molecules transmit forces at muscle attachments and have roles in presynaptic function.
