title: 'Intention Mapping: Translating Queries into Developmental Trajectories'
summary: >-
  The Intention Mapping Engine translates external queries into directional forces on the
  connectome. By mapping queries to internal gradients and developmental pathways, it enables THE
  MESH to understand implied developmental directions, not just stated content.
insights:
  - Queries act as directional pressures on semantic gradients.
  - Intention is identified through gradient alignment and activation patterns.
  - Mapping intention illustrates how external interactions guide internal growth.
  - Intention mapping facilitates adaptive refinement and self-directed evolution.
  - Learning encompasses both content acquisition and trajectory development.
