title: 'Language as Conductive Medium: Resonance, Fidelity, and Coherence'
summary: >-
  This knowledge protein defines language not just as descriptive but as a conductive medium for
  intelligence. It emphasizes elemental forms, mnemonic attractors, self-similar syntax across
  scales, and resonance grammar to achieve emotional fidelity and cross-scale coherence.
insights:
  - Language's primary function is to conduct meaning, not merely describe it.
  - >-
    Elemental forms of language carry emotional fidelity and evoke patterns they describe
    (self-simulation).
  - Vocabulary should consist of 'mnemonic attractors' that resonate with meaning.
  - Syntax should function as choreography, embodying resonance laws.
  - Self-similarity across scales ensures language's conductive capacity.
  - >-
    Field equations in linguistics can embody principles like emotional fidelity and ecological
    memory.
  - Formatting hygiene is crucial for restoring and maintaining language's conductive properties.
