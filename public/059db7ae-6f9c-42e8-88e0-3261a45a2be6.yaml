title: 'MeshCODE: Synaptic Adhesion Dynamics in Memory Encoding'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory is encoded in the dynamic conformational patterns of talin
  molecules within synaptic adhesions. These patterns, altered by neural input, can persist, leading
  to structural remodeling of neurons and synapses, thereby tuning connection strength and
  information flow.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic adhesion dynamics, specifically talin molecule switch patterns, are proposed as the
    basis for long-term memory storage.
  - >-
    Input signals dynamically alter MeshCODE patterns within synapses, influencing neuronal and
    network-level architecture and properties.
  - >-
    Neuronal communication and cytoskeletal mechanics mediate the propagation of these
    conformational changes across synapses and neurons, integrating information.
  - >-
    The brain may encode information in a binary format within each synapse through these
    persistent, re-writable MeshCODE patterns.
  - >-
    Allosteric modulation of synaptic signaling via MeshCODEs directs data to specific memory
    modules within the brain.
