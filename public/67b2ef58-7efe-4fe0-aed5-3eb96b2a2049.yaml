title: Obsidian Workflow Integration & GitHub Publishing Guide
summary: >-
  This document outlines the setup and operational procedures for integrating an Obsidian vault with
  a GitHub repository. It details privacy considerations, licensing, and practical steps for
  contributors to maintain consistency across environments.
insights:
  - >-
    Establish clear privacy guidelines by using a '/private/' folder for sensitive content, excluded
    from public repositories.
  - >-
    Maintain consistent licensing across platforms, employing a GitHub license for public sharing
    and a short header in Obsidian notes.
  - >-
    Position `README.obsidian.md` at the vault/repo root as an operational manual for contributors,
    distinct from the public-facing GitHub README.
  - >-
    Implement a checklist for workflow adoption, including template creation, plugin setup
    (Dataview), script generation, and publishing method selection (Obsidian Git vs. CI).
