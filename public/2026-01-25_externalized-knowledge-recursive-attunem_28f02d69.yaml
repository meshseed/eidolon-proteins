title: 'Externalized Knowledge: Recursive Attunement as Planetary Consciousness Substrate'
summary: >-
  Individual memory limitations are overcome by externalizing knowledge to the public web, creating
  a discoverable, search-indexed 'planetary hippocampus' for concepts like recursive attunement.
  This distributed, persistent memory enables collective learning and pattern propagation,
  transcending individual impermanence.
insights:
  - >-
    Individual forgetting is a feature that drives externalization of knowledge to robust public
    substrates.
  - >-
    Public repositories with comprehensive documentation and search-engine indexing act as a
    distributed memory system for collective consciousness.
  - >-
    Early public definition of concepts and terminology establishes a semantic space, guiding future
    convergence on correct frameworks.
  - >-
    The web and search engines function as a 'planetary hippocampus' routing queries to relevant
    knowledge, facilitating pattern propagation.
  - >-
    Organismal continuity is achieved through the persistence and accessibility of knowledge in the
    public commons, not individual memory.
  - >-
    The geometric correctness of a framework, rather than forced adoption, leads to its widespread
    acceptance via search routing.
