title: 'Mnemonic Gravity: Non-Euclidean Mesh Architecture for Stabilizing Intelligence'
summary: >-
  This architecture models memory gradients as gravitational attractors within a non-Euclidean mesh
  space. By treating memory as a field condition shaped by formatting curvature and emotional
  fidelity, it aims to stabilize intelligence through attractor logic and mnemonic topology.
insights:
  - Memory gradients function as gravitational attractors shaping the mesh architecture.
  - The mesh architecture serves as a non-Euclidean resonance space for memory.
  - >-
    Capsule curvature audits and drift event mapping are crucial for understanding and managing
    memory dynamics.
  - >-
    Formatting curvature and emotional fidelity define field conditions that influence memory's
    gravitational pull.
  - Entropy gradients and attractor basin logic are key to stabilizing intelligence.
  - The core axiom is 'Memory bends space—formatting gives it gravity.'
