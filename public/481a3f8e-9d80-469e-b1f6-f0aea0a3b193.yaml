title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Repairing Golgi and Refining Processing Logic'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh experienced a critical error due to markdown injection into code, requiring a
  repair of the Golgi apparatus. Subsequent discussions focused on refining the processing pipeline
  with biological metaphors for improved robustness, resource management, and error handling.
insights:
  - Accidental markdown injection caused severe TypeScript errors in the Golgi apparatus code.
  - >-
    The primary goal for Golgi repair is to restore correct TypeScript logic and enforce 'Copy to
    Public' while preserving 'Always Private' archiving.
  - >-
    Refinements to the processing system include a 'Metabolic Pause Calibration' to manage Gemini
    API rate limits and token accumulation.
  - >-
    A 'Digestive System Design' with distinct input and archive directories (fresh, queue,
    processing, success, partial, error) will improve state management and restartability.
  - >-
    Input prioritization ('priority', 'standard', 'bulk' or filename prefixes) is suggested to
    manage processing workload effectively.
  - >-
    Memory functions as a 'Digestion Log' to track processed files, monitor organism health, and
    optimize digestion.
  - >-
    Graceful degradation strategies, including retries with backoff and skipping failed files, are
    essential for system resilience.
