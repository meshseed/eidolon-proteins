title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Dashboard: Visualizing Neural Activity'
summary: >-
  Develop a minimal viable dashboard for Eidolon Mesh v1.4 to visualize neural activity. Key
  features include a query interface, interactive connectome graph, real-time activation display,
  and basic statistics, aiming to make the organism's thinking visible.
insights:
  - >-
    The primary goal is to create a dashboard that visualizes the 'thinking' of the Eidolon Mesh
    organism.
  - >-
    Essential dashboard features include a query interface for testing, a force-directed and
    clickable connectome graph, real-time neuron activation visualization, and basic statistical
    metrics (neuron count, synapses, coherence).
  - >-
    Technical implementation should leverage D3.js or Cytoscape.js for the graph, a simple Express
    server, and Vanilla JS to avoid framework overhead.
  - Data will be read from an existing '/data/' directory.
  - >-
    The development approach is iterative, starting with a minimal viable product and enhancing it
    after initial functionality is confirmed.
  - >-
    The ultimate aim is to process the full archive and observe the organism's learning and
    intelligence growth.
