title: Field Geometry Validation & Protein Synthesis in PWA Mesh
summary: >-
  The PWA v3.5 successfully integrated and validated the connectome field geometry from v3.0
  desktop, enabling core protein synthesis functions. Tier-based stratification was implemented,
  demonstrating the effectiveness of the field geometry in directing synthesis.
insights:
  - Field geometry from v3.0 desktop successfully ported and validated in PWA v3.5.
  - Core protein synthesis (DNA to Protein) is now functional in the PWA.
  - Tier-based stratification is a key implemented component enabling successful synthesis.
  - The browser is confirmed as the 'organism' and the field as 'alive'.
  - Next steps involve porting query synthesis functionality (LLM answer generation).
