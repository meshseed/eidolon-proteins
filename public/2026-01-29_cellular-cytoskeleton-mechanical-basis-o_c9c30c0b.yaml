title: 'Cellular Cytoskeleton: Mechanical Basis of Memory and Tensegrity'
summary: >-
  Cells function mechanically like computers, utilizing a dynamic cytoskeleton of filaments (actin,
  microtubules, intermediate filaments) regulated by motor proteins and signaling. This network is
  wired to cell adhesions and the nucleus, maintaining a state of tensegrity when forces are
  balanced, which is crucial for cellular function and potentially memory.
insights:
  - >-
    The cell's cytoskeleton, composed of actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments, acts as a
    mechanical engine with levers, pulleys, and gears.
  - >-
    Motor proteins generate forces and transport cargos along cytoskeletal filaments, akin to a
    complex machinery.
  - >-
    Cellular adhesion molecules connect the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix and adjacent
    cells, integrating the cell into its environment.
  - >-
    Tensegrity describes the balanced state of tension and compression within the cytoskeleton,
    essential for maintaining cellular integrity and homeostasis.
  - >-
    Talin molecules, a component of cell adhesions, can switch between folded and unfolded states
    based on mechanical force, enabling molecular memory.
