title: Verifying MESH Organism Context Isolation and Clean Slate Testing
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a rigorous protocol to test if a MESH organism instance achieves true
  amnesia when context/history sources are disabled. It emphasizes verifying that information
  doesn't leak through caches, indexes, or session states, proposing a 'pure math' organism as the
  most reliable clean slate.
insights:
  - >-
    The core test is to verify if disabling an organism's context sources results in a genuine
    'clean slate' amnesia.
  - >-
    Potential information leakage points include embedding caches, index persistence, session state,
    and connectome persistence.
  - >-
    A robust test protocol involves checking memory before disabling context, then verifying amnesia
    with the same questions.
  - >-
    Introducing only 'pure math' proteins to a disabled organism is proposed as a reliable method to
    confirm a clean state, as it should only recognize math concepts.
  - >-
    Creating entirely separate organism instances for testing specific knowledge domains (e.g.,
    math-only) is more reliable than toggling features off.
  - >-
    A contaminated organism will recall MESH-specific information and context, while a clean one
    will exhibit generic AI responses and limited knowledge.
