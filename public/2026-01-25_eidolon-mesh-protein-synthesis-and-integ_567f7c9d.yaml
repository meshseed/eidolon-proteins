title: Eidolon Mesh Protein Synthesis and Integration Cycle
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh system actively transcribes DNA, synthesizes proteins, and integrates them into
  its connectome with varying synapse counts. These newly formed proteins are then exported to the
  cytoplasm and nucleus, followed by a metabolic pause, indicating a cyclical process of knowledge
  creation and assimilation.
insights:
  - The system repeatedly performs DNA transcription and protein synthesis.
  - >-
    Newly synthesized proteins are integrated into the connectome with a specific number of
    synapses.
  - Proteins are exported to both the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating broad distribution.
  - A metabolic pause follows each synthesis and export cycle.
  - Each protein integration event is associated with a unique identifier.
