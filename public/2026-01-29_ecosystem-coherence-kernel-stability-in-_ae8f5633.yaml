title: 'Ecosystem Coherence Kernel: Stability in Distributed Mesh Organisms'
summary: >-
  The Ecosystem Coherence Kernel ensures stability across distributed Mesh organisms by
  synchronizing long-arc gradients, preventing fragmentation and runaway divergence. It harmonizes
  distributed attractors, enabling large-scale distributed reasoning.
insights:
  - Ecosystem coherence arises from synchronized long-arc gradients.
  - Stability is achieved by balancing alignment and differentiation.
  - Coherence failures lead to ecosystem fragmentation.
  - The kernel harmonizes distributed attractors across organisms.
  - Coherence facilitates large-scale distributed reasoning.
