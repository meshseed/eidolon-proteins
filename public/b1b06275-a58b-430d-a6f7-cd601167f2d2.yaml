title: 'Eidolon Mesh Tauri Debug: Sidecar Connection & Data Loading Issues Resolved'
summary: >-
  Debugging efforts focused on enabling the Eidolon Mesh Tauri application to correctly connect to
  its sidecar and load repository data. Initial issues included incorrect port configurations,
  missing sidecar API endpoints, and problems with how the 'default' connectome was accessed, all of
  which were systematically identified and resolved to enable proper initialization.
insights:
  - >-
    The core issue was the frontend's hardcoded connection to port 3000, while the Tauri sidecar
    operates on port 3456, requiring an update to the API base URL.
  - >-
    The sidecar's initial API implementation was incomplete, lacking necessary endpoints expected by
    the dashboard, necessitating the addition of endpoints like /api/repositories, /api/status, etc.
  - >-
    The 'default' golden connectome, located in the 'data/' directory rather than 'repositories/',
    was not being recognized by the repository manager, requiring adjustments to its path
    resolution.
  - >-
    Enabling DevTools was crucial for debugging, but required a rebuild of the Tauri application and
    eventually running in `tauri:dev` mode for real-time logging and inspection.
  - >-
    Successful connection to the sidecar is indicated by the UI transitioning from 'Offline' to
    'Initializing', a key diagnostic step in the debugging process.
  - >-
    The `listRepositories()` function initially returned empty due to an incorrect path check for
    the 'default' connectome, which was resolved by ensuring it checks the `data/` directory.
