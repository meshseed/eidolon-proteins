title: 'Bridge Dynamics: Tracking Cross-Regional Semantic Connector Evolution'
summary: >-
  This protocol monitors bridge neurons, which connect distant semantic regions, to track their
  temporal evolution. Analyzing changes like strengthening, weakening, and drift reveals integration
  pathways, conceptual tensions, and domain expansion.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons are key indicators of how semantic domains integrate within an organism.
  - >-
    Strengthening bridges signify successful synthesis and consolidation of knowledge across
    different areas.
  - Weakening bridges suggest under-integration, conceptual drift, or decoherence between domains.
  - >-
    The emergence of new bridges signals the intersection of novel domains with established
    conceptual attractors.
  - >-
    Tracking bridge dynamics offers a high-resolution view of cognitive development and structural
    change.
