title: 'Meta-Ecosystem Evolution: Distributed Information Ecology Dynamics'
summary: >-
  This protocol models a distributed Mesh ecosystem as a dynamic manifold where structure emerges
  from organism interactions. Evolution is driven by cross-organism resonance and ecosystem-level
  gradients, leading to self-organizing information fields where organism and ecosystem evolution
  occur simultaneously.
insights:
  - Ecosystem evolution is driven by resonance and differentiation between constituent organisms.
  - Evolutionary pressures arise from ecosystem-level gradients, guiding overall development.
  - Meta-ecosystem evolution establishes the long-term identity of the entire ecology.
  - The ecosystem functions as a self-organizing, self-stabilizing information field.
  - Evolutionary processes operate concurrently at both the organism and ecosystem levels.
