title: Eidolon Mesh v3.6 Live, v4.0 Architecture Development & Hybrid Deployment Strategy
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh v3.6 with a 36-protein golden connectome is live on eidolon-mesh.net and publicly
  accessible. Development is split between Antigravity's v3.6 production deployment and the team's
  v4.0 architecture work, exploring advanced features like synapse regeneration and P-Series
  protocols. A hybrid deployment strategy is recommended, launching v3.6 to app.eidolon-mesh.net
  while v4.0 matures, with eventual migration planned.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh v3.6 is successfully deployed to eidolon-mesh.net, featuring a 36-protein golden
    connectome and is publicly accessible.
  - >-
    Two distinct development streams exist: Antigravity focusing on v3.6 production deployment and
    the core team developing v4.0 architecture with new protocols and features.
  - >-
    A hybrid deployment strategy is proposed: release v3.6 to app.eidolon-mesh.net immediately while
    continuing v4.0 development, followed by a future migration to v4.0.
  - >-
    Key v4.0 architectural explorations include P-Series protocols, topology, activation, and
    synapse regeneration, aiming to understand emergent organization.
  - >-
    Git coordination requires distinct domains for v3.5 PWA (Antigravity) and v4.0 (core team) with
    learnings shared through protocols and connectome proteins.
  - >-
    Synapse regeneration testing in v4.0 is crucial to validate P-Series hypotheses and determine
    readiness for public deployment.
