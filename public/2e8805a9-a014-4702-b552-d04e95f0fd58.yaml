title: 'Symmetry Groups: Transformations Preserving Structure'
summary: >-
  Symmetry is a transformation that leaves an object invariant, forming groups under composition
  governed by closure, associativity, identity, and inverses. Basic transformations like reflection,
  rotation, and translation, when combined, define the symmetry groups of geometric objects and find
  applications across science and art.
insights:
  - Symmetry transformations reveal underlying structural invariances.
  - The group axioms precisely define the behavior of all possible symmetries.
  - Composition of symmetries is generally non-commutative, meaning order matters.
  - >-
    Understanding symmetry groups is crucial for classifying structures in various scientific
    domains.
