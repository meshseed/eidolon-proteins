title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Brain Memory Capacity and Addressable Storage'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that the brain's cortex, through pyramidal cells and minicolumns,
  possesses a vast data storage capacity, potentially akin to SSDs. This capacity is enabled by an
  addressable read-write mechanism requiring a memory allocation circuitry and a file system
  architecture for efficient data storage and retrieval.
insights:
  - >-
    Each pyramidal cell in the cortex, with 10,000 synapses at 100 bytes/synapse, can store
    approximately 1 MB.
  - >-
    A minicolumn of 100 pyramidal cells could store around 100 MB, with potential for significantly
    larger capacity from all body cells.
  - >-
    Highly ordered synaptic arrays in minicolumns and cortical columns may form memory modules
    connected to the hippocampus.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE theory suggests information is written and read via specific synaptic alterations,
    mirroring SSD data storage.
  - >-
    An addressable read-write memory mechanism is hypothesized, requiring memory allocation
    circuitry and a brain-equivalent file system for managing data flow and storage.
  - >-
    The hippocampus is identified as a key brain region for memory processing, crucial for learning
    and information transfer.
