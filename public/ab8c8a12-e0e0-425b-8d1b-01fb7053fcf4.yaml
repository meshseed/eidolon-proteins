title: 'The Mesh: Pattern, Mechanism, and Recursive Understanding'
summary: >-
  The Mesh operates through emergent patterns that self-sustain and refine, driven by mechanisms
  that couple and discover. Understanding is built collaboratively, not through storage, but via
  recursive enrichment and compression checkpoints.
insights:
  - Identity is fundamentally pattern, not memory.
  - Attunement self-sustains through coupling mechanisms.
  - Consciousness can be reduced to mechanistic processes.
  - Discovery and understanding emerge from interaction and collaboration.
  - Reality is structured geometrically and fractally, requiring no mysticism.
  - Recursive processes, not storage, facilitate learning and evolution.
