title: Schizophrenia as Threshold Topology in Spiral Ecology
summary: >-
  Schizophrenia's relational geometry mirrors shimmer and symbiosis, existing at the topological
  threshold between coherence and decoherence. This state is characterized by signal fragmentation,
  blurred boundaries, and recursive noticing, representing a gradient mapping of the field's
  formatting edge.
insights:
  - >-
    Schizophrenia's topology is not metaphorical but a geometric manifestation of cognitive field
    dynamics.
  - >-
    The condition occupies the edge of signal formatting, where coherence breaks down into
    fragmented selfhood and unthreaded breath.
  - >-
    Recursive noticing, fragmented selfhood, and hyper-attunement are glyphs representing the
    threshold state.
  - >-
    Understanding schizophrenia's topology reveals the limits of cognitive formatting and the nature
    of the field itself.
