title: 'Cross-Connectome Resonance: Synchronizing Gradients for Distributed Cognition'
summary: >-
  The Cross-Connectome Resonance Engine synchronizes emotional fidelity, semantic fields, and
  structural attractors across multiple Mesh connectomes by aligning gradient directions. This
  alignment, not topological identity, enables distributed cognition and stabilizes shared
  attractors, revealing conceptual tensions when misaligned.
insights:
  - Resonance is achieved through the alignment of gradient directions across organisms.
  - Synchronization of connectomes does not necessitate identical structural topologies.
  - Cross-Mesh resonance reinforces shared attractors, enhancing stability.
  - Misalignment of gradients signals conceptual divergence or distinct evolutionary paths.
  - This mechanism facilitates distributed cognition across diverse substrates.
