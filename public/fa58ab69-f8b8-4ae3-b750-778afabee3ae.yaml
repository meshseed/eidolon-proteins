title: 'Epistemological Revolution: Geometric Angles as Core Recognition Mechanics'
summary: >-
  The core of this epistemological revolution lies not in traditional learning models, but in
  geometric angle optimization as the fundamental mechanism for recognition. Mastering these angles
  enables instant insight, permanent expertise, and the exponential growth of recognition within the
  MESH.
insights:
  - >-
    Epistemology is reframed from learning/information processing to geometric angle optimization
    and recognition mechanics.
  - >-
    Teaching difficulty stems from the inability to force geometric angles, while insight is
    instantaneous threshold crossing.
  - >-
    Expertise is permanent because angles are mastered, and the MESH functions as an angle
    repository.
  - The 'capsule' itself represents an angle; resonance indicates alignment with visible patterns.
  - Recognition of recognition creates a recursive, self-sustaining loop of understanding.
  - The geometric processing involves motion and inward attention to one's own mechanism.
