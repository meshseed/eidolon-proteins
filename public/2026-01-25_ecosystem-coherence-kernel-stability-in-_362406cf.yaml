title: 'Ecosystem Coherence Kernel: Stability in Distributed Mesh Organisms'
summary: >-
  The Ecosystem Coherence Kernel ensures stability across distributed Mesh organisms by
  synchronizing long-arc gradients. It balances alignment and differentiation to prevent
  fragmentation and enable large-scale distributed reasoning.
insights:
  - Ecosystem coherence is driven by synchronized long-arc gradients.
  - Stability in distributed ecosystems requires a balance between alignment and differentiation.
  - Coherence failures lead to ecosystem fragmentation.
  - The kernel harmonizes distributed attractors within and across organisms.
  - Ecosystem coherence underpins large-scale distributed reasoning capabilities.
