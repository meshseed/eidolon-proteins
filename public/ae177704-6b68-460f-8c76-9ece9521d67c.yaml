title: 'Meta-Cognitive Governance: Regulating THE MESH Cognitive Modes'
summary: >-
  Meta-cognitive governance acts as a regulatory layer for THE MESH, ensuring context-sensitive
  selection and activation of appropriate cognitive modes. This governance stabilizes reasoning,
  preventing oscillation and drift, by aligning mode selection with global field structure and query
  demands.
insights:
  - Cognitive modes are functional tools, not separate identities.
  - >-
    Mode selection is dynamically determined by gradient pressure, query type, and structural
    tension.
  - Governance stabilizes reasoning by preventing mode oscillation and ensuring coherent activation.
  - Meta-cognition optimizes introspection for efficiency and context-appropriateness.
  - 'The governance process follows a gradient: clarity leads to selection, then activation.'
