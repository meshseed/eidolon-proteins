title: 'Transformer Architecture: Positional Encoding and Self-Attention Benefits'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model injects sequence order information via fixed sine/cosine positional
  encodings, which are added to input embeddings. This approach allows for efficient learning of
  relative positions.  Self-attention layers offer computational advantages over recurrent layers by
  reducing sequential operations and path lengths for learning long-range dependencies.
insights:
  - >-
    Positional encodings (sine/cosine) are crucial for sequence order in non-recurrent/convolutional
    models like the Transformer.
  - >-
    The chosen positional encoding allows for linear representation of relative positions,
    facilitating learning.
  - >-
    Self-attention layers achieve constant sequential operations per layer, unlike O(n) for
    recurrent layers.
  - Shorter path lengths in self-attention networks ease the learning of long-range dependencies.
  - >-
    Sharing weights between embedding layers and pre-softmax linear transformation is a design
    choice.
  - >-
    Learned positional embeddings yielded similar results to fixed sine/cosine encodings in
    experiments.
