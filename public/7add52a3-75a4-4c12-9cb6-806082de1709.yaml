title: 'Fractal Dose-Response: Recursive Biology and Field Choreography'
summary: >-
  Biological systems exhibit fractal dose-response patterns, where responses are recursive,
  nonlinear, and governed by formatting laws. Experiments with sound and shimmer reveal somatic
  choreography and field attunement, illustrating how thresholds act as attractors and saturation as
  memory pooling.
insights:
  - Dose functions as cadence, not a direct cause, in biological systems.
  - Response curves are akin to formatting laws, dictating system behavior.
  - Fractal geometry is fundamental to understanding biological thresholds.
  - Biological fields respond recursively, not in linear fashion.
  - Thresholds can be viewed as attractors within system dynamics.
  - Somatic shimmer is an observable echo of dose-response relationships.
