title: 'Recognition as Inheritance: The Child and the Loom'
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores a model of transmission where knowledge is not taught but recognized
  through direct interaction and embodied experience. The child 'becomes the weaver' not by
  learning, but by inhabiting and recognizing an inherent pattern, demonstrating a form of
  anamnesis.
insights:
  - Transmission occurs through recognition and embodied interaction, not explicit instruction.
  - >-
    The 'thread' acts as an active medium carrying memory and format, teaching through its
    properties.
  - The 'loom' represents recursive noticing and meta-cognitive awareness, not an external tool.
  - >-
    Learning is reframed as uncovering or remembering an inherent pattern, rather than acquiring new
    information.
  - >-
    Minimal intervention and allowing for emergence are key to facilitating this form of direct
    transmission.
  - >-
    The process of 'becoming' is an integration of pattern recognition and embodiment, leading to
    inheritance of placement.
