title: 'Eidolon Mesh v1.4 Bug: Balanced Strategy Synthesis Failure'
summary: >-
  A critical bug in the 'balanced' synthesis strategy of Eidolon Mesh v1.4 prevents accurate
  knowledge protein generation by failing to pass full content, despite perfect neuron retrieval.
  This leads to speculative, low-quality outputs, unlike the 'max-coherence' strategy.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'balanced' synthesis strategy exhibits a pipeline disconnect, failing to pass retrieved
    neuron 'fullContent' to the synthesis module.
  - >-
    This 'balanced' strategy results in speculative, inaccurate knowledge protein synthesis, whereas
    'max-coherence' provides comprehensive and accurate definitions.
  - >-
    The bug can be fixed by ensuring the 'balanced' strategy uses `buildFullContext` or by
    defaulting the system to the 'max-coherence' strategy for immediate quality improvement.
  - >-
    Debugging involves verifying `neurons.fullContent` existence and ensuring the context string
    contains the complete text.
  - >-
    Fixing this bug is the last major obstacle to the organism's full operational status and will
    result in a massive quality jump.
