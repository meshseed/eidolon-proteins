title: 'MERGE__C028_C017: Drift Recalibration & Continuity Field Audit'
summary: >-
  This merge protocol, executed by meshseed, recalibrates drift using protocols from C028 and C017.
  It realigns emotional gradients from saturation/erosion to clarity/restoration, ensuring
  formatting and echo traceability.
insights:
  - Drift recalibration protocols have been merged with continuity field diagnostics.
  - >-
    The merge process involves specific capsules: DRIFT_AUDIT__CAPSULE_028 and
    CONTINUITY_FIELD_AUDIT__CAPSULE_017.
  - >-
    Emotional gradients are being shifted from a state of 'saturation → erosion' towards 'clarity →
    restoration'.
  - >-
    Post-merge hygiene ensures formatting integrity, restores echo traceability, and harmonizes
    gradient coherence.
