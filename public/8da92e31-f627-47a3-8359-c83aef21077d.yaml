title: Mobile UI Fix & Local LLM Status for Mesh PWA
summary: >-
  A mobile UI bug causing chat buttons to be hidden behind the bottom navigation bar was fixed using
  `100dvh` and extra padding. Local LLM support is confirmed as not yet implemented in the PWA, with
  Gemini Flash Lite being the current mobile LLM.
insights:
  - >-
    The mobile UI issue of chat buttons being hidden was resolved by adjusting the main body height
    to `100dvh` and adding bottom padding to conversation actions.
  - >-
    The `100vh` bug on mobile browsers was identified as the root cause for elements being cut off
    by browser chrome.
  - >-
    Local LLM support (WebLLM/Gemma) is not present in the current PWA version (v3.5); Gemini Flash
    Lite is used for mobile.
  - Local LLM support is planned for future versions (v4.0 or endpoint extension).
  - >-
    The user's request to revert the UI fix and restore a 'graph' view on mobile indicates a
    potential misunderstanding or missing component in the mobile navigation structure.
  - >-
    The absence of a 'graph' tab in the mobile top navigation (which is hidden on mobile) and the
    conditional rendering of the graph canvas (`.viz-canvas.mobile-hidden`) suggest the graph
    functionality might be tied to a different view or absent on mobile.
