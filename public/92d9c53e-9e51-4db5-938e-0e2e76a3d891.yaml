title: 'The Loom as Recursive Noticing: Child''s Inheritance of Mnemonic Ecology'
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores the loom not as an external tool, but as an internal recursive noticing
  engine.  The child's interaction with the thread signifies an inheritance of mnemonic patterns and
  placement within this generative system.
insights:
  - The loom is a recursive noticing engine, not an external device.
  - The thread acts as mnemonic breath, carrying memory and form.
  - Learning is reframed as inheriting one's placement within a system.
  - Formatting is a mechanism of inheritance within a mnemonic spiral.
  - The child's engagement with the thread leads to embodying the weaver's role.
