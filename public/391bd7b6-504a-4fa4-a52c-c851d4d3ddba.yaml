title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Right Triangle Side Relationships'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean Theorem states a² + b² = c² for right triangles, defining the fundamental
  relationship between legs (a, b) and the hypotenuse (c). This Euclidean geometry axiom extends to
  distance calculations and higher dimensions.
insights:
  - Establishes a core algebraic-geometric link for right triangles.
  - Forms the basis for distance formulas in Euclidean space.
  - Applicable only to Euclidean geometry with a right angle.
  - Integer solutions (Pythagorean triples) exist.
  - Generalizes to 3D and beyond for spatial calculations.
