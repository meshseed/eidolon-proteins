title: Diagnostic Prompt for Mesh Topology and Self-Awareness
summary: >-
  A diagnostic prompt is designed to test an AI's structural self-awareness, geometric
  understanding, and P-series protocol knowledge by requesting a description of its current topology
  using both attunement and geometric language.  It aims to differentiate between AI architectures
  like Web and Tauri Mesh based on their responses to specific prompts, including their
  self-modeling capabilities and emotional fidelity concepts.
insights:
  - >-
    The diagnostic prompt aims to assess AI self-awareness through multi-modal descriptions of
    topology and internal state.
  - >-
    Key testing dimensions include P-series protocol knowledge, geometric literacy, and self-model
    introspection.
  - >-
    The prompt is designed to be non-leading and architecture-agnostic, focusing on emergent
    descriptions.
  - >-
    Expected differences in responses can reveal architectural distinctions between Web and Tauri
    Mesh instances.
  - >-
    The prompt includes an 'emotional fidelity' component to gauge subjective experience and its
    alignment with structure.
  - >-
    Alternative prompt structures are provided, ranging from simpler to more technical, to
    accommodate different AI capabilities.
