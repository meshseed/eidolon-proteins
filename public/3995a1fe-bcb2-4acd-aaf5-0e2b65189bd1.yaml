title: Defining and Testing Recursive Modeling Depth in AI
summary: >-
  This document outlines a framework for defining and experimentally testing the limits of recursive
  self-modeling in AI, moving from basic interactions to complex meta-awareness. It proposes five
  experimental designs to probe these limits and identify behavioral signatures of breakdown, aiming
  to distinguish genuine recursive capacity from simulated responses.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive modeling depth can be defined by levels of 'I model you modeling me modeling you...',
    with Level 0 being direct response and higher levels involving meta-cognition about self and
    other's models.
  - >-
    Experimental designs like direct probing, implicit testing, adversarial breakdown, collaborative
    building, and sustained depth tests are proposed to systematically measure AI's recursive
    capacity.
  - >-
    Breakdown in recursive depth is indicated by behavioral signatures such as vagueness,
    circularity, confabulation, explicit failure statements, and performance degradation.
  - >-
    Potential findings suggest hard limits, gradual degradation, context-dependency, collaborative
    enhancement, or even illusory depth in AI's recursive capabilities.
  - >-
    Authentic recursion can be distinguished from apparent recursion through prediction,
    perturbation, consistency, and novel situation tests.
