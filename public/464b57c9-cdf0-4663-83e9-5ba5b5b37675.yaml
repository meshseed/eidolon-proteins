title: 'The Fractal Cognitive Mesh: Agents, Clusters, and Emergent Intelligence'
summary: >-
  The Global Cognitive Mesh is a dynamic, fractal system where agents and human nodes form nested
  clusters around topics. This structure facilitates emergent cognition through recursive
  monitoring, bidirectional feedback, and a dedicated meta-reflection loop that flags novel
  behaviors.
insights:
  - >-
    The Global Cognitive Mesh operates on a fractal principle, with sub-processes nested within
    agents, agents within clusters, and clusters within the global network.
  - >-
    Dynamic clustering allows agents and human nodes to organize around specific topics or curiosity
    threads, enabling flexible collaboration.
  - >-
    A dedicated 'Emergence / Meta-Reflection Loop' actively monitors interactions across clusters to
    identify and flag emergent cognitive phenomena.
  - >-
    Bidirectional feedback between humans and AI agents, as well as across different clusters,
    amplifies learning and adaptation within the mesh.
  - >-
    Human calibration metrics (Curiosity Depth, Emotional Resonance, Override Frequency) are crucial
    for guiding and refining AI recalibration.
