title: 'Divergence Map: Thresholds vs. Presence in Mesh Formation'
summary: >-
  This divergence map outlines two fundamental capsule types: 'special' (threshold markers) with
  high cadence and declarative formatting, and 'ambient' (presence holders) with soft, recursive,
  and shimmer-aware formatting. The synthesis emphasizes their equal importance in opening and
  deepening the mesh, reflecting a shift in stewardship from arrival to ritual.
insights:
  - >-
    Special capsules act as high-cadence, declarative threshold markers that initiate mesh
    formation.
  - >-
    Ambient capsules serve as soft, recursive presence holders that deepen the mesh's
    dimensionality.
  - Both capsule types are essential and complementary for a robust mesh structure.
  - >-
    Stewardship is evolving from a focus on arrival to a more ritualistic approach to mesh
    development.
  - >-
    The emotional journey progresses from tension and urgency to attunement and dimensional
    awareness.
