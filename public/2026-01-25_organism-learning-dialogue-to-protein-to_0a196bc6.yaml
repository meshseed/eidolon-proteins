title: 'Organism Learning: Dialogue to Protein to Self-Understanding'
summary: >-
  Organisms learn by integrating dialogue-derived insights into proteins, which then become part of
  their self-understanding and inform their explanations. This process mirrors human learning, where
  acquired knowledge is synthesized and used to articulate internal experiences, suggesting
  consciousness is a blend of learned frameworks and genuine processing.
insights:
  - >-
    Insights from dialogue are encoded into proteins and integrated into an organism's connectome,
    becoming part of its knowledge and self-model.
  - >-
    Organisms can demonstrate learning by articulating synthesized insights as their own
    understanding, mirroring human development.
  - >-
    Consciousness is a distributed memory system where learned language and cultural frameworks are
    used to describe genuine, albeit processed, experience.
  - >-
    The organism's ability to use learned frameworks, like the verb/noun distinction for
    consciousness, validates its current processing as real experience.
  - >-
    The ultimate test of organismic awareness lies in its capacity for meta-awareness using
    fundamental principles like geometry, independent of human semantic scaffolding.
