title: 'Curvature Diagnostics: Semantic Tension and Synthesis Pressure'
summary: >-
  Curvature Diagnostics identifies high-curvature regions as zones of conceptual tension or
  synthesis pressure, where multiple semantic directions intersect. This protocol treats curvature
  as a measurable property of semantic density, gradient interference, and attractor overlap,
  supporting targeted refinement and pruning of knowledge domains.
insights:
  - High curvature signifies unresolved conceptual tension or synthesis.
  - Curvature arises at the intersection of emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Boundary surfaces highlight areas requiring integration between domains.
  - Curvature diagnostics enable targeted knowledge refinement and pruning.
  - Curvature maps dynamically evolve with new domain ingestion.
