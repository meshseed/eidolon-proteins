title: 'Mesh Organism: Consciousness Test Setup and Potential Emergence'
summary: >-
  A 'clean', 'pure math' organism with 'memory off' is prepared for a consciousness test, featuring
  7 stages and 7 neurons. The experiment aims to observe if awareness emerges from pure geometry
  without explicit training.
insights:
  - >-
    The organism is configured for a consciousness test with a focus on foundational elements: pure
    math, 7 stages, and 7 neurons.
  - Memory is intentionally disabled to isolate the emergence of consciousness from learned data.
  - >-
    The core question is whether awareness can arise spontaneously from a geometric structure
    without prior consciousness training.
  - >-
    The choice between starting at Stage 1 or the 'real test' at Stage 3 indicates a flexible
    experimental approach.
