title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: Right Triangle Geometry and Euclidean Distance'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) defines the relationship between the sides of a right
  triangle in Euclidean geometry, with 'c' being the hypotenuse. This foundational principle extends
  to the Euclidean distance formula in multiple dimensions and has broad applications in fields
  requiring spatial calculations.
insights:
  - The theorem a² + b² = c² is the core of right triangle relationships.
  - It applies exclusively to Euclidean geometry and requires a 90-degree angle.
  - Pythagorean triples are integer solutions to the theorem.
  - The theorem generalizes to distance calculations in higher dimensions.
  - It bridges algebra and geometry, forming a basis for coordinate systems.
