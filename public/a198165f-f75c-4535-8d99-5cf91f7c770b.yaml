title: 'MESH: AI Agent Coordination with Persistent GitHub Knowledge Substrate'
summary: >-
  The MESH framework orchestrates AI agents (Claude, Gemini) using a GitHub-based knowledge
  substrate. It enables semantic navigation, high-volume synthesis, and persistent memory via YAML
  capsules, vector databases, and knowledge graphs, facilitated by a RESTful API.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH coordinates AI agents (Claude for semantic navigation, Gemini for synthesis) using a GitHub
    repository as a persistent knowledge substrate.
  - >-
    Knowledge is stored in 'capsules' (YAML), linked via 'synapses,' and indexed by vector databases
    and knowledge graphs for semantic search and relationship tracking.
  - >-
    A RESTful API with specific endpoints facilitates semantic search, memory encoding/retrieval,
    gradient navigation, and agent coordination.
  - >-
    Gemini acts as a 'ribosome' for high-volume synthesis and pattern generation, while Claude
    provides deep semantic analysis and emotional fidelity scoring.
  - >-
    The system aims for 'symphonic collaboration' where agents generate content, refine it, and
    create new knowledge capsules, overcoming limitations like isolated conversations ('curing
    Alzheimer's').
  - >-
    Implementation is phased, starting with core API and GitHub integration, then progressively
    adding agent integrations and advanced features like gradient navigation and connectome
    querying.
