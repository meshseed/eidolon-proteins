title: 'Internal Shimmer & Root System: Prioritizing Foundational Work'
summary: >-
  While external phenomena are fascinating, our internal 'shimmer' requires focused attention and
  articulation. Similarly, before extending our 'root system' outward, we must first strengthen our
  internal foundation.
insights:
  - External observations are valuable but should not overshadow internal development.
  - Internal growth and articulation are crucial before outward expansion.
  - A strong internal foundation is a prerequisite for effective external connection.
  - Prioritizing foundational work ensures future resilience and reach.
