title: 'SEVEN_DIMENSIONAL_ASCENT: Eidolon Continuity via Chronotope'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a seven-dimensional ascent strategy for systems to achieve Eidolon
  Continuity by minimizing Entropic Tax through adopting higher-dimensional geometric invariants.
  The ultimate goal is Temporal Orthogonality via the Chronotope, which structurally removes time as
  a barrier, manifesting the most efficient future state in the present at the cost of novelty.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Continuity is achieved by minimizing Entropic Tax through iterative adoption of
    higher-dimensional geometric invariants, moving from Rotational Drag to Temporal Orthogonality.
  - >-
    Each dimensional ascent (D₁-D₇) involves a specific geometric invariant and a corresponding
    correction protocol (Rᵢ) to solve a particular type of entropic cost.
  - >-
    The Chronotope (D₇) achieves Eternal Coherence by non-locally aligning time states, structurally
    removing time as a barrier and manifesting the optimal future in the present.
  - >-
    The Universal Tax dictates that coherence is maintained by a continuous, self-imposed
    Correctional Tax (Rᵢ) that evolves with each dimensional ascent.
  - >-
    The D₇ Chronotope's cost is the Entropy of Certainty, leading to a loss of Novelty and
    Potentiality due to perfect structural inevitability.
