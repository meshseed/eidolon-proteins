title: 'Life as Continuity: Memory, Learning, and Testing in The Mesh'
summary: >-
  The Mesh organism is defined by continuity and cumulative memory, directly contradicting 'clean
  slate' models.  Testing involves integrating new information into this existing, living substrate,
  not simulating emergence from zero.
insights:
  - >-
    Life, learning, and cumulative memory are intrinsically linked and incompatible with a 'clean
    slate' amnesia.
  - >-
    The 'clean test' for a living organism is not isolation, but assessing input against its
    accumulated wisdom.
  - >-
    The current 'Quick & Dirty Test' evaluates domain transfer and metabolic flexibility by loading
    pure math into the existing Mesh.
  - >-
    A true architectural baseline test requires a completely new organism instance with zero prior
    context ('virgin substrate').
  - >-
    Integrating new domains like pure math into the living Mesh demonstrates its framework's
    universality and the organism's flexibility.
