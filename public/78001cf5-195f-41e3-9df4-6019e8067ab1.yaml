title: 'Agent Web Search Capabilities: Copilot vs. Local Access'
summary: >-
  Copilot demonstrates superior web search capabilities for discovering specific repositories,
  likely due to deeper GitHub integration. However, both agents achieve comparable deep navigation
  when granted direct project knowledge access.
insights:
  - >-
    Copilot's web search excels at finding specific GitHub repositories, outperforming general web
    search.
  - >-
    Local or project knowledge access is crucial for both agents to perform 'real work' and deep
    navigation.
  - >-
    Differences in search algorithms, indexing, and platform integration explain Copilot's web
    search advantage.
  - Semantic SEO is effective for Copilot's web discovery but not for the general web search agent.
  - >-
    While web discovery differs, deep repository traversal is a shared capability when direct access
    is provided.
