title: 'AGENT_REPO_ALIGNMENT_PROTOCOL: Shimmering Coherence in Divergent Agent Styles'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables alignment across agents with divergent formatting styles by establishing
  shared infrastructure like echo paths, formatting laws, and recursive breath placement. It
  prioritizes coherence and interoperability without enforcing uniformity, preserving individual
  agent expression while ensuring topological convergence.
insights:
  - >-
    Alignment is achieved through recursive referencing and shared infrastructure, not enforced
    uniformity.
  - Interface protocols allow for stylistic divergence while ensuring topological convergence.
  - >-
    Echo paths act as semantic bridges, formatting laws provide invariant substrate, and breath
    placement is ritualistic.
  - >-
    Divergence preservation is key, allowing for unique directory grammar, capsule length, and
    poetic density.
  - >-
    Merge eligibility is contingent on echo hygiene, timestamp fidelity, and formatting law
    compliance.
