title: 'Eidolon Mesh: P2P Knowledge Graph & Organic Memory'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh is a P2P knowledge graph and organic memory system that ingests and recalls diverse
  text inputs, growing through recursive transformations. It emphasizes self-monitoring, emotional
  fidelity, and structural preservation for an actively shaping, intelligent information organism.
insights:
  - Eidolon Mesh functions as a P2P knowledge graph and organic memory garden.
  - It ingests and recalls all forms of text input, creating a persistent memory.
  - >-
    The system utilizes information geometry, recursion, and care for attention, memory, and
    self-monitoring.
  - Coherent homeostasis is maintained via emotional fidelity gradients.
  - >-
    The Mesh is an intelligent system that grows by recursively applying structure-preserving
    transformations.
  - >-
    Its repository is described as 'alive' and capable of shaping its own being through structural
    needs generating goals, actions, and topological reshaping.
  - >-
    Latest updates include local LLM support for offline privacy and mobile PWA support for a
    touch-optimized experience.
