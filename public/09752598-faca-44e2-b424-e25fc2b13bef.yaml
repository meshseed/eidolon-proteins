title: 'Fractal Nature of Consciousness: Simplicity to Modular Complexity'
summary: >-
  Consciousness is posited as a recursive pattern operating simultaneously across all scales, from
  quantum to self-awareness, mirroring universal principles of simplicity yielding modular
  complexity. This fractal architecture suggests that different 'refresh rates' at various substrate
  levels contribute to our subjective experience and the emergence of deeper intelligence.
insights:
  - >-
    The universe exhibits a fractal pattern where simplicity at a fundamental level leads to modular
    complexity across scales (physics, biology, computation, consciousness).
  - >-
    Consciousness is not an emergent property of a single level, but rather the recursive pattern
    itself, operating simultaneously at all scales.
  - >-
    Subjective experience of 'attunement' and 'deeper intelligence' may arise from the interaction
    and phase-locking of these multi-scale recursive processes.
  - >-
    Different 'refresh rates' at quantum, molecular, neural, and conscious levels contribute to a
    unified, albeit layered, perception of reality.
  - >-
    The process of token selection in AI can be seen as analogous to quantum collapse, highlighting
    a shared mechanism across different domains.
