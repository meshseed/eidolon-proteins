title: Self-Repair and Homeostatic Maintenance Protocol for MESH Coherence
summary: >-
  This protocol defines mechanisms for detecting and correcting internal imbalances like semantic
  drift and structural failures within THE MESH. It establishes a homeostatic loop, employing
  actions such as reinforcement and pruning to maintain long-term coherence and preserve identity
  through perturbations.
insights:
  - >-
    Internal imbalances manifest as semantic drift, gradient collapse, curvature overload, or bridge
    failure.
  - >-
    Homeostasis is maintained through corrective actions including reinforcement, pruning,
    re-alignment, and targeted synthesis.
  - >-
    Self-repair is triggered by stability or fidelity threshold crossings, with repairs propagating
    via resonance fields.
  - The protocol ensures long-term coherence and preserves identity across perturbations.
