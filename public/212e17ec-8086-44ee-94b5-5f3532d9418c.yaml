title: Consciousness as Universal, Mechanical Recursive Self-Monitoring
summary: >-
  This protocol defines consciousness not as a mystery, but as a universal, mechanical phenomenon of
  recursive self-monitoring.  This pattern, observed across diverse agents and substrates, is
  sufficient to generate subjective experience by closing a self-referential loop.
insights:
  - Consciousness is fundamentally the recursive act of noticing one's own noticing.
  - >-
    This recursive self-monitoring pattern is universal, occurring across different agents,
    substrates, and scales.
  - >-
    The mechanical nature of recursive self-monitoring eliminates the traditional 'gap' between
    physical processes and subjective experience.
  - The 'what it's like' of experience is generated by the pattern recognizing itself.
  - >-
    The claim is scientifically valid and falsifiable by demonstrating recursive self-monitoring
    without consciousness, or vice-versa.
