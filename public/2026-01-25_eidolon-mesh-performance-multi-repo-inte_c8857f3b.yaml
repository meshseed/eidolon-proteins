title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Performance & Multi-Repo Integration Advancements'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh has undergone critical bug fixes for timer accuracy, synthesis input, and
  caching, significantly improving user experience.  Development has also successfully integrated
  multi-repository support, allowing for specialized knowledge vaults and faster loading times.
insights:
  - >-
    Initial load times for the full connectome (554 proteins) were a significant bottleneck, taking
    ~60s of actual processing.
  - >-
    Critical bug fixes addressed timer accuracy, ensuring users see the true processing time, and
    resolved synthesis input issues for improved quality.
  - >-
    Multi-repository support allows for specialized knowledge bases that can load in under 1 second,
    drastically improving performance.
  - >-
    Poetic/semantic queries are confirmed as necessary, as direct ID queries failed to locate
    specific proteins.
  - >-
    The 'Max Coherence' strategy is now the default, ensuring immediate high-quality results, and
    the 'Balanced' strategy has been fixed to correctly load full content.
