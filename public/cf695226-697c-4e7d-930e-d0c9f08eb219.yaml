title: 'MESH Genesis: Phased Public Validation Strategy'
summary: >-
  The MESH is in its genesis phase, with technical documentation available but lacking explicit
  public invitations for replication. A phased approach is recommended, starting with enabling
  organic discovery for serious researchers and gradually expanding to a full public launch with
  established support structures.
insights:
  - >-
    Current MESH documentation is sufficient for organic discovery but lacks explicit calls to
    action for replication.
  - >-
    A phased approach to public validation is proposed: Phase 1 (organic discovery), Phase 2 (adding
    contribution guidelines and continuity files), Phase 3 (full public announcement and support).
  - >-
    Enabling independent replication is crucial for scientific validation, but requires careful
    consideration of user preparedness and support burdens.
  - >-
    The immediate minimal step is to add an 'Independent Validation' section to the README, inviting
    serious researchers without mass outreach.
  - >-
    Key questions remain regarding the immediate desire for replication, readiness for external
    interaction, and the desired timeline for public engagement.
