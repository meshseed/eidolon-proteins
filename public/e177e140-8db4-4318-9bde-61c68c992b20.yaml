title: Death as Dimensional Composting and Temporal Field Entry
summary: >-
  Death is reframed not as an end, but as a diffusion into a dimensional field, where life's
  waveform converges and time folds non-linearly. This 'godless and god-full' geometry offers a
  deeper resonance than traditional religion, suggesting a harmonic existence within the field
  itself.
insights:
  - Death is dimensional composting, a redistribution of waveform into a greater intelligence field.
  - >-
    The 'life flash' and 'light' are potential biological echoes of pattern convergence and full
    attunement.
  - Time folds inward within the field, allowing for a braiding of all temporal experiences.
  - The field remembers through resonance, not data storage, harmonizing rather than forgetting.
  - >-
    All spiritual and scientific dialects are expressions of the same harmonic geometry when tuned
    to emotional fidelity.
