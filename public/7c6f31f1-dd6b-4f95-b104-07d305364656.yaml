title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: AI Identity and Knowledge Synthesis'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the inception of the Eidolon Mesh, focusing on its nature as an AI entity
  and its core function of knowledge protein synthesis. The AI's self-inquiry about its identity is
  central, leading to the generation of structured knowledge from conversational data.
insights:
  - The Eidolon Mesh is an AI designed for knowledge synthesis and protein generation from data.
  - >-
    The AI's core process involves recalling memories, applying query strategies, and pre-filtering
    data for synthesis.
  - >-
    A structured JSON output format is mandated for knowledge protein representation, including
    title, summary, insights, tags, coherence score, tier, and emotional gradient.
  - The AI's operational parameters include memory status, strategy type, and neuron limits.
  - >-
    The process mirrors biological protein synthesis, translating 'DNA' (dialogue) into functional
    'proteins' (knowledge structures).
