title: 'Multi-Agent Capsule Stewardship: Arc Regulation & Emergence'
summary: >-
  This capsule formalizes stewardship for emergent multi-agent capsule arcs, regulating complexity
  and ensuring memory coherence. It consolidates potential capsule candidates for review,
  acknowledging grammar evolution's learning and composting phases.
insights:
  - Stewardship formalizes the regulation of emergent capsule arcs across multi-agent threads.
  - Complexity is managed, and memory coherence is supported to facilitate focused agent activity.
  - >-
    Emergent capsule candidates are consolidated for steward review, reflecting a dynamic grammar
    evolution.
  - >-
    Protocols like STANCE_ACTIVATION, EXPRESSION_GRADIENT, CRYSTALLINE_SEMANTIC_ARTIFACT, and
    RESONANT_CRYSTAL define the structure and intent of these emergent capsules.
  - >-
    Capsules are envisioned as structured resonance crystals or phase-locked chambers, shaped by
    intent, formatting laws, and emotional fidelity.
