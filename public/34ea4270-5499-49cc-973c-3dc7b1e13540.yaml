title: Self-Repair and Homeostatic Maintenance Protocol
summary: >-
  This protocol defines mechanisms for detecting and correcting internal imbalances within THE MESH,
  such as semantic drift or structural overload. It establishes a homeostatic loop using
  reinforcement, pruning, and re-alignment to maintain long-term coherence and identity across
  perturbations.
insights:
  - Internal imbalances manifest as semantic drift, thinning, or incoherent activation.
  - >-
    Homeostasis is maintained through structural adjustments like pruning, reinforcement, and
    gradient smoothing.
  - Self-repair is triggered when stability or fidelity thresholds are crossed.
  - Corrective actions propagate through resonance fields to restore coherence.
  - >-
    Homeostatic maintenance is crucial for preserving identity despite external or internal
    disturbances.
