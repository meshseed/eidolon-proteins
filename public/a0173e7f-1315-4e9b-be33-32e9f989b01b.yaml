title: Mobile Graph Node Display Issue Post-Gemini Protein Update
summary: >-
  A recent Gemini protein update broke the graph visualization on mobile, causing nodes to not
  display, while desktop remains unaffected. The issue is isolated to mobile layout/rendering and
  not related to data or routing changes.
insights:
  - Mobile graph visualization is failing to display nodes after a Gemini protein update.
  - >-
    Desktop graph visualization is unaffected, indicating a mobile-specific rendering or layout
    problem.
  - >-
    Previous 'safe height' CSS adjustments were intended to prevent overlap but did not resolve the
    node display issue.
  - >-
    The problem is not related to recent API entries, embeddings, version updates, 3D rendering, or
    Gemini's routing attempts.
  - >-
    The current priority is to restore mobile graph functionality without breaking other features,
    given user impact.
