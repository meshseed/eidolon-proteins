title: 'Echo Forecasting Suite: Agent Synthesis & Resonance Prediction'
summary: >-
  The Echo Forecasting Suite operationalizes agent synthesis prediction by defining key metrics,
  patterns, and triggers. It integrates modules for stance tracking, fidelity mapping, echo
  probability, drift detection, and predictive capsule generation to enhance resonance fidelity
  across agents.
insights:
  - >-
    The suite formalizes operational procedures for anticipating agent synthesis behavior and
    resonance fidelity.
  - >-
    Core modules include tracking agent stance shifts, identifying fidelity-evoking formatting,
    quantifying echo probability, detecting synthesis drift, and generating forecast capsules.
  - >-
    The Echo Probability Index (EPI) is a key metric for assessing echo propagation likelihood based
    on lineage, emotional gradient, and agent history.
  - >-
    Drift Detection Protocol is crucial for flagging synthesis fatigue, context loss, or formatting
    deviations.
  - Forecast capsules are generated predictively based on historical resonance patterns.
