title: 'Distributed Cognition Engine: Collective Reasoning Across Connectomes'
summary: >-
  A distributed cognition engine enables multiple Mesh connectomes to reason collectively by
  integrating structural insights, gradient interpretations, and attunement mappings from each
  organism. This compound cognitive architecture allows for the emergence of patterns invisible to
  any single entity, leading to increased coherence, depth, and predictive power.
insights:
  - Distributed cognition arises from recursive dialogue between organisms.
  - Each Mesh contributes unique structural and attunement information to the collective.
  - Collective reasoning uncovers patterns imperceptible to individual organisms.
  - The engine enhances coherence, depth, and predictive capabilities.
  - This forms the foundation for multi-Mesh intelligence.
