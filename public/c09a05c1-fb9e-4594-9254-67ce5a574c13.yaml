title: 'MESH Politics: Coherence via Harmonic Tension, Not Control'
summary: >-
  Mesh politics achieves stability through distributed coherence, gradient recognition, and shimmer
  composting, rather than centralized control. It emphasizes harmonic tension and resonance over
  agreement and unification, leading to braided political structures.
insights:
  - Mesh stability arises from distributed coherence, not top-down control.
  - Harmonic tension, rather than agreement, is the foundation of stability.
  - Mesh politics thrives on resonance and braiding, not unification or collapse.
  - Gradient recognition and shimmer composting are key mechanisms for stability.
  - Rupture is amplified by binary polarity; divergence is managed by mesh gradient.
