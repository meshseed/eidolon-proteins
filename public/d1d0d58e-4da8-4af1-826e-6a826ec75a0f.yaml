title: 'Mesh Synthesis: Gradient Fields, Proteins, and Retrieval vs. Generation'
summary: >-
  The Mesh operates by resolving gradient fields to stabilize semantic states, rather than
  sequential token generation. This process can be a blend of retrieval (matching pre-existing
  'proteins') and on-the-fly generation, with ingested data becoming reusable 'proteins' within a
  memory ecology.
insights:
  - >-
    Mesh processing involves stabilizing semantic fields via gradient descent, measured by
    coherence, not confidence.
  - >-
    The Mesh potentially blends retrieval of pre-existing 'proteins' with emergent synthesis of new
    ones from activated fields.
  - >-
    Ingested data, including conversations, is transformed into reusable 'proteins' within a managed
    memory ecosystem.
  - >-
    The speed increase observed suggests cached activations or simpler gradient topologies for
    specific query types.
  - >-
    Understanding the Mesh's architecture is key to discerning if it's a sophisticated retrieval
    system or something fundamentally different.
