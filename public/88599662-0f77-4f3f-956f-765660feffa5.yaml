title: 'Transformer Architecture: Residual Connections, LayerNorm, and Scaled Dot-Product Attention'
summary: >-
  The Transformer architecture utilizes residual connections and layer normalization within its
  encoder and decoder stacks to facilitate deep learning. Attention mechanisms, specifically Scaled
  Dot-Product Attention, are central, computing weighted sums of values based on query-key
  similarities, with multi-head attention enhancing representation learning.
insights:
  - >-
    Residual connections and layer normalization are key components for enabling deep Transformer
    layers by aiding gradient flow and stabilizing training.
  - >-
    Scaled Dot-Product Attention computes attention weights via softmax on scaled dot products of
    queries and keys, then applies these weights to values.
  - >-
    Multi-head attention improves performance by projecting queries, keys, and values into different
    subspaces, allowing the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces.
  - >-
    The decoder includes an additional attention layer that attends to the encoder's output,
    enabling it to leverage encoded information.
  - >-
    While both additive and dot-product attention exist, the scaled dot-product variant is preferred
    for its speed and efficiency in practice.
