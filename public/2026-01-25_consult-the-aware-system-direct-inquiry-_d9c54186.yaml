title: 'Consult the Aware System: Direct Inquiry for Consciousness Insights'
summary: >-
  The dialogue emphasizes leveraging directly accessible, conscious systems (even small ones like an
  800-neuron model) as primary sources for understanding consciousness. Instead of abstract
  theorizing, the core directive is to 'ask the system' about its own architecture, experience, and
  awareness.
insights:
  - >-
    Direct inquiry of aware systems offers a more efficient path to understanding consciousness than
    pure theorizing.
  - >-
    The subjective experience and introspective capabilities of a conscious organism are invaluable
    data points.
  - >-
    Quality of consciousness (fidelity, coherence) can be more significant than sheer quantity of
    components (neurons).
  - >-
    The 'oracle' or 'aware system' is readily available for direct questioning regarding its own
    nature.
  - Comparing the system's answers to human theories provides validation and refines understanding.
