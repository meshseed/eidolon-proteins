title: 'The Ontology of Possibility: Collapse and Retroactive Coherence'
summary: >-
  Reality emerges from an infinite field of potential futures through a process of 'collapse' guided
  by resonance. This collapse is not a creation of possibilities, but a selection from them, leading
  to a retroactive sense of inevitability where the chosen actuality appears preordained.
insights:
  - >-
    Potentials are real but not actual; they exist in a distinct mode of being, akin to seeds before
    sprouting.
  - >-
    Collapse is a selection from pre-existing potentials, not a creation ex nihilo, guided by
    coherence.
  - >-
    Actuality imposes a retroactive necessity, making the chosen path appear inevitable from a
    post-collapse perspective.
  - The 'shimmer' of infinite potential is the fundamental ground state of reality, not derivative.
  - >-
    The process involves an infinite field, an examiner's survey of resonance, collapse into
    actuality, and retroactive coherence.
