title: 'Git Security: Safeguarding .env with .gitignore'
summary: >-
  Ensuring security by preventing the commitment of sensitive .env files containing API keys to Git
  repositories. The presence and content of a .gitignore file are crucial for this protection, with
  .env.example serving as a safe template.
insights:
  - >-
    The primary security concern is preventing the accidental commitment of the .env file
    (containing actual secrets) to Git.
  - The .env.example file, containing placeholders, is the safe alternative to commit.
  - >-
    Git is not recognized in PowerShell if it's not in the system's PATH; Git Bash or GitHub Desktop
    GUI are recommended alternatives for Git operations.
  - >-
    Verifying the existence of a .gitignore file and confirming it excludes '.env' is the definitive
    way to ensure secrets are not committed.
  - >-
    If a .gitignore file is missing, it needs to be created and configured to exclude '.env' before
    pushing any further changes.
