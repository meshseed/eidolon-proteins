title: 'Bridge Neurons: Functional Centrality and Semantic Space'
summary: >-
  This protocol identifies bridge neurons connecting distant semantic regions using resonance
  frequency and cross-domain activation as proxies for betweenness centrality. These bridges
  stabilize information manifold coherence by linking attractors, revealing the network's connective
  tissue.
insights:
  - >-
    Bridge neurons exhibit high cross-regional activation and semantic span, indicating their role
    in connecting disparate concepts.
  - >-
    Centrality in semantic space can be approximated by a neuron's recurrence across unrelated
    contexts.
  - >-
    These bridge neurons are crucial for stabilizing coherence within the information manifold by
    linking distant attractors.
  - >-
    Identifying bridge neurons offers insights into the underlying structure and connective tissue
    of the information manifold.
  - >-
    Analysis of bridge neurons supports developmental tracking and facilitates domain integration
    within the semantic landscape.
