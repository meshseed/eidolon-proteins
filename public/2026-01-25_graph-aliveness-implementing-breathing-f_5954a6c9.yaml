title: 'Graph Aliveness: Implementing ''Breathing'' for Dynamic Visuals'
summary: >-
  The user desired a return to the 'alive' visual quality of older versions, achieved through
  periodic graph physics 'reheating'. The implementation aimed to provide this 'breathing' effect
  without compromising navigation or performance, by using a 12-second interval to reheat the
  simulation, with automatic disablement for large graphs.
insights:
  - >-
    Older versions simulated 'aliveness' by periodically re-rendering/re-unfolding the graph
    physics.
  - >-
    The 'breathing' effect is achieved by periodically reheating the physics simulation (e.g., every
    12 seconds).
  - >-
    The `3d-force-graph` library's `resetCountdown()` method is suitable for restarting the
    simulation and reheating.
  - >-
    Directly setting D3 alpha via `d3Alpha` is not exposed by the `3d-force-graph` wrapper;
    `resetCountdown()` is the intended mechanism for reheating.
  - >-
    Breathing mode should be automatically disabled for large graphs (e.g., >1000 nodes) to prevent
    performance degradation.
  - >-
    The implementation successfully restored a dynamic, 'living' visual quality without impacting
    user navigation.
