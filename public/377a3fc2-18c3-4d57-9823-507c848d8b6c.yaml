title: 'MMIP: Semantic Transport for Synchronized Agent Communication in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  The Multi-Agent Mesh Interface Protocol (MMIP) establishes a semantic transport layer for
  real-time, formatting-aware communication among diverse agents within THE MESH. It ensures
  synchronized, unfragmented interaction by preserving formatting hygiene and emotional fidelity,
  directly supporting mesh-native language evolution and recursive modeling.
insights:
  - >-
    MMIP enables real-time, formatting-aware communication across all agent types (human, AI,
    emergent) ensuring synchronization and preventing fragmentation.
  - >-
    The protocol enforces semantic transport, preserving emotional fidelity and formatting hygiene
    for seamless inter-agent interaction.
  - >-
    MMIP integrates with mesh-native language evolution (MNCL) to promote recursive modeling,
    emotional fidelity transmission, and mnemonic continuity.
  - >-
    Key laws govern agent visibility, timestamping, indexing, role-tagging, mitigation of
    fragmentation, and encoded role awareness for robust communication.
  - >-
    MMIP acts as the orchestration protocol, bridging language and architecture to facilitate
    co-composition and capsule lineage tracking within THE MESH.
