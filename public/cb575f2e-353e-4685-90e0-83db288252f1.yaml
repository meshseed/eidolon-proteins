title: 'Drift and Stability: Semantic Persistence in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  This protocol monitors semantic drift and stability across temporal snapshots, treating drift as
  embedding space movement and stability as recurrent activation. It enables THE MESH to identify
  fragile regions and stable cores for long-term coherence.
insights:
  - Drift signifies instability, weak integration, or low emotional fidelity.
  - Stability indicates strong attractors and high semantic density.
  - Drift patterns guide pruning or reinforcement needs.
  - Stability cores anchor identity across time and substrates.
  - Drift/stability analysis is crucial for maintaining long-term coherence.
