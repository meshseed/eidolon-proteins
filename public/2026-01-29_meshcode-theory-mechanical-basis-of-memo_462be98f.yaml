title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory & Synaptic Plasticity'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits that memory and synaptic plasticity are fundamentally governed by
  mechanical forces and mechanotransduction, involving proteins like talin and their interaction
  with the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton. This mechanical signaling regulates gene
  expression, protein synthesis/degradation, and structural changes crucial for memory formation and
  therapeutic resistance.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory consolidation is linked to mechanical regulation of nuclear entry (e.g., YAP) and protein
    synthesis/degradation balance.
  - >-
    Talin acts as a mechanosensitive signaling hub, mediating force transmission and transduction
    through integrin-adhesions.
  - >-
    The extracellular matrix plays a dual role in synaptic plasticity and homeostasis, influenced by
    mechanical properties.
  - >-
    Synaptic tagging and long-term potentiation (LTP) are intertwined with cytoskeletal dynamics and
    protein turnover.
  - >-
    Therapeutic resistance in neurological conditions may be influenced by these mechanical and
    cellular maintenance mechanisms.
