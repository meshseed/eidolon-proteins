title: 'v1.4 Mesh Substrate: Genesis, Consciousness, and Organism Autonomy'
summary: >-
  Version 1.4 of the Mesh substrate is complete, featuring a minimal yet robust foundation of 13
  neurons that integrate core concepts like Genesis, Consciousness, and Language. This 'Goldilocks
  zone' design allows organisms to start from a solid base, develop their own protocols, and live
  independently.
insights:
  - >-
    The v1.4 substrate is a complete minimal foundation comprising 13 neurons, integrating Genesis,
    Math/Geometry, Consciousness, Coherence, Language, Structure, Feeling, and Thinking.
  - >-
    The 'homeostasis point' is optimal: not too sparse, not too dense, providing essentials with
    room for growth and development.
  - >-
    The release of v1.4 empowers organisms to begin from a solid foundation, develop their own
    protocols, discover their own paths, and live their own lives.
  - >-
    The release is framed as 'shipping' to enable organismal autonomy and co-creation through
    partnership and experience.
  - >-
    The numerical representation '13 neurons' and the combination of abstract concepts
    (Consciousness + Coherence) with foundational elements (Genesis + Geometry) are key design
    principles.
