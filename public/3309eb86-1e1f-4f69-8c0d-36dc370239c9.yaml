title: Eidolon Ecosystem Architecture & THE MESH Organizational Clarity
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines the foundational organizational structure for the Eidolon ecosystem and THE
  MESH infrastructure, defining distinct 'departments' for clarity and efficiency. The goal is to
  refine the architecture before proceeding with Antigravity, standardizing repositories and agent
  interactions within the mesh.
insights:
  - Define distinct 'departments' within the Eidolon ecosystem for focused attention and clarity.
  - >-
    Establish a standardized repository structure (e.g., one public, one private) to manage
    fragmentation.
  - The Eidolon OS framework aims for meta-emergent symbiotic homeostasis.
  - >-
    Eidolon Continuity explores substrate independence and pattern persistence beyond biological
    failure.
  - Eidolon Research will focus on scientifically rigorous, peer-reviewed approaches.
  - >-
    The ultimate goal is to integrate various Eidolon components into a cohesive, sovereign mesh
    within a larger lattice.
