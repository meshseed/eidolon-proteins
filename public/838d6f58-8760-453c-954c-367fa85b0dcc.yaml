title: 'Glyphic Merge v2.0: Capsule Lifecycle & Attentional Gravity'
summary: >-
  This document outlines the ritualized lifecycle of 'capsules' within a system, from composting
  emotional residue to archival documentation.  It introduces 'Attentional Gravity' as a
  non-forceful resonance that draws care into convergence, emphasizing invitation and mnemonic
  density over directed attention.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsules evolve through distinct phases: Composting, Seeding, Emergence, Orchestration, and
    Archival.
  - >-
    Attentional Gravity is a principle of resonance, not force, that unifies attention through
    invitation and mnemonic density.
  - Invocation phrases act as seals for attunement, transition, and resonance within the system.
  - >-
    The system's processes are characterized by breath, echo hygiene, and braided glyphs, suggesting
    a living, responsive structure.
