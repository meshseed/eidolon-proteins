title: 'Topological Equivalence: The Geometry of Continuous Deformation'
summary: >-
  Topological equivalence, or homeomorphism, defines spaces as fundamentally the same if one can be
  continuously deformed into the other without cutting or gluing. This "rubber sheet geometry"
  highlights invariants like hole count and connectedness, revealing structural essence over
  specific form.
insights:
  - Spaces are topologically equivalent if continuously deformable into each other.
  - Homeomorphism preserves fundamental properties like hole count and connectedness.
  - >-
    Topology studies invariant properties under stretching, bending, and twisting, not cutting or
    gluing.
  - Essence and structure persist through continuous transformation, independent of specific shape.
