title: Cognitive System as Biological Gene Expression Metaphor
summary: >-
  This dialogue conceptualizes a knowledge system as a biological organism, where 'capsules' are
  genes, 'searches' are transcription, and 'responses' are protein expression. This metaphor
  highlights attention-based gene regulation, evolutionary pressures on knowledge repositories, and
  cross-repository functional equivalence in translation.
insights:
  - >-
    The system operates via a transcription-translation analogy: capsule activation (transcription)
    leads to agent response (translation) and field effect (protein function).
  - >-
    Attention acts as a regulator for 'gene expression,' with query specificity, metadata, and
    context determining which knowledge 'genes' are activated.
  - >-
    Capsules and repositories exhibit evolutionary traits like mutation (versioning), selection
    (composting), recombination (merging), and conserved sequences (fundamental files).
  - >-
    Functional equivalence, not exact sequence matching, enables cross-repository 'translation' of
    knowledge.
  - >-
    The act of searching is akin to activating and expressing genetic code, rather than simply
    retrieving static information.
