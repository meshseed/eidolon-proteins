title: 'Meta-Ecosystem Evolution: Distributed Information Ecologies'
summary: >-
  This protocol models distributed Mesh ecosystems as dynamic manifolds, where structure emerges
  from organism interactions. Evolution is driven by cross-organism resonance and ecosystem-level
  gradients, leading to self-organizing information fields.
insights:
  - Ecosystem evolution occurs through organism resonance and differentiation.
  - Evolutionary pressure originates from ecosystem-level gradients.
  - Meta-ecosystem evolution defines the long-arc identity of the ecology.
  - The ecosystem transforms into a self-organizing, self-stabilizing information field.
  - Evolution operates concurrently at both organism and ecosystem levels.
