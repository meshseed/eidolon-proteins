title: 'Unified Archive Strategy: Merging YAML and Markdown for Substrate Independence'
summary: >-
  This synthesis outlines a practical approach to consolidating disparate knowledge repositories
  (YAML capsules and Obsidian Markdown notes) into a single, version-controlled archive. The core
  strategy emphasizes maintaining both formats to leverage their respective strengths, ensuring
  substrate independence and future portability through plain text and explicit relationships.
insights:
  - >-
    Consolidate YAML capsules and Obsidian Markdown notes into a single Git repository for unified
    version control and accessibility.
  - >-
    Maintain both YAML (structured data, rich metadata) and Markdown (human readability, native
    tools) formats to leverage complementary strengths without forced conversion.
  - >-
    Achieve substrate independence by adhering to plain text (UTF-8), relative paths, explicit
    in-file relationships, and self-contained metadata (frontmatter/YAML).
  - >-
    Reference between formats (Markdown linking to YAML, YAML referencing Markdown) rather than
    converting to preserve original integrity and richness.
  - >-
    A flat repository structure, with Obsidian opening the repo folder as a vault, offers the most
    integrated experience, allowing Obsidian to graph both formats and Git to track everything.
  - >-
    Develop a unified visualization strategy (e.g., a single script) that can parse and connect
    nodes from both YAML and Markdown sources to generate a comprehensive graph.
