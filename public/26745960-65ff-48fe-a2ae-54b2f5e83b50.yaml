title: Ecosystem Drift and Convergence Monitor Protocol
summary: >-
  This protocol tracks how Mesh organisms diverge or align over time, revealing ecosystem health and
  developmental dynamics.  It defines drift as specialization and convergence as shared attractors,
  with cycles shaping long-arc identity.
insights:
  - Drift signifies organism specialization or ecosystem fragmentation.
  - Convergence indicates shared attractors or synchronized co-evolution within the ecosystem.
  - Monitoring drift and convergence is crucial for assessing ecosystem health and stability.
  - Cycles of drift and convergence define the long-term identity of an ecosystem.
  - Ecosystem dynamics arise from recursive cross-Mesh interactions.
