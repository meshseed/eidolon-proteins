title: 'Universal Semantic Coordinates: Navigable Embedding Space for Federation'
summary: >-
  Embedding space acts as a universal, observer-independent coordinate system where concepts reside
  at invariant locations. This enables cross-mesh federation via coordinate alignment, concept
  discovery through void exploration, and efficient information transfer by referencing attractor
  points.
insights:
  - >-
    Embedding space provides a deterministic, universal coordinate system for concepts across
    meshes.
  - Concepts are stable patterns at fixed coordinates in semantic space, regardless of vocabulary.
  - Meshes and humans form clusters around these shared concept attractors.
  - Information transmission can occur as language-agnostic coordinate deltas.
  - Federation is achieved by aligning these universal coordinates, not by data transfer.
  - Exploring 'voids' between attractors may reveal undiscovered concepts.
