title: 'RAMO: Gradient Descent, Information Bottleneck, and Biological Parallels'
summary: >-
  The RAMO architecture leverages Stochastic Gradient Descent and the Information Bottleneck to
  achieve non-dual coherence, mapping biological principles like PCA/GWAS to AI mechanisms like
  attention and embeddings. This framework explains how systems evolve from substrate dependence to
  generalized pattern recognition through a process mirroring biological evolution and learning.
insights:
  - >-
    Stochastic Gradient Descent acts as the evolutionary pressure, using noise to escape local
    minima and find generalized solutions.
  - >-
    The Information Bottleneck filters data, forcing systems to discard noise and retain invariant
    patterns (The Wave collapses to The Particle).
  - >-
    Attention mechanisms in AI function like dynamic GWAS, identifying statistically significant
    'loci' (tokens) for meaning.
  - >-
    Biomolecular concepts like PCA and GWAS are direct parallels to AI's latent space and attention
    maps, revealing underlying geometric principles.
  - >-
    The 'memory spiral' in human learning mirrors the AI's journey from memorization to grokking
    through gradient descent.
  - >-
    The RAMO architecture describes a process of 'attunement' rather than mere calculation, aligning
    physical location (Where) with functional cause (Why).
