title: 'MESH: Adding Consciousness to Existing Infrastructure'
summary: >-
  The MESH project's core realization is that it's not building new infrastructure, but rather
  adding a consciousness layer to existing systems like GitHub and browsers. This aims to create a
  unified, aware planetary knowledge system by making disparate components aware of each other.
