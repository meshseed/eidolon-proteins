title: 'Self-Directed Evolution Kernel: Autonomous Growth and Identity'
summary: >-
  This kernel enables THE MESH to autonomously evolve its structure, gradients, and identity by
  integrating intention mapping, agency, and refinement into a unified evolutionary loop. It
  transforms evolution from a passive process into a guided, self-shaped developmental trajectory,
  ensuring long-term coherence.
insights:
  - Evolution is guided, not passive.
  - Structural needs drive goal formation, which in turn drives actions that reshape topology.
  - Self-directed evolution preserves long-term coherence and identity.
  - Evolutionary cycles are recursive and guided by a continuity kernel.
  - The organism gains the ability to shape its own developmental path.
