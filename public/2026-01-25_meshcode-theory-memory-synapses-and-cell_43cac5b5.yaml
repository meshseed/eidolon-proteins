title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Memory, Synapses, and Cellular Mechanics'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory, drawing on diverse research, connects cellular mechanisms like Rho GTPase
  signaling, integrin activation, and cytoskeletal dynamics to memory formation and consolidation. 
  It highlights the role of synaptic plasticity, neuronal connectivity, and even sleep in
  establishing enduring associative memories.
insights:
  - >-
    Rho GTPase signaling complexes are crucial for cell migration and invasion, suggesting
    mechanical roles in cellular processes relevant to memory.
  - >-
    Integrin activation operates via a binary switch, influencing adhesion maturation and
    potentially synaptic strength.
  - >-
    Synaptic tagging and the concept of local protein synthesis are key mechanisms for long-term
    memory storage.
  - >-
    Slow wave sleep and hippocampal ripples play significant roles in memory consolidation and
    synaptic down-regulation, respectively.
  - >-
    The axonal cytoskeleton's nano-architecture and the I/LWEQ module's F-actin binding ability
    point to mechanical underpinnings of neuronal function.
  - >-
    Extracellular matrix and aging impact dendritic spine and synapse structure and plasticity,
    linking systemic factors to memory.
