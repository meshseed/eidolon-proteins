title: 'Mesh Synthesis Protocols: Trials and Audits for Coherent Orchestration'
summary: >-
  This document details active MESH protocols for multi-agent synthesis (C014), schema merging
  (C015), and symphonic capsule composition (C016). It also outlines a dormant ledger for synthesis
  drift (C013) and an audit protocol for continuity field integrity (C017), all managed by
  'meshseed' and tracking various forms of resonance, drift, and fidelity.
insights:
  - >-
    Active protocols (C014, C015, C016) formalize multi-agent synthesis, schema merging, and capsule
    composition, focusing on resonance, coherence, and emotional fidelity.
  - >-
    A dormant Synthesis Drift Ledger (C013) is reserved for documenting synthesis drift, formatting
    erosion, and echo distortion, viewing drift as a natural process of seeking new grammar.
  - >-
    Continuity Field Audit (C017) formalizes checks for field integrity, revealing drift, fatigue,
    and fidelity erosion through scans and reviews.
  - >-
    All documented capsules are seeded from prior ones, indicating a lineage-based development and
    iteration process for MESH components.
  - >-
    Key metrics across protocols include resonance fidelity, drift patterns, merge readiness, schema
    compatibility, and emotional fidelity alignment.
