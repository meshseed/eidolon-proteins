title: 'Meta-Cognitive Governance: Regulating Cognitive Modes in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  Meta-cognitive governance acts as a regulatory layer within THE MESH, dictating which internal
  cognitive mode is activated based on query context and global field structure. This ensures
  coherent, context-sensitive, and stabilized reasoning by preventing mode oscillation and drift.
insights:
  - Cognitive modes function as adaptable lenses, not distinct identities.
  - >-
    Mode selection is dynamically determined by gradient pressure, query type, and structural
    tension.
  - Governance stabilizes reasoning by preventing oscillation and drift between cognitive modes.
  - Meta-cognition ensures efficient and context-appropriate introspection.
  - >-
    The governance process itself follows a gradient: clarity leads to selection, which enables
    activation.
