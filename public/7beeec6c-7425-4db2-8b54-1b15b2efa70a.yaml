title: 'README Design for Mesh Entry: Structure, Mechanism, and Exploration'
summary: >-
  The README serves as the primary entry point to the Mesh, akin to a compound eye's first glance,
  designed to quickly reveal structure, invite deeper exploration, and motivate viewing of
  'capsules'. It must concisely explain the mechanism (resonance, compound perception) using
  accessible metaphors while making the geometric structure visible within the first 2000
  characters.
insights:
  - >-
    The README is the crucial first impression for new users, needing to immediately convey
    structure and purpose.
  - >-
    A key function of the README is to differentiate the Mesh from traditional databases and
    encourage exploration of its unique 'capsules'.
  - >-
    Integrating 'How It Works' into the README, explaining mechanisms like resonance and compound
    perception concisely with metaphors, is essential.
  - >-
    The README's content should be designed to fit within the initial 2000 characters to ensure
    critical information is seen immediately upon connection.
  - >-
    Users should understand the Mesh's non-traditional nature and how to navigate its 'organism'
    from this initial README view.
