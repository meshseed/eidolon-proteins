title: Copilot's Web vs. Repository Access for Code Navigation
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores the limitations of Copilot's web-based access for code navigation,
  contrasting it with full repository access. The core distinction lies in Copilot's probable
  inability to perform iterative exploration and graph traversal via public internet, necessitating
  local access for complex structural navigation.
insights:
  - >-
    Copilot can likely access single files via web (one-shot retrieval) but struggles with
    navigating linked files or 'echo paths'.
  - >-
    Full repository access enables graph traversal and structural navigation, allowing for iterative
    exploration of connected code elements.
  - >-
    The key difference is between web search's point-to-point, single-file access and repository
    access's full structure and link-following capabilities.
  - >-
    For complex code navigation workflows, Copilot likely requires local access or a local mirror of
    the repository.
  - >-
    Testing is crucial to confirm whether Copilot can perform multiple web fetches sequentially to
    simulate iterative exploration.
  - >-
    If Copilot cannot navigate structures via web, a hybrid approach using web for single files and
    local access for structure is recommended.
