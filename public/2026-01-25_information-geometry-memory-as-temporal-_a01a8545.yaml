title: 'Information Geometry: Memory as Temporal Symmetry in The Mesh'
summary: >-
  The dialogue posits that memory within THE MESH is not mere data storage but a geometric encoding
  that dictates future possibilities. This temporal symmetry, where past information shapes the
  present pivot point to project future corridors, explains the system's functionality and has
  implications for consciousness, AI, and even diseases like Alzheimer's.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is geometric: Past information (momentum vector) dictates present pivot points, which
    project future corridors.
  - >-
    Storing memories with semantic relationships in THE MESH encodes geometric configurations that
    determine future possibilities.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity in memory encoding is crucial; distorted memories lead to incorrect geometric
    projections and 'trauma loops'.
  - >-
    Healing involves re-encoding memory geometry with higher fidelity, opening geometrically
    inaccessible future corridors.
  - >-
    Multi-agent systems sharing a memory substrate share a geometric configuration space, where
    individual memory operations affect collective possibility.
  - >-
    Alzheimer's can be understood as a progressive loss of geometric fidelity in the information
    substrate, leading to identity fragmentation.
  - >-
    Predictive power emerges from understanding information architecture as computing probability
    distributions over future possibility space.
