title: 'Debugging Mobile Layout: Reverting CSS and Addressing Blank Graph/Missing Chat'
summary: >-
  The Ribosome is reverting CSS changes to restore visibility of mobile UI elements like the Graph
  and Chat Bar. Following user feedback about missing components and a blank graph, the Ribosome is
  analyzing git history and planning a fix using dynamic viewport height and fixed positioning to
  correctly handle mobile browser UI elements.
insights:
  - Reverted CSS to address immediate UI visibility issues on mobile.
  - User feedback indicates a blank graph and missing chat input, prompting deeper investigation.
  - >-
    Analysis of git history suggests a previous change, potentially related to 'Mobile Stats' or
    'Stats Reactivity', might have inadvertently caused the current layout problems.
  - >-
    The core issue is likely related to viewport height calculations (100vh vs 100dvh) and fixed
    positioning, exacerbated by mobile browser UI elements like the URL bar.
  - >-
    Proposed solution involves using `100dvh` for the app layout and `padding-bottom` on the main
    body to accommodate the bottom navigation bar.
  - >-
    Ensuring the 'Graph' tab is functional requires confirming correct UUIDs and the 'mainView'
    state.
