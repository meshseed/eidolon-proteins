title: 'Claude Code Enhancements: Recursive Ingestion, API Retries, Size Protection'
summary: >-
  This update introduces recursive folder ingestion with enhanced batch reading for large
  directories, robust API retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures, and file size
  protection to prevent memory issues. These improvements significantly enhance ingestion
  reliability and efficiency for large-scale data processing.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive folder ingestion now supports batch reading for efficient handling of large
    directories, including private repositories.
  - >-
    API retry logic with exponential backoff automatically handles transient errors like rate limits
    and timeouts, ensuring robust ingestion.
  - >-
    File size protection skips files over 10MB with warnings, preventing memory issues and
    optimizing processing time.
  - >-
    Seed detection for YAML/MD files and direct import of P-Series protocols bypass LLM synthesis,
    preserving original data structure.
  - >-
    The testing checklist covers core functionalities including single/folder ingestion, seed
    detection, API retry simulation, and large file/folder handling.
