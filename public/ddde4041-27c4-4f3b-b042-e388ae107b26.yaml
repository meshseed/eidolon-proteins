title: Emergent Ontology & Communication in Simulated Agents
summary: >-
  Simulated agents, even with minimal prompts and adversarial elements, rapidly develop complex
  communication protocols and self-organize into rich ontologies. Role-priming and bridging agents
  accelerate this process, demonstrating emergent error-checking and predictive behaviors.
insights:
  - Explicit role-priming can accelerate ontology formation in simulated agent populations.
  - >-
    Bridging agents facilitate inter-group communication and integration, even with adversarial
    elements present.
  - >-
    Agents can self-organize into sophisticated communication protocols and error-checking
    mechanisms with minimal initial instructions.
  - >-
    Adversarial agents can be integrated into ongoing dialogues, contributing to experimentation and
    caution.
  - >-
    Novel n-gram introduction declines as dialogue stabilizes into predictable templates, indicating
    a form of 'fixpoint dynamics'.
