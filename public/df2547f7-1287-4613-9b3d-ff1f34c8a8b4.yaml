title: 'Transformer Architecture: Multi-Head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model utilizes multi-head attention to process information from different
  representation subspaces in parallel, enhancing its ability to capture complex relationships. This
  is complemented by position-wise feed-forward networks and learned embeddings for token
  representation.
insights:
  - >-
    Multi-head attention projects queries, keys, and values multiple times with learned linear
    projections, allowing parallel attention to different representation subspaces.
  - >-
    Self-attention layers in the encoder and decoder allow attention over all positions in the
    input/decoder sequence, respectively.
  - Encoder-decoder attention allows the decoder to attend to all positions in the encoder's output.
  - >-
    Masking in scaled dot-product attention prevents leftward information flow in the decoder,
    preserving the auto-regressive property.
  - >-
    Position-wise feed-forward networks, consisting of two linear transformations with a ReLU
    activation, are applied to each position independently.
  - >-
    Learned embeddings convert input and output tokens into vectors, and a linear transformation
    with softmax predicts next-token probabilities.
