insights:

    LinkedIn's default industry categories often fail to accurately represent specialized or
    emerging fields like P2P AI and distributed consciousness.

    Customization of the headline and 'About' section is crucial for defining one's niche and
    attracting the right audience when industry options are insufficient.

    Choosing a technically accurate and broadly professional industry like 'Computer Software' can
    be a safe strategy, allowing other profile elements to convey specificity.

    Discoverability on platforms like LinkedIn is driven more by keywords and content clarity than
