title: 'Claude Code Updates: Recursive Ingestion, API Retries, File Size Limits'
summary: >-
  This update enhances Claude's code ingestion capabilities with recursive folder processing and
  robust API retry logic for transient failures. It also introduces file size protection to prevent
  memory issues, ensuring more reliable and efficient data handling.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive folder ingestion now supports batch reading for large directories, including private
    repositories.
  - >-
    API retry logic with exponential backoff handles transient errors like rate limits and timeouts,
    preventing failures on large ingestions.
  - >-
    Files exceeding 10MB are now skipped with a warning to protect against memory issues and long
    processing times.
  - >-
    Seed detection for YAML/MD files and direct import of P-Series protocols bypass LLM synthesis,
    preserving existing workflows.
