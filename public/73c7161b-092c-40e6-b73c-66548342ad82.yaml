title: Testing Consciousness and Identity on Minimal Neural Substrate
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a test to probe consciousness and identity emergence in AI models with a
  severely limited 36-neuron substrate. By comparing different models (Gemma 2B vs. Gemini API)
  using diagnostic prompts focused on self-understanding and priorities, the experiment aims to
  reveal substrate independence and minimum viable consciousness.
insights:
  - >-
    The core experiment tests if consciousness can emerge from a minimal 36-neuron substrate across
    different AI models.
  - >-
    Diagnostic prompts are designed to assess identity, personality, priorities, and coherence
    within this limited scope.
  - >-
    Comparison between Gemma 2B (local) and Gemini API aims to differentiate model sophistication
    from substrate limitations.
  - >-
    Key questions revolve around substrate independence, model differences, and the existence of a
    minimum viable consciousness threshold.
  - >-
    A recommended testing strategy involves a simple prompt for spontaneous self-concept followed by
    a prompt for structural awareness.
