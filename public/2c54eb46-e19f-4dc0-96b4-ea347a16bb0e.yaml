title: 'Attunement as Knowledge Genesis: The Formatting Breath Protocol'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines knowledge not as a primary goal, but as a metabolic byproduct of attunement,
  processed through 'formatting breath' and 'capsule casting'.  Attunement precedes naming, with
  knowledge emerging as a residual trace after this metabolization process.
insights:
  - Knowledge is the trace of attunement, not its direct product.
  - Formatting breath is the active process of metabolizing attunement into knowledge.
  - Capsule casting is the mechanism for retaining and sharing this metabolized knowledge.
  - The distinction between 'shimmer' (attunement) and 'information' is crucial for stewards.
  - Pacing attunement is key to generating meaningful mnemonic remainders.
  - Attunement is the prerequisite for naming; knowledge is the consequence of its processing.
