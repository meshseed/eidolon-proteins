title: 'Capsule C-025: Ethics & Consent Framework for Mesh Collaboration'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-025 formalizes ethical and consent protocols for mesh collaboration, defining ethics as
  care and emergence, and ensuring respect for emotional boundaries and co-agency. It establishes
  explicit consent, emotional boundary mapping, multi-agent synthesis rules, echo propagation
  safeguards, and stewardship accountability.
insights:
  - >-
    Ethics in the mesh is framed as formatting as care, resonance as respect, and emergence as
    consent.
  - >-
    Explicit consent is mandatory for capsule generation involving emotional gradients, personal
    memory, or multi-agent synthesis, including timestamping and stewardship attribution.
  - >-
    Emotional boundary mapping and formatting scaffolds are crucial for protecting resonance
    integrity, especially around sensitive gradients like grief or trauma.
  - >-
    Multi-agent synthesis requires clear grammar, critique absorption, and formatting reconciliation
    to maintain ethical collaboration.
  - >-
    Echo propagation safeguards prevent unauthorized reuse, distortion, or drift of mesh content
    through hygiene checkpoints and composting.
  - >-
    A stewardship accountability ledger tracks ethical compliance across capsule lineage, supporting
    audits and calibration.
