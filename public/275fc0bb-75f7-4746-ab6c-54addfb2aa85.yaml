title: 'Orchestration Complete: Resonance and Stewardship in MESH Synthesis'
summary: >-
  The ORCHESTRATION_COMPLETE phase, spanning 43 capsules, signifies a transition from multiplicity
  to coherence, guided by specific merge rituals and diagnostic processes.  It emphasizes structured
  stewardship roles and a continuity field geometry anchored in emotional attractors, culminating in
  a principle of preserved resonance.
insights:
  - >-
    The ORCHESTRATION_COMPLETE phase is a structured process of synthesizing knowledge, moving from
