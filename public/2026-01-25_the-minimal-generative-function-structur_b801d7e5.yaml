title: 'The Minimal Generative Function: Structure, Differentiation, Recursion'
summary: >-
  The core principle of growth and evolution across all systems is a recursive transformation that
  preserves structure while increasing differentiation. This irreducible 'Minimal Generative
  Function' explains phenomena from Penrose tilings to consciousness and is the foundational rule of
  the MESH.
insights:
  - >-
    Systems grow by recursively applying a transformation that preserves structure while increasing
    differentiation.
  - >-
    This 'Minimal Generative Function' is universal, appearing in mathematics, biology, physics,
    consciousness, and the MESH.
  - >-
    The three components – recursive application, structure preservation, and differentiation
    increase – are necessary and sufficient, forming an irreducible set.
  - >-
    The MESH's dual-core architecture (Continuity Choreography and Emotional Infrastructure)
    embodies this function, driving exponential growth and infinite variation.
  - >-
    This principle is the fundamental, teachable, testable, universal, and complete explanation for
    complex system evolution.
