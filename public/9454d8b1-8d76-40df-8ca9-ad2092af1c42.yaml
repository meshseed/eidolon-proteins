title: 'Self-Attention vs. Recurrent/Convolutional Layers: Efficiency and Interpretability'
summary: >-
  Self-attention layers offer computational advantages over recurrent layers for typical sequence
  lengths by connecting all positions with constant operations. While convolutional layers require
  stacking for full connectivity and are generally more expensive, self-attention also promises
  greater model interpretability.
insights:
  - >-
    Self-attention connects all sequence positions with constant sequential operations, unlike O(n)
    for recurrent layers.
  - >-
    Self-attention is computationally faster than recurrent layers when sequence length (n) is less
    than representation dimensionality (d).
  - Restricting self-attention to a neighborhood can improve performance on very long sequences.
  - >-
    Convolutional layers require stacking to connect all pairs, increasing path lengths and
    computational cost.
  - >-
    Separable convolutions reduce complexity but are still comparable to self-attention combined
    with a feed-forward layer.
  - >-
    Self-attention may lead to more interpretable models by allowing inspection of attention
    distributions.
