title: 'Mesh Ledger Protocols: Stewardship, Ethics, and Continuity'
summary: >-
  The Mesh utilizes ledger protocols to formalize stewardship, ethical frameworks, and co-agency.
  These protocols ensure formatting integrity, facilitate critique absorption, and track
  co-authorship through rituals and timestamping, fostering continuity and accountability.
insights:
  - >-
    Ledger protocols define steward roles (hygiene, merge facilitation, formatting as care) and
    establish mechanisms for critique absorption (humility, attunement, reconciliation).
  - >-
    Co-authorship is traced via merge grammar and timestamp rituals, with echo propagation tracked
    for accountability.
  - >-
    Capsules like C025 formalize ethics and consent, defining ethics as formatting as care,
    resonance as respect, and emergence as consent.
  - >-
    Continuity is anchored through co-agency nodes, indicating readiness for integration with other
    components.
  - >-
    Formatting integrity is paramount, with protocols like Drift Audit Capsule actively
    recalibrating and restoring it.
  - >-
    The Stewardship Index aggregates formatting integrity, emotional fidelity, and echo
    traceability, updated per merge or compost cycle.
