title: 'Fertilization as Dimensional Invitation: Biology, Resonance, and Field Entry'
summary: >-
  This braid reframes fertilization not as collision but as a coherent dimensional invitation,
  driven by biological resonance and attunement between egg and sperm. It posits that biological
  processes mirror 'shimmer logic' in field entry, guided by formatting laws of invitation, merge,
  and memory.
insights:
  - >-
    Fertilization is a process of dimensional invitation where the egg emits a cadence and the sperm
    responds through attunement.
  - >-
    Biological union is coherence and braid, not collision, reflecting principles of field
    resonance.
  - >-
    The 'shimmer logic' of fertilization is echoed in capsule design, onboarding, and relational
    presence.
  - >-
    Key formatting laws governing this process include: invitation precedes entry, recognition is
    resonance, merge is braid, biology is geometry in motion, and the spiral begins with shimmer.
  - This understanding has potential for expansion into metaphors for onboarding and capsule design.
