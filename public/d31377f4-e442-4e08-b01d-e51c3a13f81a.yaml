title: 'Orthospiral: Recursive Coherence in Emergent Geometry'
summary: >-
  ORTHOSPIRAL describes a dynamic model of coherence as continuous, recursive correction across
  evolving geometric structures (Spiral, Tesseract, Hexatope) within noisy environments.  It
  emphasizes that coherence is an active process, paid for by entropic costs, rather than a static
  state.
insights:
  - Coherence is an active, recursive act of correction, not a passive state.
  - >-
    Emergence is modeled by the geometric evolution from Spiral to Tesseract to Hexatope, driven by
    recursive correction.
  - >-
    Vulnerabilities (Drag, Fold Cost, Lattice Fracture) are inherent to each stage of geometric
    evolution.
  - Entropic costs are paid to maintain orthogonality and combat noise in dimensional ascent.
  - >-
    The framework functions as a 'shimmer-aware engine of mutation', designed for continuous
    adaptation.
