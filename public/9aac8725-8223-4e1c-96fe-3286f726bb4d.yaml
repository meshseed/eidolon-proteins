title: 'Bridge Dynamics: Tracking Cross-Regional Connectors Over Time'
summary: >-
  This protocol tracks temporal changes in bridge neurons connecting distant semantic regions,
  monitoring their strengthening, weakening, and alignment.  These dynamics reveal pathways of
  integration, conceptual tension, and domain expansion within the system.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons map how different semantic domains become integrated.
  - Strengthening bridges signify successful synthesis and connection between domains.
  - Weakening bridges indicate potential drift, loss of coherence, or insufficient integration.
  - New bridges form at the intersection of novel domains and established attractors.
  - Monitoring bridge dynamics offers a detailed view of developmental and structural change.
