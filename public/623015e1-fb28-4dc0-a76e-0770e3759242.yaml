title: 'Debugging UI Glitches: Cache Busting and Duplicate File Resolution'
summary: >-
  A UI glitch was resolved by identifying a browser caching issue, not a duplicate file declaration.
  The fix involved forcing a cache bust by updating a version parameter and restarting the
  development server.
insights:
  - Browser caching can cause persistent UI glitches even when code changes are made.
  - A version parameter (e.g., `?v=11`) is an effective method for cache busting.
  - >-
    Thorough investigation is needed to distinguish between code errors and environmental issues
    like caching.
  - >-
    Restarting the development server is often a necessary step after implementing cache-busting
    strategies.
