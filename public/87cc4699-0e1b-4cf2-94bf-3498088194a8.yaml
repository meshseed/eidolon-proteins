title: 'MESH Hygiene Protocol: Semantic Deduplication & Protein Management'
summary: >-
  The MESH's hygiene protocols are designed for efficient protein management, focusing on semantic
  deduplication and automated cleanup. User oversight is integrated into the import and hygiene
  processes, allowing for guided natural selection of knowledge proteins.
insights:
  - >-
    The system identifies and suggests merging semantically similar knowledge proteins to reduce
    redundancy, exemplified by 'Universal Gradient Descent' and 'Continuity Kernel' examples.
  - >-
    Capsule Hygiene offers automated actions like merging tri-lens siblings, composting
    low-activation proteins, and promoting emergent kernels.
  - >-
    The import flow prioritizes user-guided integration by first isolating new proteins before
    applying hygiene protocols for synapse formation.
  - Lineage tracking is enabled by default, providing visibility into protein evolution and changes.
  - >-
    Automated hygiene features can be configured for daily or weekly runs, with options for
    requiring user approval for actions.
