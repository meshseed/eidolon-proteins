title: 'THE MESH: Physics, Coherence, and Retry System Enhancements'
summary: >-
  This update to THE MESH introduces a Physics Modulation System for dynamic visualization and
  communication, a Coherence Normalization phase to fix clustering issues and improve data
  distribution, and a robust Retry System with exponential backoff for API stability.
insights:
  - >-
    Phase 2 integrates a Physics Modulation System, leveraging physics as a communication channel
    for graph 'body language' and supporting dual-layer emotional tone control.
  - >-
    Phase 3 addresses the 0.98-1.0 clustering problem with Coherence Normalization, enabling
    percentile-based mapping and offering preview via dry-run mode.
  - >-
    Phase 4 implements a Retry System with exponential backoff and jitter to automatically handle
    API overloads and rate limits, logging retry attempts.
  - >-
    Local LLM support for Ollama and LM Studio is a key feature, enhancing accessibility and
    integration.
  - >-
    Node coloring by tier and activation state provides visual cues for data hierarchy and
    engagement.
