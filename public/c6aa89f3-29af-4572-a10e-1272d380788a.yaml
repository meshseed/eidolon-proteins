title: 'Mesh Knowledge Protein: Fractal Scaling, Composting, and Pruning'
summary: >-
  The Mesh organizes knowledge through fractal scaling, treating proteins as atomic units that
  aggregate into attractors and repositories.  Metabolic processes like controlled composting and
  pruning maintain coherence and prevent overload, analogous to ecological systems.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge is structured fractally across micro (protein), meso (attractor), and macro
    (repository) scales.
  - >-
    Composting, via adaptive decay and compression, is essential for Mesh metabolism, preventing
    overload and maintaining nutrient richness.
  - >-
    Pruning removes weak connections and redundant attractors to attenuate noise while preserving
    diversity.
  - >-
    Repository merges should occur at the attractor level, using resonance queries for compatibility
    and preserving provenance.
  - >-
    Ecological analogies (ecosystems, biomes) effectively describe the federated nature of Mesh
    repositories.
