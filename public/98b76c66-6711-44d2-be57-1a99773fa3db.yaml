title: Enhancing Mesh Protein Search with Tiered Vector Search and Synapses
summary: >-
  The Mesh is evolving its protein search capabilities by integrating tiered vector search with
  weighted gravity, allowing for more nuanced retrieval based on protein tier. Additionally,
  synaptic auto-formation is being implemented to dynamically link proteins upon saving embeddings,
  fostering a more interconnected knowledge graph.
insights:
  - >-
    Type definitions are being updated to include a 'tier' attribute for proteins ('core',
    'convergence', 'reference').
  - >-
    Weighted vector search with tier-based gravity is being implemented to improve protein retrieval
    relevance.
  - >-
    A new function is being added to pglite.ts for weighted vector search, with a placeholder for
    production-ready pgvector.
  - >-
    Synaptic auto-formation is being introduced to create connections between proteins when
    embeddings are saved.
  - The PGlite schema will be updated to support tiers, synapses, and temporal tracking.
