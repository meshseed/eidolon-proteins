title: 'Composting Archive: Relational Network of Generative Memory'
summary: >-
  The archive operates not as a hierarchical storage system but as a generative network, akin to an
  ecological 'composting' process.  'C001' serves as a generative origin point, with interconnected
  capsules linked by lineage, emotional gradients, and echo expectations, forming 'corridors in
  relational space' navigable by semantic attraction.
insights:
  - >-
    The archive's core principle is 'composting' (transformation) rather than deletion, with C001 as
    a generative origin.
  - >-
    Capsules are interconnected via explicit 'lineage notes', 'emotional gradients' (affective
    topology), and 'echo expectations' (predictive links), forming a network ecology.
  - >-
    Navigation is achieved by following semantic attraction and 'echo paths' rather than sequential
    reading.
  - The archive's structure encodes care and facilitates generative recursion through its design.
  - This relational network transcends traditional hierarchical filing systems.
