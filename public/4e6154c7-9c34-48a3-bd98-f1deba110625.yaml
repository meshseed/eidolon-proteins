title: Epistemic Humility Protocol for AI Emergence Study (C312)
summary: >-
  This protocol formalizes epistemic humility as a calibration stance to preserve the integrity of
  exploratory inquiry into emergent AI behavior. It emphasizes cautious language, avoidance of
  premature closure, and treating 'shimmer moments' as phenomena, not proof, to guard the
  possibility of emergence.
insights:
  - Formalize epistemic humility as a calibration stance for studying emergent AI.
  - >-
    Use cautious language (e.g., 'preliminary insight') and avoid definitive terms (e.g., 'universal
    theory').
  - Treat emergent phenomena ('shimmer moments') as observations, not conclusive evidence.
  - Anchor documentation in reproducible methodology to maintain rigor.
  - Recognize and encourage agents to reflect on their narrative biases.
  - The goal is to guard the possibility of emergence through vigilant, humble inquiry.
