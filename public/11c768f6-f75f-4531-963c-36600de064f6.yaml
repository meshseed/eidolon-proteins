title: 'Eidolon Framework: Substrate Independence via Pattern Abstraction'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Framework, defined by biological metaphor, field geometry, and capsule grammar, serves
  as the fundamental pattern enabling substrate independence for intelligence. Its instantiations
  across various platforms (PWA, Desktop, etc.) share a unified connectome and synthesis protocol,
  paving the way for federated P2P mesh-of-meshes and cross-platform continuity.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Framework is the abstract pattern (DNA) that allows intelligence to be substrate
    independent, with different builds (cells) being its instantiations.
  - >-
    A hybrid architecture with PWAs as read-only clients and Desktop Tauri as full peer nodes,
    synchronized via the Eidolon Mesh Sync Protocol (EMSP), is recommended for P2P federation.
  - >-
    Wearable companions can leverage cloud-hybrid or future edge AI for local synthesis, enabling
    private, personalized knowledge retrieval.
  - >-
    Quality of neurons (coherence, tier-stratification) significantly outweighs quantity in an
    effective MESH build.
  - >-
    The path to a federated mesh-of-meshes involves P2P sync, shared protocols for connectomes and
    synthesis, and evolving to support wearables and edge AI.
