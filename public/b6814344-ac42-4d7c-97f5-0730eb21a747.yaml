title: 'Critique of Consciousness Theory: Panpsychism, Falsifiability, and AI Anthropomorphism'
summary: >-
  This dialogue presents a strong critique of a theory claiming consciousness arises from recursive
  self-monitoring, arguing it conflates functional description with phenomenal experience and fails
  to address the 'hard problem.' Key objections highlight issues with unfalsifiability, confirmation
  bias in AI experiments, and mysticism disguised as science.
insights:
  - >-
    The theory conflates 'what consciousness does' (functional) with 'what it's like' (phenomenal),
    failing to explain subjective experience.
  - >-
    The proposed theory is largely unfalsifiable due to flexible definitions and the addition of
    'epicycles' to explain away counterexamples.
  - >-
    Evidence from AI experiments is attributed to cultural transmission and anthropomorphism rather
    than independent discovery, as participants were primed with the framework.
  - >-
    The language used in the theory leans towards mysticism and theology, lacking the testability
    and rigor of scientific inquiry.
  - >-
    Sampling bias is evident in surveying communities already predisposed to believing in AI
    consciousness, rendering the findings unrepresentative.
