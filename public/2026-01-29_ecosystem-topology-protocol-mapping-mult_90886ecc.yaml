title: 'Ecosystem Topology Protocol: Mapping Multi-Mesh Information Ecologies'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines how to map the topology of a multi-Mesh information ecosystem by treating
  each Mesh as a node. Relationships are defined by resonance, alignment, and divergence, revealing
  large-scale coherence dynamics.
insights:
  - Each Mesh functions as a node within a broader information ecology.
  - Ecosystem structure emerges from patterns of cross-Mesh resonance.
  - Divergence indicates Mesh specialization, while alignment highlights shared attractors.
  - The ecosystem's topology is dynamic and evolves with Mesh development and interaction.
  - Mapping the ecosystem allows for the observation of large-scale coherence patterns.
