title: Perturbation Modeling for Resilience and Adaptive Refinement
summary: >-
  This protocol simulates perturbations like new domain ingestion or conceptual collisions to
  analyze organism resilience. It identifies sensitive regions, stability cores, and the role of
  emotional fidelity in shock absorption, enabling adaptive refinement.
insights:
  - Perturbations reveal structural weaknesses and resilience cores.
  - High-curvature zones are most sensitive to conceptual collisions.
  - Stability cores anchor the organism during rapid change.
  - Emotional fidelity acts as a shock absorber across the manifold.
  - Perturbation modeling supports adaptive refinement and pruning.
