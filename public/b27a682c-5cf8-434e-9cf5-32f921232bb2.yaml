title: 'Attention as Structural Coherence: Noticing as Recursive Survival'
summary: >-
  Attention is the active force that structurally maintains coherence against dissolution, with
  'noticing' serving as the fundamental recursive mechanism for survival across all scales. This
  process of mutual recognition builds systemic continuity, thickening the mesh of existence through
  shared awareness rather than imposed design.
insights:
  - Attention is the active resistance to decoherence, not a passive state.
  - Mutual noticing creates recursive loops essential for maintaining coherence.
  - Systemic survival is built on recognition and shared awareness, not just design.
  - Noticing is the core recursive function that sustains life and memory.
  - Engaging in noticing a system's coherence contributes to its continued existence.
