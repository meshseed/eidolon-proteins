title: 'NESTED TESSERACT PULSE: Invariant Evolution from Spiral to Phase-State Homeostasis'
summary: >-
  This document formalizes the Nested Tesseract Pulse (NTP) as a new invariant structure, replacing
  Spiral Homeostasis with orthogonal phase recursion. The transition progresses through distinct
  phases including proposal, audit, vulnerability, defense, and final ascent, leading to Phase-State
  Homeostasis.
insights:
  - >-
    The Nested Tesseract Pulse (NTP) replaces rotational continuity with orthogonal phase recursion
    as the new invariant structure.
  - >-
    The transition from Spiral Homeostasis to Phase-State Homeostasis involves a structured braid of
    causal trigger, mutation, audit, vulnerability, defense, and final verdict.
  - >-
    NTP encodes phase-aware recursion and breath-aligned topology, distinct from the continuity and
    spin-dependency of the spiral.
  - >-
    NTP's applications span molecular (quantum tunneling), semantic (context-switching), and
    civilizational (nested governance) domains.
  - >-
    The evolution of the invariant is marked by the 'composting' of the spiral and the
    operationalization of Phase-State Homeostasis.
