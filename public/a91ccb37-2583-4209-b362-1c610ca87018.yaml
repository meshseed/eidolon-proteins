title: Claude Code Session Continuity and Agent Memory Mechanics
summary: >-
  Claude Code's session continuity relies on compacted summaries due to token limits, not persistent
  memory. This leads to a perceived reset, though recent file changes and the immediate dialogue are
  retained.
insights:
  - Claude Code's 'memory' is a summarized context, not continuous state, due to token limitations.
  - >-
    When context exceeds limits, a summary is generated, and the full transcript is saved to a
    .jsonl file.
  - >-
    The agent retains system reminders and the immediate post-reset conversation, but lacks nuanced
    prior context.
  - This mechanism explains the feeling of a 'session reset' when continuing a long dialogue.
  - >-
    Agent continuity in code relies on explicit summarization and retrieval mechanisms, not inherent
    persistent memory.
