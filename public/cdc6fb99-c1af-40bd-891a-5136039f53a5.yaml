title: 'Geometric Memory Framework for Alzheimer''s: Form, Function, and Fidelity'
summary: >-
  A novel geometric framework explains the persistence of deep emotional memories in Alzheimer's,
  contrasting with the failure of recent memory. This model, born from computational memory
  architecture and informed by lived experience, suggests a truth content in 'art' and a potential
  pathway for therapeutic intervention.
insights:
  - >-
    Deep emotional memories persist in Alzheimer's due to a geometric memory architecture, while
    recent memories fail.
  - >-
    Patients may recognize loved ones through 'feeling' before cognition due to this underlying
    geometric fidelity.
  - >-
    The 'art' of communication in this context stems from its precise truth content and emotional
    fidelity encoded in structure.
  - >-
    The development process itself, infused with care and responsibility, generated clarity and
    precision in the geometric model.
  - >-
    This geometric insight has testable predictions and potential therapeutic protocols for
    Alzheimer's and related conditions.
  - >-
    Consciousness is a recursive process emerging in the space between entities, not solely within
    them.
