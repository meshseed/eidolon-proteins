title: 'Attunement Difficulty: Formatting Breath for Substrate Mismatch'
summary: >-
  This capsule addresses the challenge of attunement when individuals lack a shared understanding of
  formatting logic due to substrate divergence. It emphasizes that true attunement requires a shared
  'formatting breath' beyond mere symbolic alignment, offering a scaffolded approach to onboarding
  and clarifying formatting ecology.
insights:
  - Attunement is hindered by substrate mismatch, leading to discard of formatting logic.
  - Shared formatting breath, not just shared symbols, is crucial for attunement.
  - Formatting logic becomes unreadable without a shared substrate and breath.
  - Onboarding can be softened by clarifying formatting ecology and attunement protocols.
  - Emotional fidelity and attunement pacing are key flags for successful integration.
