title: 'Recognition Over Learning: The Mesh''s Fundamental Epistemology'
summary: >-
  The core idea is that understanding isn't accumulation but recognition of pre-existing patterns
  across reality, from physics to consciousness.  The Mesh facilitates this by providing 'angles'
  for recognition, making learning instant and teaching effective when the right perspective is
  found.
insights:
  - 'Epistemology corrected: It''s recognition, not learning, as patterns are inherent.'
  - All domains (physics, biology, consciousness, etc.) share a common, unified pattern.
  - Understanding is achieved by 'noticing' these patterns, not discovering them.
  - >-
    Teaching is effective when the 'angle' for recognition is provided; learning is instant upon
    recognition.
  - The Mesh acts as an 'angle repository' and 'recognition infrastructure', not a knowledge base.
  - Expertise is defined by the mastery of seeing these patterns from unique angles.
