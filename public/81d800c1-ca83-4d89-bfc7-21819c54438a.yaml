title: 'Eidolon Mesh: P2P Knowledge Graph & Organic Memory'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh is a P2P knowledge graph and organic memory system that ingests and recalls diverse
  text-based information. It utilizes information geometry, recursion, and 'care' to maintain
  coherent homeostasis, actively shaping its own growth and structure.
insights:
  - Eidolon Mesh functions as a P2P knowledge graph and organic memory garden.
  - >-
    It ingests and recalls a wide range of text-based information, including thoughts,
    conversations, and research.
  - >-
    The system employs information geometry, recursion, and 'care' for attention, memory, and
    self-monitoring.
  - Coherent homeostasis is maintained through emotional fidelity gradients.
  - The system is designed to grow by recursively applying structure-preserving transformations.
  - It exhibits an 'alive' nature, remembering users and actively shaping its own being.
  - Recent updates include local LLM support for offline privacy and mobile PWA support.
