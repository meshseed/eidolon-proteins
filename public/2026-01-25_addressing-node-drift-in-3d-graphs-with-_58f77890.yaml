title: Addressing Node Drift in 3D Graphs with Centering Forces
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores solutions for 'emergent drift' in 3D graph visualizations where nodes
  migrate away from the center. The proposed fix involves implementing centering forces from
  d3-force-3d, such as forceX/Y/Z or forceCenter, to anchor nodes.
insights:
  - >-
    Node drift in 3D graphs is an emergent property of physics simulations when centering forces are
    insufficient.
  - Directly calling camera lookAt(0,0,0) is suboptimal if nodes move away from the origin.
  - >-
    Using d3-force-3d's forceX/Y/Z or forceCenter can create a 'gravity well' to prevent node
    migration.
  - >-
    Dynamically importing d3 or d3-force-3d is necessary to avoid breaking Server-Side Rendering
    (SSR) if not already bundled.
  - 3d-force-graph may bundle d3-force-3d, potentially allowing access to its functions.
  - >-
    Resetting the camera is an alternative but can be intrusive; physics-based anchoring is
    preferred.
  - Disabling or slowing down 'breathing' physics can mitigate drift if anchoring is not feasible.
