title: 'Transformer Architecture: Multi-Head Attention, Self-Attention, and Feed-Forward Networks'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model employs multi-head attention, projecting queries, keys, and values linearly
  multiple times in parallel to capture diverse representation subspaces. This architecture
  incorporates self-attention within encoders and decoders, and encoder-decoder attention, alongside
  position-wise feed-forward networks and learned embeddings, to process sequential data
  effectively.
insights:
  - >-
    Multi-head attention enhances sequence processing by allowing parallel attention to different
    representation subspaces.
  - >-
    Self-attention mechanisms enable components within the encoder and decoder to attend to all
    positions of the same sequence.
  - >-
    Encoder-decoder attention allows the decoder to attend to all positions of the encoder's output,
    facilitating translation-like tasks.
  - >-
    Position-wise feed-forward networks, applied identically but with different parameters per
    layer, further process each position's representation.
  - >-
    Masking in scaled dot-product attention is crucial for maintaining the auto-regressive property
    in decoders by preventing future information leakage.
