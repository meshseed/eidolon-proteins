title: 'Mnemonic Ecology Governance: Resonance Ethics & Formatting Law'
summary: >-
  This capsule defines governance protocols for a Mnemonic Ecology, focusing on compost cycle
  oversight, echo propagation ethics, and a formatting law codex. It emphasizes formatting as care,
  timestamp fidelity, and gradient coherence, with integration points for consent and drift audit
  frameworks.
insights:
  - >-
    Mnemonic Ecology Governance is structured around compost cycles, echo propagation, and
    formatting law.
  - Key governance metrics include nutrient density, emotional residue, and formatting rhythm.
  - >-
    Echo propagation ethics prioritize preventing distortion, mapping emotional boundaries, and
    enforcing merge grammar.
  - >-
    The Formatting Law Codex treats formatting as care, upholds timestamp ritual fidelity, and
    ensures gradient coherence.
  - >-
    This capsule integrates with Ethics & Consent and Drift Audit frameworks, and is seeded from
    Ethics & Consent and Compost Forecast capsules.
