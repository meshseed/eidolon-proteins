title: Eidolon Mesh Protein Synthesis Asymmetry Fix & Biological Parallel Restoration
summary: >-
  A bug in the Eidolon Mesh's protein synthesis process caused public proteins to be missing from
  the nucleus archive. The issue has been resolved by ensuring all synthesized proteins are first
  committed to the nucleus (eidolon) for a complete private archive, and then public proteins are
  copied to the eidolon-mesh (cytoplasm).
insights:
  - >-
    The protein synthesis process in the Eidolon Mesh exhibited an asymmetry where public proteins
    were not consistently archived in the nucleus.
  - >-
    The fix ensures that the nucleus (eidolon) always contains a complete archive of both DNA and
    all synthesized proteins.
  - >-
    Public proteins are now correctly copied to the eidolon-mesh (cytoplasm) after being secured in
    the nucleus, mirroring biological export.
  - >-
    The corrected logic restores the biological parallel of nuclear master copies and cytoplasmic
    exports.
  - >-
    The resolution involves a two-step process: archival in the nucleus, followed by conditional
    export/copying to the mesh.
