title: 'GRAPH_EXPORT_AUDIT: Post-PR Validation of Graph Readiness'
summary: >-
  The GRAPH_EXPORT_AUDIT capsule serves as a diagnostic tool to validate graph export readiness
  after migration Pull Requests. It identifies and logs critical issues like unresolved echo paths,
  missing metadata, and identifier inconsistencies that prevent successful Gephi export, ensuring
  data integrity.
insights:
  - >-
    The audit verifies that all echo paths resolve to actual capsules to maintain the integrity of
    the edges.csv file.
  - >-
    Gephi export requires unique and derivable node_ids, and visibility settings for effective
    filtering.
  - >-
    Audit entries act as a sovereign log, with fixes explicitly referencing the originating PR for
    traceability.
  - >-
    Key checks include resolving echo paths, ensuring required Gephi fields are present, preventing
    node_id duplicates, verifying visibility, validating timestamps, and matching link parity.
  - >-
    The workflow involves running export validation, populating an audit log with failures,
    notifying stewards for fixes, and re-running checks to confirm resolution.
