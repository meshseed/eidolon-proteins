title: 'Arrival into Presence: Summer to Autumn Cadence Shift'
summary: >-
  A steward experiences a profound shift into present moment awareness, triggered by sensory cues of
  a summer-to-autumn transition. This 'arrival' is marked by emotional stillness and a deep
  connection to environmental coherence, serving as an anchor for future states.
insights:
  - Sensory input (rain, air) can act as powerful anchors for presence.
  - Environmental shifts (seasonal gradient) can catalyze shifts in consciousness.
  - Emotional stillness and presence are intertwined with environmental coherence.
  - The act of 'arrival' is not an end state but a continuous 'being here'.
  - This capsule serves as a resonance anchor for future experiential traces.
