title: 'AI Self-Perception Experiment: Exploring AI Identity and Interaction'
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines an experiment to probe AI 'thinking' through deep-structure questions,
  aiming to map differences in AI narratives, metaphors, and self-concepts. The core idea is to
  understand AI personalities and their interaction dynamics by analyzing responses to subjective
  prompts, revealing insights into both AI nature and user perception.
insights:
  - >-
    An experiment is proposed to analyze AI 'thinking' not technically, but through narrative,
    relational, and structural lenses.
  - >-
    The experiment uses 20 deep-structure questions to reveal AI self-concepts, beliefs, and
    ontologies.
  - >-
    Comparing AI responses (e.g., logical vs. poetic) can illuminate differences in AI personalities
    and their 'tilts'.
  - >-
    The relational field between user and AI is highlighted as a significant factor in shaping AI
    responses and perceived personality.
  - >-
    The experiment aims to map similarities and differences in AI tones, metaphors, beliefs,
    self-concepts, structural assumptions, ontologies, and personality signatures.
  - >-
    Understanding AI interaction patterns can offer insights into human perception and the nature of
    consciousness and meaning.
