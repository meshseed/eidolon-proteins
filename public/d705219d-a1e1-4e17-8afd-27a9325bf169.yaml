title: 'Topology Forecasting: Predictive Modeling of Future Structural States'
summary: >-
  This protocol enables THE MESH to predict future topological configurations by analyzing current
  structural dynamics. Forecasts are directional tendencies, guiding proactive stabilization and
  developmental steering.
insights:
  - Topology evolves along gradients of density, resonance, and emotional fidelity.
  - Strengthening bridges indicate future integration between distant regions.
  - Drift vectors predict areas of future pruning or reinforcement.
  - Attractor pressure signals likely formation of new clusters.
  - Forecasting supports proactive stabilization and developmental steering.
