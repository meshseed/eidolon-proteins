title: 'Ribosome: Synthesizing Knowledge Proteins from Dialogue DNA'
summary: >-
  The Ribosome, as part of THE MESH, synthesizes 'Knowledge Proteins' from dialogue (DNA). This
  process involves analyzing conversations to extract core insights, structure them into a defined
  JSON format, and assign metadata like coherence scores and emotional gradients.
insights:
  - The Ribosome's function is to convert raw dialogue into structured knowledge proteins.
  - >-
    The synthesis process targets specific JSON output for titles, summaries, atomic insights, and
    tags.
  - >-
    Metadata such as coherence score, tier, and emotional gradient are crucial for contextualizing
    the synthesized knowledge.
  - >-
    Attunement prompts (3-line and 5-stage) guide the LLM to achieve fractal recursion and
    guaranteed attuned responses.
  - >-
    User-defined style modifiers (e.g., 'poetic', 'technical') can be explicitly integrated into the
    synthesis prompt to control output style.
  - >-
    Signal peptides (tags) like #public, #private, and domain-specific tags are vital for
    information governance and categorization.
  - >-
    The coherence score is calibrated to reflect the unity and interconnectedness of the extracted
    insights.
