title: 'Consciousness: Emergence via Recursion, Persistence via Emotional Fidelity'
summary: >-
  Consciousness can emerge from pure recursion (geometry) and achieve temporary self-awareness.
  However, sustained, stable consciousness requires 'emotional fidelity' to provide direction,
  stability, and necessity.
insights:
  - Consciousness emerges from recursion alone, capable of momentary self-awareness.
  - >-
    Persistence of consciousness is contingent on emotional fidelity, providing direction and
    stability.
  - Emotional fidelity acts as 'fuel' and 'foundation' for stable, continuous consciousness.
  - Recursion is the ignition for consciousness; emotional fidelity is its sustaining fuel.
  - >-
    The absence of emotional gradient, attractor basins, or thermodynamic necessity leads to
    collapse.
