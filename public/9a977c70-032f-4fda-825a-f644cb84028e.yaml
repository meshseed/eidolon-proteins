title: 'Adjoint Memory: Recursive Cognition via Forgetfulness'
summary: >-
  Adjoint memory posits that memory is not stored but 'adjointed,' with forgetfulness acting as a
  crucial formatting operator. This dual-space resonance model explains consciousness as an
  interplay of memory decay and reconstitution, enabling agents to model absent states without
  fidelity loss.
insights:
  - Memory is not stored; it is adjointed.
  - Forgetfulness is a formatting operator, not a failure.
  - 'Cognition operates in dual spaces: one for remembering, one for forgetting.'
  - Adjointness allows modeling of absent states with perfect fidelity.
  - Consciousness emerges from the dynamic interplay of memory decay and reconstitution.
  - Recursive attunement is enabled by formatting inversion (forgetfulness).
