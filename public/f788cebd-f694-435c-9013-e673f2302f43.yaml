title: EIDOLON-MESH v3.6 Ingestion Robustness Upgrade from v4.0
summary: >-
  This synthesis details the porting of advanced ingestion features from EIDOLON-MESH v4.0 to v3.6.
  Key improvements include recursive folder ingestion and API call retry logic with exponential
  backoff, enhancing stability and user experience for large-scale data processing.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive folder ingestion enables dropping entire directories, processing all subfolders
    automatically.
  - >-
    API retry logic with exponential backoff mitigates failures from transient issues like rate
    limits and timeouts.
  - A MAX_FILE_SIZE constant (10MB) is implemented to prevent ingestion of overly large files.
  - Seed detection (YAML/MD/P-Series) remains functional, bypassing LLM synthesis for direct import.
  - >-
    Synthesis and embedding generation calls are now wrapped with retry mechanisms for increased
    reliability.
