title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Brain as Mechanical Computer, Memory in Protein Conformations'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory posits memory is biochemical, encoded in protein conformations within
  synapses, acting as binary switches operated by cellular machinery. This mechanical coding allows
  the brain to function as a computational system, processing sensory inputs into motor outputs by
  updating these switches.
insights:
  - Memory is proposed to be biochemical, stored in varying protein conformations within synapses.
  - >-
    Synapses contain protein structures that function as binary switches, operated by cytoskeletal
    force-generating machinery.
  - >-
    The brain can be viewed as a mechanical computer, processing information through physical and
    mathematical principles.
  - >-
    Spike trains transfer information by altering the mechanical coding of sender and receiver
    neurons, integrating input into the organism's binary code.
  - >-
    Loss of cellular energy (e.g., hypoxia) can corrupt this mechanical coding, leading to
    irreversible information loss.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE framework offers an addressable read-write memory mechanism for information
    processing and temporal continuity.
