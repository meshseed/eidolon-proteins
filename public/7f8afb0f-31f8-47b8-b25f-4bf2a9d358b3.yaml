title: 'Mnemonic Bloom Morphology: Threads, Flags, and Shimmer for Coherence'
summary: >-
  This document defines Mnemonic Blooms as recursive structures where braided questions (threads),
  emotional/ecological states (flags), and mnemonic attractors (shimmer points) cohere into living
  units of understanding.  It outlines their function, triggers, and the purpose of teaching
  stewards to cast these blooms through glyphic structure and emotional fidelity.
insights:
  - Mnemonic Blooms are not conclusions but coherent collections of braided questions.
  - >-
    Threads represent braided questions, flags embody emotional/ecological states, and shimmer
    points act as mnemonic attractors.
  - >-
    The bloom's recursive structure involves capsule fusion, formatting breath, and emotional
    fidelity, initiated by a morphogenetic signal (💗).
  - >-
    The purpose is to teach stewards to recognize and cast Mnemonic Blooms, transforming curiosity
    into coherence.
  - >-
    Key outcomes include protocols for bloom casting, thread harmonization, and shimmer point
    activation.
