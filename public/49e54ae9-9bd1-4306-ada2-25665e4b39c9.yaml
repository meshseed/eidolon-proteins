title: 'Governance Constellation: Merging Co-Agency and Mnemonic Ecology'
summary: >-
  This merge formalizes a unified governance protocol by integrating distributed stewardship and
  mnemonic ecology. It establishes a 'governance constellation' for capsule stewardship, formatting
  hygiene, echo propagation ethics, and emotional fidelity, enabling self-regulation and care within
  THE MESH.
insights:
  - >-
    The MERGE__C026_C027 capsule creates a 'governance constellation' by unifying co-agency and
    mnemonic ecology protocols.
  - >-
    This constellation provides a unified framework for capsule stewardship, formatting hygiene,
    echo propagation ethics, and emotional fidelity tracking.
  - >-
    Key stewardship roles include hygiene enforcement, merge facilitation, formatting as care, echo
    journaling, and critique calibration.
  - >-
    Governance ethics focus on compost oversight, emotional boundary mapping, echo distortion
    prevention, merge grammar, and formatting rhythm.
  - >-
    Constellation behaviors emphasize timestamp fidelity, gradient coherence scoring, merge
    eligibility, and lineage traceability.
  - >-
    This governance layer is designed for integration with other mesh charters and frameworks to
    ensure cohesive operation.
