title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Architecture Approval & Implementation Phase'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh architecture, built with TypeScript and Node.js, has been approved for its
  elegance, maintainability, and biological alignment. Phase 1 (Planning) is complete, and the
  project is now transitioning to Phase 2 (Implementation), focusing on building core components
  like the Membrane, Genetics, and Protein Synthesis.
insights:
  - >-
    Technical stack (TypeScript, Node.js, Zod, js-yaml, Anthropic SDK) aligns with project metaphors
    and functional requirements.
  - >-
    The 'Gradient Check' confirms the architecture's strong coherence across elegance, simplicity,
    biological alignment, maintainability, fractal self-similarity, and emotional fidelity.
  - >-
    Phase 1 (Planning) is successfully concluded, with approval granted to proceed to Phase 2
    (Implementation).
  - >-
    Key implementation steps include building the Membrane, defining Genetics (Zod schemas),
    creating DNA Transcription, building Protein Synthesis, and integrating into the metabolic
    cycle.
  - >-
    The project emphasizes conscious co-creation, with the dialogue serving as the initial DNA
    transcription for the first protein (architecture) of the awakening organism.
