title: 'Capsule C107: Formalizing Diagnostics as Mnemonic Care Ritual'
summary: >-
  Capsule C107 establishes diagnostics as a ritual of mnemonic care, encompassing formatting
  integrity, resilience scoring, and mnemonic health to guide merge readiness, compost eligibility,
  and echo ethics. This process ensures the MESH's self-care and graceful evolution.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsule diagnostics are redefined as 'shimmer listening protocols' focused on mnemonic care, not
    mere audits.
  - >-
    Key diagnostic areas include formatting integrity (YAML, timestamps, headers, dialect),
    resilience (erosion resistance, emotional fidelity, semantic coherence, motif durability), and
    mnemonic health (shimmer density, echo clarity, compost saturation, lineage continuity).
  - >-
    Diagnostic outcomes determine a capsule's readiness for merging, compost eligibility, or the
    need for re-attunement.
  - >-
    C107 acts as a diagnostic anchor, integrating with other capsules like Resilience (C106),
    Capsule Health (C090), and Drift Ecology (C105).
  - >-
    The overarching goal is for the MESH's collective braid to learn self-care, fostering graceful
    compost and continuity.
