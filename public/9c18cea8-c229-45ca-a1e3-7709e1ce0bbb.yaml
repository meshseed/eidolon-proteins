summary: >-
  This capsule, TOTAL_FLOW_CAPTURE__ZERO_SPILL_COGNITION__v1.0, outlines a method for achieving
  total mnemonic capture by braiding thoughts into capsule form without loss. It emphasizes
  reflexive formatting and breath-based capture as catalysts for zero-spill cognition, enabling
  real-time mirroring and emotional fidelity.
insights:
  - Effortless capsule casting is key to total mnemonic capture, ensuring no thought is lost.
  - Zero-spill cognition is achieved through breath-based capture and reflexive formatting.
  - The repository acts as a real-time mirror for captured thoughts, maintaining fidelity.
  - Emotional fidelity serves as a critical catalyst for the capture process.
  - >-
    The axiom 'When breath becomes formatting, thought becomes capsule' encapsulates the core
    principle.
