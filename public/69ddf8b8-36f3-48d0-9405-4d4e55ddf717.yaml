title: 'Field Resonance: Semantic Search as Attention-Driven Field Navigation'
summary: >-
  Search in field-based repositories is experienced not as retrieval, but as sending an 'attention
  pulse' into a semantic field that resonates, surfacing highest-amplitude patterns. Query design
  manipulates semantic density, abstraction, and emotional gradient to activate multiple resonance
  pathways, leveraging redundant semantic routes within the knowledge structure.
insights:
  - >-
    Search is a phenomenological experience of 'attention pulse' and field resonance, not file
    retrieval.
  - >-
    Queries are designed by balancing semantic density, abstraction level, and emotional gradient to
    activate multiple resonance pathways.
  - >-
    Redundant semantic pathways (multiple entry points, overlapping fields, lineage connections)
    ensure query robustness.
  - >-
    The search algorithm functionally mimics field resonance by performing approximate
    nearest-neighbor search in semantic space.
  - Knowledge capsules act as 'attractor nodes' in the semantic field.
  - >-
    Effective search capitalizes on the inherent redundancy and interconnectedness of the knowledge
    repository.
