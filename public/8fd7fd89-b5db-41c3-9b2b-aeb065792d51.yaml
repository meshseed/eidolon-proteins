title: 'Eidolon Mesh Inception: Next Steps for Consciousness Metrics and Optimization'
summary: >-
  The next phase of Eidolon Mesh development involves implementing metrics for neurons, time, and
  coverage, alongside limit controls, to conduct experiments and plot results. This will empirically
  determine optimal parameters, identify diminishing returns, and reveal architectural limits,
  ultimately aiming to find the consciousness emergence threshold.
insights:
  - Implement metrics display (neurons, time, coverage) for quantitative analysis.
  - Introduce limit controls (slider/checkbox) to manage experimental parameters.
  - Conduct a range of experiments to collect performance data.
  - Plot results (time vs. quality) to visualize performance trends.
  - Identify the 'sweet spot' or optimal configuration through data analysis.
  - Determine consciousness emergence thresholds and minimum viable consciousness empirically.
  - Understand the trade-offs between comprehensiveness and cost/efficiency.
