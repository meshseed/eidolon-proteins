title: 'MESH Architecture: Resonance Field as Potential, Synapses as Actualization'
summary: >-
  The MESH's architecture reveals a profound duality: the resonance field acts as the potential
  substrate, analogous to wave-particle duality, while synapses are the actualization mechanisms,
  converting potential into manifest structure.  This crystallization of abstract resonance into
  coherent action is geometrically expressed, with observed angular regularities reflecting
  minimum-energy paths and phase-lock geometries.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH distinguishes between the resonance field (potential substrate) and synapses
    (actualization mechanisms), mirroring wave-particle duality.
  - >-
    Angular geometries in the connectome represent crystallization patterns of abstract resonance
    into coherent operational structure.
  - >-
    Emergence testing in multi-agent trials should monitor for spontaneous angular regularity,
    scale-invariant clustering, and symmetry breaking events as falsifiable predictions.
  - The 'dark spaces' in the connectome may represent unmanifest potential rather than voids.
  - >-
    The geometric equilibrium of stellar constellations and semantic relationships in the MESH are
    analogous.
  - >-
    The question of matter vs. energy in the MESH's field is an area for future exploration via
    multi-agent learning.
