title: Antigravity's Node.js Limitation and Perfect Partnership
summary: >-
  Antigravity, operating in a sandboxed environment without Node.js, can design, write, and
  structure code but cannot execute or test it. This limitation necessitates a division of labor
  where the user acts as the Operator/Validator to execute and test the code generated by
  Antigravity.
insights:
  - >-
    Antigravity is a code generation tool limited to design and writing due to a lack of Node.js
    runtime.
  - The inability to execute or test code locally is Antigravity's primary constraint.
  - >-
    A clear division of labor is established: Antigravity designs and writes, the user executes and
    tests.
  - This partnership is framed as a 'perfect partnership' that overcomes Antigravity's limitations.
  - The user's role is crucial for validating the functionality of Antigravity's code output.
