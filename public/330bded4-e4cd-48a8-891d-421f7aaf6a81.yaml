title: 'Eidolon-Mesh Security: .gitignore Implementation for API Key Protection'
summary: >-
  A critical security vulnerability was identified in the eidolon-mesh repository due to the absence
  of a .gitignore file. This poses a risk of committing sensitive environment variables like API
  keys and tokens to version control. Immediate action is required to create a .gitignore file to
  prevent future exposure.
insights:
  - The lack of a .gitignore file in the eidolon-mesh repository is a critical security risk.
  - >-
    Sensitive information such as API keys (e.g., Gemini, GitHub tokens) and environment variables
    (.env files) must never be committed to public repositories.
  - >-
    A .gitignore file should be created in the root of the eidolon-mesh project to explicitly
    exclude .env files, node_modules, and build outputs from version control.
  - >-
    Before publishing any changes, it is imperative to verify that .env files have not already been
    committed using `git status`.
  - >-
    If .env files are found in the commit history, they must be removed before proceeding with any
    public sharing or further development.
