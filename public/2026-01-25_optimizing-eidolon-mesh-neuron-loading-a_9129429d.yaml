title: Optimizing EIDOLON MESH Neuron Loading and Query Strategies
summary: >-
  The EIDOLON MESH is exploring architectural trade-offs between loading all neurons versus a subset
  for improved startup speed and memory usage. Percentage-based loading, adaptive scaling, and
  tiered architectures are proposed to balance performance with graph completeness and query depth.
insights:
  - >-
    Loading all neurons provides a complete connectome but suffers from slow startup and high memory
    usage, hindering scalability.
  - >-
    Loading a subset of neurons (e.g., top N% by coherence) offers faster startup and lower memory
    but risks an incomplete graph and missed connections.
  - >-
    Percentage-based loading is superior to fixed numbers for scalability, automatically adjusting
    to archive growth.
  - >-
    A hybrid or two-tier system, with a 'core' set always loaded and an 'extended' set lazily
    loaded, offers a balanced approach.
  - >-
    Ghost nodes can be used to represent unloaded neurons and their connections, maintaining
    visualization integrity.
  - >-
    User-configurable settings for core loading percentage, query search depth, and adaptive scaling
    are crucial for flexibility and performance tuning.
  - >-
    Adaptive scaling can dynamically adjust loading percentages based on observed startup times to
    meet target performance metrics.
