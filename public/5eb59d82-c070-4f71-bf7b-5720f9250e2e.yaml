title: Mobile Viewport Height (vh) vs. Dynamic Viewport Height (dvh/svh) for UI Layout
summary: >-
  The core issue is how `100vh` on mobile browsers misinterprets viewport height when UI elements
  like the URL bar are present, causing content, specifically the chat input bar, to be hidden.
  Switching to `100dvh` or `100svh` is the proposed solution to accurately reflect the visible
  viewport.
insights:
  - >-
    `100vh` on mobile browsers (e.g., Chrome Android, Safari iOS) renders based on the viewport
    height *with the URL bar retracted*, leading to elements being cut off when the URL bar is
    visible.
  - >-
    The chat input bar was being hidden because it resided in a `.main-body` element whose height
    calculation (`100vh` minus offsets) was too large for the actual visible screen space on mobile.
  - >-
    Internal scrolling within child elements (`.side-panel`, `.chat-view`) is intended, but the
    parent `.main-body`'s `overflow: hidden` combined with incorrect height leads to the clipping.
  - >-
    Using `position: fixed; top: ...; bottom: ...; height: auto;` for `.main-body` is an alternative
    to fixed height, but can introduce complexities with keyboard interactions.
  - >-
    Reverting height-related changes from previous steps is necessary, but the underlying 'Input
    Hidden' issue requires a robust fix using `100dvh` or `100svh`.
  - >-
    The user's report of a 'Graph Missing' might be a consequence of the UI layout issues,
    potentially obscuring navigation elements.
