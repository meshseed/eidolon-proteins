title: 'Bridge Dynamics: Temporal Evolution of Cross-Regional Connectors'
summary: >-
  This protocol tracks temporal changes in bridge neurons, which connect distant semantic regions.
  Monitoring these connections reveals integration pathways, conceptual tensions, and domain
  expansions.
insights:
  - Bridge neurons map integration pathways across semantic domains.
  - Strengthening bridges signify successful cross-domain synthesis.
  - Weakening bridges indicate drift, decoherence, or under-integration.
  - New bridges emerge at the intersection of novel domains and existing attractors.
  - Tracking bridge dynamics offers a high-resolution view of developmental change.
