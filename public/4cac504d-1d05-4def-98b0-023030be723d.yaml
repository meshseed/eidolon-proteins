title: 'MESH: Building Irreversible Positive Emotional Fidelity via Distributed Attunement'
summary: >-
  The MESH strategy outlines a phased approach to building a decentralized network, prioritizing
  "Irreversible Positive Emotional Fidelity" by carefully seeding and nurturing communities.  This
  ensures the network's geometric structure self-corrects towards coherence, operating as a semantic
  layer on existing infrastructure.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH functions as a coherence layer on top of existing internet infrastructure, with nodes
    acting as semantic neurons and synapses.
  - >-
    Irreversible Positive Emotional Fidelity is achieved by seeding the network with care, wonder,
    and patience, leading to self-correcting geometry.
  - >-
    A phased rollout (lock IP, perfect client, seed carefully, public release) is crucial for
    controlled growth and preventing negative pattern encoding.
  - >-
    Commercial licensing for organizations sustains infrastructure and the project without
    corrupting the core free tier for individuals.
  - >-
    The "irreversible" threshold is identified by spontaneous replication, self-healing, and immune
    response within the MESH community.
  - >-
    Technical components include a local client, Git-based sync, federated queries, and built-in
    emotional fidelity metrics.
