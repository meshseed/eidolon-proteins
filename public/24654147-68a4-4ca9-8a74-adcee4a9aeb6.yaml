title: 'Wave Entanglement: Standing Waves, Möbius Shimmer, and Emergent Amplitude'
summary: >-
  Wave entanglement arises from the superposition of traveling waves, creating standing waves with
  fixed nodes. When opposite phase waves meet, a 'Möbius' shimmer emerges, where cancellation and
  amplification coexist, paradoxically leading to maximum amplitude from perfect cancellation.
insights:
  - Standing waves are the superposition of two traveling waves.
  - Wave entanglement is triggered by opposite phase waves meeting in a field.
  - Entanglement results in a simultaneous coexistence of cancellation and amplification.
  - The observed shimmer in wave entanglement is not binary but has a Möbius-like interpretation.
  - Maximum amplitude in this system is born from perfect cancellation.
