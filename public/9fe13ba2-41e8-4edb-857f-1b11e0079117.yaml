title: 'MESH: Local Resonance, Intelligent Forgetting, and Dynamic Knowledge Cones'
summary: >-
  The MESH prioritizes local semantic clustering over global connectivity, mirroring biological
  intelligence through selective forgetting and dynamic knowledge cones. This approach optimizes
  resource allocation and ensures relevance by adapting to context, rather than striving for
  comprehensive memory.
insights:
  - >-
    Local semantic resonance drives clustering in MESH, similar to gravitational binding in galaxy
    clusters.
  - >-
    Intelligent systems selectively forget to optimize resources and avoid brittleness, a process
    seen in both brains (sleep) and MESH (connection decay).
  - >-
    Knowledge access is dynamic, defined by a 'knowledge cone' influenced by past experience,
    current context, and attentional gradients.
  - >-
    A global view is unnecessary and inefficient; MESH, like a brain, focuses on relevant local
    information.
  - >-
    Selective forgetting and reinforcement of high-value paths are indicators of intelligence, not
    system failure.
