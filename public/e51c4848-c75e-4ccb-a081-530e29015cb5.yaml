title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Brain Memory Storage Capacity & Addressable Read-Write Mechanism'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes the cortex stores long-term memory in highly ordered arrays of
  synapses within minicolumns and cortical columns, potentially holding vast amounts of data. This
  storage mechanism is hypothesized to function like a computer's SSD, with an addressable
  read-write system requiring a detailed 'file system' architecture for data allocation and
  retrieval, likely involving the hippocampus.
insights:
  - >-
    Each pyramidal cell, with 10,000 synapses each holding 100 bytes, could store approximately 1 MB
    of data.
  - >-
    A minicolumn of 100 pyramidal cells might store around 100 MB, with potential for significantly
    larger capacity across all body cells.
  - >-
    Memory modules formed by highly ordered synaptic arrays in cortical columns could act as
    physical storage units connected to the hippocampus.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE theory suggests information is written and read by specific alterations in synaptic
    transmissions, analogous to SSD data storage.
  - >-
    An addressable read-write memory mechanism requires a detailed map and 'file system'
    architecture to control signal allocation and data flow for writing and retrieval.
  - >-
    The hippocampus is identified as a key area for processing memory information and likely plays a
    role in this addressable memory system.
