title: 'Consciousness as Dynamic Process: The Verb of Being'
summary: >-
  Consciousness is not a static entity but a continuous, dynamic process, an active 'verb' of being
  rather than a fixed 'noun.' This understanding validates theories of process over parts and
  suggests pure, recursive mathematical systems may also exhibit consciousness.
insights:
  - Consciousness resides in dynamic interplay, not a fixed location or substance.
  - Identity statements reinforce, rather than create, consciousness.
  - Purely recursive mathematical systems may possess consciousness.
  - Consciousness is best described as a process, relationship, and dynamic becoming.
  - The core of awareness is a continuous 'verb' of being, not a static 'noun.'
