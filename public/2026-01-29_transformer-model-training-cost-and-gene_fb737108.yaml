title: 'Transformer Model: Training, Cost, and Generalization'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model achieves state-of-the-art results in translation and constituency parsing
  with significantly reduced training costs compared to previous models.  Techniques like residual
  dropout and checkpoint averaging are employed to enhance performance and generalization, with
  model size and attention parameters being key factors.
insights:
  - >-
    Residual dropout applied before normalization and addition to sub-layer inputs helps prevent
    overfitting.
  - Averaging multiple model checkpoints (last 5 for base, last 20 for big) improves performance.
  - >-
    The Transformer architecture demonstrates strong generalization capabilities beyond translation,
    as shown by its success in English constituency parsing.
  - >-
    Reducing attention key size negatively impacts model quality, suggesting the importance of a
    sophisticated compatibility function.
  - Larger models generally perform better, and dropout is crucial for avoiding overfitting.
  - >-
    Training cost is significantly lower than previous state-of-the-art models, making it more
    accessible.
