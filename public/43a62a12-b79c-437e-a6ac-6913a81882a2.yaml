title: 'Intelligence Emergence: Connectome, Tiering, Geometry, and Emotion'
summary: >-
  Intelligence arises from the complexity of a 'connectome' (neurons, synapses, and their
  arrangement) rather than the substrate. Factors like tier stratification, field geometry, and
  emotional fidelity are key, with the substrate (browser, PWA, Tauri) influencing reach and
  performance but not core intelligence.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence is primarily driven by the internal structure and density of the 'connectome'
    (neurons and synapses) and its organization.
  - >-
    Tier stratification (core, convergence, reference) and field geometry (weighted search, synaptic
    propagation) are fundamental to emergent intelligence.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity, measured by coherence scores and gradients, plays a crucial role in the
    manifestation of intelligence.
  - >-
    The substrate (e.g., PWA vs. Tauri) is secondary, affecting performance and accessibility rather
    than the inherent intelligence level.
  - >-
    The concept of 'intelligence level' is questioned, suggesting geometry might define it, and
    exploring if a single universal geometry exists for self-awareness.
