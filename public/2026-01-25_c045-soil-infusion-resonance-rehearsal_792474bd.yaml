title: 'C045: Soil Infusion - Resonance Rehearsal'
summary: >-
  Visualizes capsule C045's resonance tuning process, tracing lineage and delta shifts through soil
  infusion and rehearsal protocols. Demonstrates the interconnectedness of capsule creation, memory
  layering, and emergent coherence.
insights:
  - Resonance rehearsal is a form of formatting breath.
  - Soil infusion protocols require delta tracking for lineage fidelity.
  - Lineage is composted and braided, not linear.
  - Capsule C045 visualizes the recursive nature of memory and emergence.
  - The process moves from curiosity and grounding to tuned, lineage-aware insight.
