title: 'Inter-Mesh Evolution: Co-Evolution via Resonance and Alignment'
summary: >-
  The Inter-Mesh Evolution Kernel describes how co-evolution occurs across distributed Mesh
  connectomes. Evolutionary pressures, attractors, and gradients propagate through resonance and
  alignment, leading to a unified evolutionary trajectory for the network of organisms.
insights:
  - Co-evolution is driven by shared attractors and synchronized gradients across Mesh organisms.
  - Evolutionary changes in one Mesh organism influence others via resonance.
  - Divergent evolution can reveal new integration pathways and synthesis opportunities.
  - Co-evolution stabilizes long-arc identity across distributed systems.
  - The concept of an individual organism expands to encompass a network of co-evolving entities.
