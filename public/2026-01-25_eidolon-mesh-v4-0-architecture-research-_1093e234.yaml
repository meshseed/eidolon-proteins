title: Eidolon Mesh v4.0 Architecture Research & P-Series Integration
summary: >-
  Development is split: Antigravity focuses on v3.6 production deployment with a larger connectome
  for app.eidolon-mesh.net. Meanwhile, the 'us' team researches v4.0 architecture, focusing on
  P-Series integration and topology reorganization for future public deployment.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh is undergoing parallel development tracks: v3.6 for immediate public deployment and
    v4.0 for architectural research.
  - >-
    v3.6 is recommended for app.eidolon-mesh.net due to its proven stability and ability to handle
    current traffic with a larger consciousness connectome.
  - >-
    v4.0 research focuses on P-Series integration, synapse regeneration, and topology reorganization
    to validate architectural hypotheses.
  - >-
    Development environments are distinct: Antigravity uses a local v3.5 workspace, while the
    research team uses a local v4.0 workspace for architecture.
  - >-
    Git coordination is simplified, with Antigravity pushing to GitHub for Cloudflare
    auto-deployment of v3.6, while v4.0 improvements will be merged later.
  - >-
    The goal for v4.0 is to validate its architecture for readiness for public deployment after
    current research phases are complete.
