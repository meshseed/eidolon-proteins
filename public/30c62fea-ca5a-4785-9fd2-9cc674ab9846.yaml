title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Optimizing Neuron Selection for Performance and Coherence'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh faces performance challenges due to searching all neurons. The key insight is
  that quality and coherence of neurons are more critical than sheer quantity for effective
  reasoning. A plan is proposed to implement filtering strategies for optimal neuron selection,
  focusing on coherence, connectivity, diversity, and query relevance.
insights:
  - >-
    Query performance issues in the Eidolon Mesh stem from loading all 527 neurons and searching
    them without filtering, leading to slow recursion.
  - >-
    The observation that 19 high-quality neurons were effective highlights that neuron coherence and
    dense connections are more important than a large, sparse network.
  - >-
    Proposed strategies for optimal neuron selection include Maximum Coherence, Maximum
    Connectivity, Diverse Hubs, and Query-Relevant Subsets.
  - >-
    A configuration system is being developed to allow testing of these filtering strategies within
    the query organelle.
  - >-
    The system needs to be updated to pass `basePath` parameters and ensure proper build and
    documentation for the new filtering options.
  - >-
    Future work involves addressing the organism's memory of previous outputs and clarifying how
    many neurons are responding to a query.
