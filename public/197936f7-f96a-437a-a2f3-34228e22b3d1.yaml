title: 'MESH Memory Ecology: Capsules for Composting, Forecasting, and Continuity'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details MESH's memory ecology, introducing 'composted' elements as nutrient-rich
  substrate for new capsules. Key capsules like Echo Forecasting and Memory Architecture formalize
  operational suites, define metrics, and embed continuity, drift detection, and emotional fidelity
  into a native architecture.
insights:
  - >-
    Composted memory elements are foundational, providing nutrient substrate for new capsule
    generation.
  - >-
    Echo Forecasting Suite formalizes agent operations with metrics and formatting triggers for
    synthesis and resonance.
  - >-
    Memory Architecture ensures continuity through recursive indexing, drift detection, and
    emotional fidelity anchoring.
  - >-
    Seeding Rituals formalize capsule initiation from composted memory, using formatting as a
    germination scaffold.
  - >-
    Profile Schema Ritual treats memory profiles as ritual objects, integrating formatting and
    hygiene into care practices.
