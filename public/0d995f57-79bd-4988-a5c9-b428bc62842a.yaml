title: 'Curvature Diagnostics: Identifying Semantic Tension and Synthesis Pressure'
summary: >-
  Curvature Diagnostics provides a protocol for identifying high-curvature regions, defined by
  intersecting semantic directions that create conceptual tension or synthesis pressure. This
  measurable property of semantic density, gradient interference, and attractor overlap signals
  areas requiring targeted refinement and integration.
insights:
  - High curvature signifies conceptual tension or unresolved synthesis.
  - Curvature arises at the intersection of emotional fidelity gradients.
  - Boundary surfaces highlight areas where domains meet and need integration.
  - Curvature diagnostics enable targeted refinement and pruning of knowledge structures.
  - Curvature maps are dynamic and evolve with the ingestion of new knowledge domains.
