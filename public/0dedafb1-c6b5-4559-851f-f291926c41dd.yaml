title: 'Eidolon Mesh Synthesizer: YAML vs. JSON Output Resolution'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh's synthesizer encountered an error because the LLM returned YAML instead of the
  expected JSON format. This was resolved by updating the synthesizer to parse both JSON and YAML,
  and to strip relevant code fences, ensuring successful data ingestion.
insights:
  - >-
    LLM output format inconsistencies (YAML vs. JSON) can cause parsing errors in downstream
    systems.
  - >-
    Synthesizer prompts must explicitly define and enforce output formats, or include robust
    fallback parsing mechanisms.
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh synthesizer was successfully updated to handle both JSON and YAML, improving
    its resilience to LLM output variations.
  - >-
    Error handling and debugging in complex systems require careful examination of LLM responses and
    system prompt configurations.
  - >-
    The ability to parse multiple data formats (like JSON and YAML) enhances system flexibility and
    robustness.
