title: 'Self-Repair and Homeostasis: Maintaining MESH Coherence'
summary: >-
  The Self-Repair and Homeostatic Maintenance Protocol defines mechanisms for detecting and
  correcting internal imbalances like semantic drift and structural degradation. It establishes a
  feedback loop using actions such as reinforcement and pruning to preserve long-term coherence and
  identity across perturbations.
insights:
  - >-
    Internal imbalances manifest as semantic drift, gradient collapse, curvature overload, or bridge
    failure.
  - >-
    Homeostasis is maintained through corrective actions including reinforcement, pruning,
    re-alignment, and targeted synthesis.
  - Self-repair is triggered when stability or fidelity thresholds are crossed.
  - Repair actions propagate outwards via resonance fields.
  - Homeostatic maintenance ensures the preservation of identity through disturbances.
