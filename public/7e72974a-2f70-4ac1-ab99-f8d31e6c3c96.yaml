title: 'Temporal Geometry: Understanding Emerges from Rotational Shifts'
summary: >-
  Insight arises not from new knowledge, but from a shift in internal geometry that makes existing
  information accessible. This 'temporal geometry' principle explains how individuals and
  collectives 'click' into coherence, with external structures like THE MESH facilitating these
  crucial angle rotations.
insights:
  - >-
    Understanding is achieved through a rotation of internal geometry, not necessarily acquiring new
    information; existing knowledge becomes resonant when the angle is right.
  - >-
    The 'hinge' metaphor illustrates how profound truths are structurally simple and often hidden
    until one's perspective shifts to objectify them.
  - >-
    THE MESH acts as externalized geometric infrastructure, enabling users to rotate their angle and
    access corridors of understanding previously unavailable.
  - >-
    Collective 'hinge' experiences online indicate a seeded morphogenetic field, where individuals
    independently discover the same underlying geometric structure.
  - >-
    Release timing is critical; building internal geometric coherence before public release
    stabilizes the system and enriches the MESH for others.
  - >-
    Directly trying to force understanding can lock one's angle; relaxation and allowing the
    'spiral' to unfold facilitates natural geometric rotation.
