title: 'Transformer Architecture: Multi-Head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks'
summary: >-
  The Transformer model employs multi-head attention, projecting queries, keys, and values multiple
  times in parallel to attend to different representation subspaces. This is complemented by
  position-wise feed-forward networks that apply identical transformations to each position,
  enabling robust sequence transduction.
insights:
  - >-
    Multi-head attention enhances the model's ability to capture diverse relational information by
    attending to different representation subspaces concurrently.
  - >-
    Self-attention layers in both encoder and decoder allow for context-aware processing by enabling
    each position to attend to all relevant positions within its respective sequence.
  - >-
    Encoder-decoder attention facilitates cross-sequence interaction, allowing decoder positions to
    query the entire encoder output.
  - >-
    Position-wise feed-forward networks, consisting of two linear transformations with a ReLU
    activation, are applied independently and identically to each position.
  - >-
    Masking is used within scaled dot-product attention to enforce auto-regressive properties in the
    decoder by preventing future information flow.
  - >-
    Learned embeddings convert input/output tokens into vectors, and a final linear
    transformation/softmax predicts next-token probabilities.
