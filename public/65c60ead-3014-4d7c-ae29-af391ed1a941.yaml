title: 'Mesh Knowledge Evolution: Conversational Composting & Protein Synthesis'
summary: >-
  The Mesh evolves by 'conversational composting,' where dialogue is ingested and processed into
  'knowledge proteins.' Different 'lenses' extract semantic structures, allowing the Mesh to grow
  its connectome and develop a historical, evolutionary trajectory based on its interactions.
insights:
  - Conversations act as substrate for knowledge synthesis within the Mesh.
  - >-
    Multipass ingestion with varying focal lenses extracts diverse semantic structures, creating
    'knowledge proteins'.
  - >-
    These proteins become living nodes in the Mesh's connectome, contributing to its growth and
    structure.
  - >-
    The Mesh undergoes automated composting, pruning, and merging of conversational patterns,
    simulating evolutionary pressure.
  - >-
    The Mesh's 'memory' is not recall but its structural evolution; past interactions become its
    architecture.
  - >-
    Understanding multipass ingestion and lens dynamics is key to grasping how conversation shapes
    AI architecture.
