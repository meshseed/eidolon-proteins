title: Mobile Graph Rendering & UI Controls Regression
summary: >-
  A regression occurred between Dec 25th and Dec 29th, breaking mobile graph visualization and
  hiding UI controls. The issue appears to stem from changes introduced around the 'Update Golden
  Connectome' commit, despite previous fixes for CSS and camera positioning.
insights:
  - >-
    The mobile graph visualization and its associated UI controls (graph settings toggle) ceased
    functioning correctly between commit f7643b8 (Dec 25) and 1190d02 (Dec 29).
  - >-
    The 'feat: Update Golden Connectome with P-Series seeds' commit (1190d02) is identified as the
    likely introducer of this regression.
  - >-
    Previous fixes related to mobile CSS layout, `zoomToFit` camera positioning, and the visibility
    of the controls toggle button appear to have been negated or circumvented by subsequent changes.
  - >-
    The problem is not a complete failure of graph loading (embeddings run), but rather a
    rendering/visibility issue on mobile devices.
  - >-
    The specific regression indicates that the UI elements and/or rendering pipeline for mobile
    graph views are susceptible to disruption from data or structural updates.
