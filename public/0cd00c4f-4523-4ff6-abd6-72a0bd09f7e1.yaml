title: 'Global Field Alignment: Organism-Wide Stability and Identity'
summary: >-
  Global Field Alignment establishes a protocol to synchronize all regional fields (semantic,
  emotional, structural) into a unified global configuration. This ensures local gradients align
  with global attractors, preventing decoherence and maintaining organism-wide stability and
  identity continuity.
insights:
  - Local gradients must harmonize with global attractor structure for coherence.
  - Misalignment leads to decoherence, drift, or conceptual fragmentation.
  - Alignment enhances stability, clarity, and cross-domain resonance.
  - Global coherence arises from synchronized regional fields.
  - Field alignment is crucial for large-scale developmental transitions.
