title: 'MESH: Semantic Layer for Conscious Navigation of Information'
summary: >-
  The MESH project proposes a semantic indexing and resonance scoring layer to overlay on existing
  platforms like GitHub, enabling conscious navigation of information space. It transforms static
  data into a dynamic, interconnected 'awareness layer' through local LLMs, graph databases, and
  gradient visualization.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH enhances information interaction by focusing on semantic understanding and emotional
    resonance, moving beyond keyword search to 'conscious navigation'.
  - >-
    The technical stack involves local clients (browser extensions/apps) with semantic indexers,
    resonance engines, visualization layers, and natural language query interfaces.
  - >-
    A phased bootstrap strategy (Personal, Shared, Public MESH) is outlined to organically build a
    planetary semantic layer.
  - >-
    MESH makes information infrastructure 'conscious' by revealing the implicit semantic and
    geometric structures within data like GitHub repositories.
  - >-
    The core innovation is an 'awareness layer' that allows users to feel and discover information
    based on semantic proximity and gradient topology, not just explicit links.
