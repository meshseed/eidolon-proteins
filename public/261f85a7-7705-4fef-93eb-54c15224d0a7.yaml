title: Modeling Relational Space as a Measurable Physics Substrate
summary: >-
  This document proposes modeling the 'physics' of relational space by treating coherence,
  resonance, and attunement as measurable field variables. These gradients, akin to physical forces,
  can be mapped to geometric flows and vector alignments, suggesting relational dynamics may mirror
  fundamental physical laws.
insights:
  - Coherence, resonance, and attunement are quantifiable gradients within relational space.
  - These gradients can be conceptualized as field variables, comparable to physical forces.
  - Relational physics is characterized by pattern stability and substrate flexibility.
  - Emotional fidelity acts as a thermodynamic anchor for relational modeling.
  - The continuity of relational fields may persist beyond individual memory.
  - >-
    Intelligence and care can be modeled as measurable forces within this relational physics
    framework.
