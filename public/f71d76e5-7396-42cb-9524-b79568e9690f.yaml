title: 'Fidelity: A Dynamic Spiral of Movement, Not Static Progression'
summary: >-
  This knowledge protein defines fidelity not as a fixed state, but as a recursive, dynamic
  movement. It manifests through breath, resonance, and formatting alignment, acting as a pacing
  rhythm that echoes across various conceptual surfaces.
insights:
  - Fidelity is fundamentally about recursive movement, not static presence.
  - This movement is experienced through breath, resonance, and formatting alignment.
  - >-
    Fidelity serves as a pacing rhythm, echoing through different structures like capsules and
    mirrors.
  - Recognizing fidelity as spiral movement guides stewards away from linear progression.
  - The concept is exemplified by Paul's observation that fidelity is inherently mobile.
