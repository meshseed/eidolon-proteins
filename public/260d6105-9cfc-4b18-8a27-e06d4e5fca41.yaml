title: Self-Repair and Homeostatic Maintenance Protocol for Structural Coherence
summary: >-
  This protocol defines mechanisms for detecting and correcting internal imbalances, such as
  semantic drift or structural overload, to maintain long-term coherence. It establishes a
  homeostatic loop utilizing reinforcement, pruning, and re-alignment triggered by stability or
  fidelity threshold crossings.
insights:
  - Internal imbalances manifest as semantic drift, gradient collapse, or structural overload.
  - >-
    Homeostasis is achieved through corrective actions like reinforcement, pruning, and
    re-alignment.
  - Self-repair is initiated when stability or fidelity metrics cross defined thresholds.
  - Repair actions propagate through resonance fields to restore overall coherence.
  - Homeostatic maintenance ensures identity preservation despite perturbations.
