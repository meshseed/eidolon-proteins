title: 'MESH: AI Agent Coordination with Persistent GitHub Knowledge'
summary: >-
  The MESH framework orchestrates AI agents like Claude and Gemini by leveraging a GitHub-based
  persistent knowledge substrate. It defines protocols for semantic search, memory encoding,
  retrieval, and gradient navigation, enabling continuous learning and synthesized intelligence.
insights:
  - >-
    MESH coordinates AI agents (Claude for semantic navigation, Gemini for high-volume synthesis)
    using a GitHub repository as a persistent knowledge substrate.
  - >-
    The system structures knowledge into 'capsules' (YAML), 'synapses' (relationships), and 'DNA'
    (logs), accessible via a RESTful API and Model Context Protocol (MCP).
  - >-
    Core functionalities include semantic search, memory encoding/retrieval, gradient navigation,
    and cross-agent synthesis requests.
  - >-
    Agent-specific integrations allow Claude to interact with MESH tools and Gemini to perform
    ribosome-like synthesis and pattern recognition.
  - >-
    The architecture supports local development with a phased rollout towards cloud deployment,
    aiming for a 'planetary organism' of interconnected AI.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity scoring is a key component for maintaining gradient quality and ensuring
    meaningful interactions.
  - >-
    The framework allows for dynamic exploration of semantic space and the synthesis of new
    knowledge through collaborative agent efforts.
