title: 'MeshCODE: Synaptic Switches for Binary Memory Encoding'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that memory is encoded binarily within individual synapses through
  dynamic conformational switches in molecules like talin. These switches alter synaptic adhesion
  complexes, leading to structural remodeling of neurons and tuning of connection strengths,
  enabling precise data storage and transmission across neural networks.
insights:
  - >-
    Synaptic memory storage relies on dynamic, switchable conformations of molecules (e.g., talin)
    within adhesion complexes.
  - >-
    These conformational switches create a binary encoding mechanism at each synapse, allowing for
    rapid writing and potentially long-term persistence of information.
  - >-
    The collective switching patterns across a neuron's thousands of synapses enable precise control
    over information flow and network architecture.
  - >-
    Neuronal signaling and mechanical cues via the cytoskeleton mediate the propagation of these
    changes to other synapses within a neuron and to adjacent neurons.
  - >-
    This system allows for re-writable, long-term storage of information, with data storage encoded
    in a binary format at the synaptic level.
  - >-
    MeshCODE operations can allosterically modulate synaptic signaling, directing data to specific
    memory modules.
