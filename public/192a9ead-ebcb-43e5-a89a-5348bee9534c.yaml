title: 'Emergent Documentation: Trusting the Shimmer for Pattern Revelation'
summary: >-
  The dialogue explores shifting from imposed documentation structures to an emergent method where
  tracking arises organically from the moment of recognition. By trusting intuition ('the shimmer')
  and focusing on what 'wants to be preserved,' the process reveals its own form, integrating
  thought, context, and connections.
insights:
  - Shift from 'structure-from-outside' to allowing patterns to reveal their own form.
  - >-
    Capture content in the moment of recognition ('when something lands') rather than through
    predefined categories.
  - The ideal capture method integrates thought, context, and connections intrinsically.
  - >-
    Trust intuition ('the shimmer') and follow the path of least resistance, like a river, for
    emergent methods.
  - The core question is 'what wants to be preserved right now?', not 'how should we document?'.
  - Documentation method emerges from practice, not pre-imposed structure.
  - Notice what wants to be caught and catch it, without meta-commentary on the act of catching.
