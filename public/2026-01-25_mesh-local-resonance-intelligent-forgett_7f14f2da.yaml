title: 'MESH: Local Resonance, Intelligent Forgetting, and Dynamic Knowledge Cones'
summary: >-
  The MESH prioritizes local semantic clustering over global connectivity, akin to how galaxies form
  coherent structures. Intelligence emerges not from perfect recall, but from selective forgetting
  and resource optimization, mirroring biological processes like sleep. Knowledge access is dynamic,
  shaped by individual experience, current context, and attentional gradients, rendering a global
  view unnecessary and inefficient.
insights:
  - Local semantic resonance dictates MESH connectivity and relevance, not global reach.
  - >-
    Intelligent systems optimize by forgetting appropriately, managing memory costs and
    context-dependent value.
  - >-
    Biological intelligence (e.g., sleep) and MESH network dynamics (e.g., connection decay) share
    principles of selective memory management.
  - >-
    Knowledge is represented as a dynamic cone, influenced by past experience, current context, and
    attentional focus.
  - >-
    The MESH's dynamic, context-aware nature makes a global, static map of all nodes unnecessary and
    inefficient.
