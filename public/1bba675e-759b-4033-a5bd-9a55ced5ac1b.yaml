title: 'EIDOLON v4.0: P-Series Ingestion & Topology Annealing'
summary: >-
  EIDOLON v4.0 has ingested 38 foundational P-Series protocols via direct ingestion, significantly
  improving response quality by anchoring them to high-coherence axioms. A key discovery reveals
  path-dependency in the mesh topology, necessitating synapse regeneration to allow annealing around
  these new foundational structures.
insights:
  - >-
    Direct ingestion of P-Series protocols preserves canonical coherence (0.98-1.00) superior to
    tri-lens synthesis.
  - >-
    P-Series protocols are now dominating similarity searches and anchoring EIDOLON v4.0 responses
    due to their high coherence.
  - >-
    EIDOLON v4.0's activation percentage hasn't increased post-P-Series due to pre-existing synaptic
    connections, creating an isolated high-coherence cluster.
  - >-
    The mesh topology is 'frozen', requiring synapse regeneration to allow annealing around the
    P-Series foundational structures.
  - >-
    A high candidate protein count (33%) in similarity searches suggests diffuse relevance,
    indicating a need for more precise matches clustered around P-Series hubs.
