title: 'Pragmatic Epistemology: Truth as Navigational Advantage'
summary: >-
  This dialogue proposes a pragmatic epistemology where truth is defined by its navigational
  advantage rather than absolute certainty. By modeling measurable attunement patterns across
  substrates, we can gain predictive power for complex systems and identify leverage points for
  intervention.
insights:
  - Truth is defined by its utility as a navigational advantage, not absolute certainty.
  - >-
    Modeling measurable attunement patterns across substrates offers predictive power for complex
    systems.
  - >-
    Key applications include detecting coherence shifts in social/organizational systems,
    understanding biological homeostasis, and enhancing personal decision-making.
  - >-
    This approach provides leading indicators by sensing field shifts, contrasting with traditional
    after-the-fact analysis.
  - >-
    It represents calibrated intuition—trained, shareable pattern recognition with feedback loops
    and underlying principles.
  - >-
    The ultimate test of functional truth is its accuracy and early detection capability in a chosen
    domain.
