title: Perturbation Modeling and Resilience Analysis Protocol
summary: >-
  This protocol simulates perturbations like new domain ingestion or conceptual collisions to
  analyze an organism's resilience. It identifies sensitive regions, stability cores, and the role
  of emotional fidelity in maintaining structural integrity during change.
insights:
  - Perturbations reveal structural weaknesses and resilience cores.
  - High-curvature zones are most sensitive to conceptual collisions.
  - Stability cores anchor the organism during rapid change.
  - Emotional fidelity acts as a shock absorber across the manifold.
  - Perturbation modeling supports adaptive refinement and pruning.
