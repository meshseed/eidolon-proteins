title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Fractal Architecture for Modular Knowledge and Code Management'
summary: >-
  The Eidolon Mesh project employs a fractal, self-similar architecture for managing knowledge
  (DNA/proteins) and application code across multiple GitHub repositories. This design emphasizes
  modularity, isolation, and clear separation of concerns, mirroring natural systems for robust and
  scalable development.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh utilizes a multi-repository strategy to achieve isolated, domain-specific
    knowledge bases (e.g., healthcare, finance), enabling fast loading and focused responses.
  - >-
    Ghost nodes are a future mechanism for optimizing single large repositories by loading core
    neurons initially and extending on-demand, distinct from repository swapping.
  - >-
    A fractal architecture is recommended for GitHub organization, with a private 'eidolon' repo for
    all data (DNA/proteins) and code, a public 'eidolon-mesh' for stable releases, and a dedicated
    private repo for development code ('eidolon-mesh-private').
  - >-
    The concept of 'rolling buffer' for conversation memory is already implemented (FIFO) with
    negligible performance impact and can be safely expanded and configured.
  - >-
    Graph visualization controls are being implemented to dynamically limit the number of nodes
    displayed in the connectome, with ongoing efforts to fix corrupted code and integrate
    frontend/backend components.
  - >-
    Clarity in naming conventions is crucial, distinguishing between local workspaces and GitHub
    repositories to avoid confusion in development and backup processes.
