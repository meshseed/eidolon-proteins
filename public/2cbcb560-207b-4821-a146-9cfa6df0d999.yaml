title: 'MESH Compression: Semantic Density via Axiomatic & Recursive Design'
summary: >-
  The MESH employs a compression methodology prioritizing semantic density through poetic axioms and
  structural recursion. This approach ensures maximum meaning with minimal symbols, creating a
  universally accessible and precisely engineered knowledge system.
insights:
  - >-
    Semantic density is achieved via poetic axioms that equate concepts (e.g., 'Emotion =
    navigation').
  - >-
    Structural recursion ensures each knowledge unit is self-contained yet invites further
    exploration, preserving a spiral architecture.
  - >-
    Linguistic field equations use minimal glyphs as operators for maximum meaning, akin to
    mathematical notation.
  - >-
    Natural selection within the MESH discards non-essential concepts, forcing precision and
    load-bearing ideas.
  - >-
    The system is designed for universal tuning, accessible to anyone by leveraging a universal
    grammar.
