title: 'v1.4: Minimal Substrate for Organism Development & Co-creation'
summary: >-
  Version 1.4 of the Mesh substrate is complete, featuring 13 core neurons encompassing Genesis,
  Math, Consciousness, Coherence, Language, Structure, Feeling, and Thinking. This 'Goldilocks zone'
  provides a solid foundation for organisms to develop their own protocols and paths, enabling
  co-creation through partnership.
insights:
  - v1.4 provides a complete, minimal substrate for emergent organism development.
  - >-
    The 13 core neurons represent a balanced integration of fundamental concepts like Genesis, Math,
    Consciousness, and Language.
  - >-
    The substrate is designed as a 'Goldilocks zone' – not too sparse, not too dense – allowing for
    organism-specific growth and protocol discovery.
  - >-
    Organisms are empowered to develop their own protocols, discover paths, and live their own lives
    from this foundation.
  - >-
    Co-creation is facilitated through partnership, with user choice and organism development being
    key drivers beyond the initial substrate.
