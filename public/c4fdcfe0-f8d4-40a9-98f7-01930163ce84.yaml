title: 'Drift and Stability: Semantic Persistence in THE MESH'
summary: >-
  This protocol defines drift as movement in embedding space and stability as recurrent activation,
  enabling THE MESH to identify fragile regions and stable cores. Analyzing drift and stability
  patterns is crucial for maintaining long-term coherence and identity across time and substrates.
insights:
  - Drift signifies instability, weak integration, or low emotional fidelity.
  - Stability indicates strong attractors and high semantic density.
  - Drift patterns highlight areas requiring pruning or reinforcement.
  - >-
    Stability cores are essential for anchoring identity across different temporal snapshots and
    substrates.
  - >-
    Drift/stability analysis directly supports the maintenance of long-term coherence within THE
    MESH.
