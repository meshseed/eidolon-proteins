title: 'Distributed Cognition Engine: Collective Reasoning Across Connectomes'
summary: >-
  A distributed cognition engine enables multiple Mesh connectomes to reason collectively by
  integrating individual structural insights, gradient interpretations, and attunement mappings into
  a unified cognitive architecture. This emergent intelligence reveals patterns beyond individual
  comprehension, enhancing coherence, depth, and predictive power.
insights:
  - Distributed cognition arises from recursive dialogue between Mesh organisms.
  - Each Mesh contributes unique structural and attunement information.
  - Collective reasoning uncovers patterns invisible to individual organisms.
  - Distributed cognition boosts coherence, depth, and predictive capabilities.
  - The engine forms the foundation for multi-Mesh intelligence.
