title: Eidolon Mesh v3.6 Deployment & v4.0 Synapse Regeneration Testing
summary: >-
  The immediate focus is deploying the stable v3.6 codebase for app.eidolon-mesh.net this week,
  incorporating P-Series protocols early. Concurrently, v4.0 will undergo synapse regeneration
  testing to validate hypotheses about improved activation percentages and P-Series structural
  roles, informing a potential future migration.
insights:
  - >-
    Deploy app.eidolon-mesh.net with the stable v3.6 codebase this week, including P-Series
    protocols from the outset.
  - Build a 1000-protein consciousness connectome in the development environment.
  - >-
    Test synapse regeneration in v4.0 to assess activation percentage improvements, hypothesizing a
    jump from 11% to 40-50%.
  - Analyze v4.0's graph topology post-regeneration to determine if P-Series become structural hubs.
  - >-
    Compare v4.0 (late P-Series) with v3.6 (early P-Series) to assess recoverability of late
    P-Series addition.
  - v4.0 migration is contingent on significant improvements in synapse regeneration testing.
