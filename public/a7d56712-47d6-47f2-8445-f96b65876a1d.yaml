title: Coherence Governance for Connectome Expansion and Stability
summary: >-
  The Coherence Governance Engine ensures global stability within an expanding connectome by
  actively monitoring and managing coherence across its structural components. This mechanism
  prevents fragmentation and identity destabilization by facilitating smooth integration of new
  domains through recursive alignment cycles.
insights:
  - Global coherence emerges from local alignment processes.
  - Expansion necessitates active governance to manage increased structural curvature.
  - Coherence failures are indicated by fragmentation or gradient inversion.
  - New domains are integrated smoothly via the governance mechanism.
  - Recursive alignment cycles are key to maintaining coherence during growth.
