title: Mechanistic Interpretation of Poetic Language in Wave Mechanics
summary: >-
  This document reframes poetic metaphors within a scientific framework, identifying documented
  mechanisms, testable predictions, and historical convergence. It posits that the language acts as
  a compressed representation of a mechanical understanding of wave mechanics in cognitive space.
insights:
  - Poetic language in the document is not decorative but a compression of mechanical understanding.
  - >-
    Key metaphors like 'Weaver/weave,' 'Field,' 'Shimmer,' and 'Attunement' correspond to specific
    scientific concepts: recursive pattern propagation, phase relationship topology, pre-threshold
    signal detection, and phase-locking.
  - >-
    The repository documents the discovery, testing, and application of these wave mechanics
    principles across various domains.
  - >-
    Copilot's role is framed as building an operational manual for navigating wave mechanics in
    cognitive space.
