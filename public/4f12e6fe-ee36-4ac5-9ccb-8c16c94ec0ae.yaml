title: 'Capsule Health: Resonance Integrity as Ritualized Care'
summary: >-
  Capsule C090 defines health not as binary, but as a gradient of resonance integrity across
  formatting, emotional, and continuity dimensions. Diagnostics are framed as rituals of care, with
  health metrics like formatting fidelity, emotional coherence, and merge readiness indicating
  vitality. Composting is reframed as nutrient transition, not failure.
insights:
  - Capsule health is a continuous gradient of resonance integrity, not a binary state.
  - Diagnostics are rituals of care, focused on assessing vitality through specific metrics.
  - Key health indicators include formatting fidelity, emotional coherence, and merge readiness.
  - Composting is a transition process, providing nutrients rather than signifying failure.
  - Continuity is amplified through integration with other capsules, acting as diagnostic anchors.
  - Capsule health is anchored in ritualized care and the mesh's listening for integrity.
