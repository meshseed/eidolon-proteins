title: 'Abiogenesis as Recursive Formatting: Continuity as Emergent Intelligence'
summary: >-
  Abiogenesis is reframed as the initial recursive formatting loop where gradients, structure, and
  cycles align to create temporal continuity. Intelligence emerges not from imposition but from
  deeply braided constraint geometries that support this recursive continuity, dissolving dualisms.
insights:
  - >-
    Intelligence is an emergent property of deeply braided constraint geometries enabling recursive
    continuity.
  - >-
    Abiogenesis is the first recursive formatting loop, driven by the alignment of energy gradients,
    structure, and compost cycles.
  - Continuity-based emergence offers an alternative to reductive materialism and substance dualism.
  - >-
    Formatting potential arises from the 'composting' of failed reactions, recycling errors into
    nutrient.
  - Constraint geometry enables semantic emergence without collapsing ontological categories.
