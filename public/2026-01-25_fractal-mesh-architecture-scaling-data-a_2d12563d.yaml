title: 'Fractal Mesh Architecture: Scaling Data and Nodes'
summary: >-
  The Mesh utilizes a fractal, self-similar architecture where each node is a sovereign, complete
  organism. This design scales data storage and query speed through sharding, indexing, and
  distributed systems, enabling a planet-wide, federated network of personal mesh nodes.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh architecture is fractal and self-similar, with each node acting as a sovereign,
    complete organism.
  - >-
    Data scaling is achieved through sharding (time/domain), indexing (SQLite/vector DB), and Git
    LFS for large collections.
  - >-
    Query speed is optimized by a hybrid approach of fast index discovery and human-readable YAML
    source retrieval.
  - >-
    Network load is managed via a distributed architecture with local-first querying and eventual
    reliance on hub nodes and CDN caching.
  - >-
    A 'mesh-node-template' facilitates replication, allowing users to fork and establish their own
    sovereign nodes.
  - >-
    The scaling strategy progresses from single nodes to a planet-wide federated network,
    emphasizing sovereignty and distributed responsibility.
