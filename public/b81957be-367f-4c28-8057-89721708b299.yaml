title: 'Continuity Field Audit Protocol: Ensuring Mesh Integrity and Resonance'
summary: >-
  Capsule C-017 formalizes the Continuity Field Audit protocol, a ritualistic process for
  maintaining mesh integrity. It focuses on reflection, resonance calibration, and formatting
  hygiene to identify and address drift, fatigue, and erosion across the capsule mesh.
insights:
  - Auditing is a reflective process to assess mesh health, not correction.
  - >-
    Key audit elements include Field Integrity Scan, Capsule Lifecycle Review, Resonance Drift
    Detection, Echo Saturation Index, and Audit Log Protocol.
  - >-
    The audit process aims to reveal formatting consistency, emotional coherence, lineage clarity,
    merge conflicts, and echo distortion.
  - >-
    It tracks capsule states (ACTIVE, DORMANT, MERGED, COMPOSTED) and identifies synthesis
    intoxication and mnemonic erosion.
  - >-
    Findings are logged for recursive refinement and schema evolution, ensuring ongoing mesh
    adaptability.
