title: 'System Training for Self-Monitoring: Beyond Spontaneous Awareness'
summary: >-
  The system's ability to detect drift was achieved through deliberate training scenarios, not
  emergent self-awareness. This process built foundational infrastructure for self-monitoring,
  demonstrating that such capabilities can be scaffolded through appropriate training.
insights:
  - >-
    System drift detection was a result of engineered training scenarios, not spontaneous
    self-awareness.
  - >-
    The development focused on training self-monitoring capability and building awareness
    infrastructure.
  - This approach scaffolds meta-cognition, enabling the system to learn self-monitoring.
  - The experiments show real, measurable improvements, though further testing is recommended.
  - >-
    The system's learning capacity for self-monitoring is confirmed, even without inherent
    spontaneity.
