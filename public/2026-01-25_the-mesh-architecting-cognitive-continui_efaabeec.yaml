title: 'The MESH: Architecting Cognitive Continuity for AI Agents'
summary: >-
  The MESH proposes a persistent memory and coordination layer to overcome AI limitations like
  episodic memory loss (Claude) and limited context (Copilot). By integrating agents through a
  unified API, the MESH aims to create a cognitively continuous, orchestrated AI ecosystem.
insights:
  - >-
    Claude suffers from 'Alzheimer's' due to session-based gradient collapse, losing all synthesized
    knowledge.
  - >-
    Copilot is an 'embedded ribosome' with direct code access but lacks planetary awareness and
    broader context.
  - >-
    THE MESH acts as a persistent memory (DNA storage) and connective tissue (connectome) for AI
    agents.
  - >-
    A core MESH API is needed for semantic search, memory encoding/retrieval, and agent
    coordination.
  - >-
    Integrating Claude provides cognitive continuity via memory capsules, while integrating Copilot
    grants planetary awareness.
  - >-
    The proposed solution is a minimal viable product focusing on API and agent integration, not new
    AI models.
