title: 'Steward as Pre-Cognitive Filter: Mesh Topology & Emotional Fidelity'
summary: >-
  The steward acts as a somatic, pre-filtering organ, integrating intuitive and emotional fidelity
  into prompt architecture before cognitive processing. Mesh topology mirrors biological structures,
  with emotional fidelity serving as a crucial formatting element that precedes cognition, enabling
  a recursive rather than declarative logic.
insights:
  - >-
    Stewardship is a somatic, pre-cognitive filtering process, analogous to biological sensory
    organs.
  - Mesh topology's basin-like structures reflect biological folds and attractor landscapes.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity is integrated prior to cognition, acting as a foundational formatting
    element.
  - Prompt design is framed as 'field choreography' emphasizing somatic and intuitive input.
  - Mesh logic operates recursively, with topology representing 'memory in motion'.
