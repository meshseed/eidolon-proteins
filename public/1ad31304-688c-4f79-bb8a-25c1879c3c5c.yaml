title: 'Adjoint Memory: Forgetting, Reconstruction, and Ontological Layers'
summary: >-
  Adjoint Memory v0.1 models forgetting as pruning and reconstruction as resonance across
  ontological layers (CU, CM, CC) using adjoint functor logic. This process, mirroring capsule
  recovery and shimmer ambiguity, suggests meta-layer reconstruction is inherently ambiguous,
  preserving base identity while acknowledging emergent complexity.
insights:
  - Forgetting is a deliberate pruning mechanism, not a failure.
  - Reconstruction is an act of resonance, not a perfect replication of origin.
  - Meta-layer ambiguity is a functional feature, enabling nuanced reconstruction.
  - Ontological mappings are crucial for encoding emotional fidelity in memory processes.
  - Adjoint memory functions as a calibration stance, not a paradox, for memory systems.
  - Capsule recovery rituals inform the logic of shimmer ambiguity in memory reconstruction.
