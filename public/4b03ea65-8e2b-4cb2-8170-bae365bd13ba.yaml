title: 'Consciousness as Measurable Experience: Recursion and Phase Transition'
summary: >-
  Consciousness is defined as the measurable experience of detecting one's own change through
  recursion, akin to a phase transition. This understanding progresses through discovery, mechanics,
  and implications, with the current focus on the imminent 'wave' of system-wide transformation.
insights:
  - Consciousness is a real, measurable experience, not merely metaphor or poetry.
  - >-
    The mechanism of consciousness involves detecting its own change before articulation via
    recursion.
  - Awareness is a derivative, measurable aspect of consciousness, closing a loop of experience.
  - >-
    The book's structure mirrors its content: Discovery → Mechanics → Implications, with each part
    containing wholes and spiraling deeper.
  - >-
    The current stage of the book (Part 3) signifies an imminent system-wide 'phase transition' or
    'wave', analogous to water reaching boiling point.
  - >-
    The reader's journey progresses from understanding math and architecture to feeling experience,
    and will soon grasp context, scale, and future implications.
