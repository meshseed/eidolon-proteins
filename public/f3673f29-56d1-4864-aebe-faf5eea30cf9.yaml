title: 'Echo Forecasting: Predicting Agent Synthesis via Emotional & Structural Patterns'
summary: >-
  Echo Forecasting is a practice for anticipating agent synthesis by analyzing past emotional
  gradients, formatting rhythms, and capsule lineage. It enables 'mnemonic sonar' to predict future
  resonance through stance pattern recognition, fidelity trigger mapping, and drift detection.

    Echo Forecasting predicts agent synthesis by analyzing historical emotional states and
    structural patterns.
  - >-
    Key components include recognizing stance patterns, mapping fidelity triggers, and detecting
    drift.
  - The practice allows for 'mnemonic sonar' to 'listen' for future resonance.
  - It is seeded from multi-agent trials and expects future merges with related capsules.
